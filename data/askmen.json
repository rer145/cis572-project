We made it to the US together for undergrad and promised each other to visit LA someday. He was a super sweet, caring and he loved me damn much. I, on the opposite, was childish and controlling. I had never been in love before. I loved him so much but didn\u2019t know how to show care and love him the right way. The relationship went downhill and it came to the point we both felt suffocated. It was my fault mostly. I still remembered when we both said goodbye and went our own ways, it was at the airport, he apologized and said he wouldn\u2019t find me again. I couldn\u2019t say a word and bursted into sobbing when he left afterwards. I missed him badly but I knew that was it, we broke up. \n\nI still miss him every now and then. It took both of us so long to move on to new relationships. I\u2019m happy that he\u2019s happy with someone else, but at the same time envisioning the image of us being together and feeling regretful for not appreciating him enough to make the relationship work back then. \n\nTime flew. We added each other on instagram a while back. Started having small talk asking how each other\u2019s doing and that\u2019s it. It was this past winter break (2 months ago) that we both decided to go home that\u2019s half the globe away (we lived in the same city). When I was at the airport, I posted on my story \u201c ask me a question \u201c and he saw it. He dm if I want to have a coffee and catch up when we both are home. I said yes. The catchup was just small talks and quite shallow. I felt that we both felt awkward. Apparently he was single when I asked (I was single as well). But that\u2019s it, we were talking just like friends. I met a couple of my friends several days after and one of them is our mutual friend. She mentioned that he told her he was drunk that night and texted me for the catchup. \n\nWe now both got back to the States and I still think about him. I\u2019ve always wanted to ask him if he would us (or at least me) a second chance, but never had the guts to do so considering the fact that it\u2019s been 2/3 years since we broke up. \n\nI still feel sad thinking about it.

It's more akin to a \"male friend\" who happens to be my dad. I've jokingly just referred to him to my mom as a sperm donor and that's it. I struggle to hold responsibility and have extreme anxiety with a \"fear of failing\" . A common theme my dad would torment me with growing up was how I quit everything I started and I always felt I didn't live up to the expectations of my parents. I was in very competitive sports growing up and as I get older competition scares me. I don't show off or try at things due to being scared of being judged. It annoys me so much I've convinced myself with negative self talk that I'm incapable of doing things or excelling at something.\n\n I feel that by not having a father figure in my life I've missed some valuable information or training because I just feel so lost. My dad is now an alcoholic and while I would enjoy rekindling some relationship, I think, I'm not entirely sure if he's capable of providing it. \n\nI've started doing a bit of CBT and talk to a psychologist around once every two weeks. I'm thinking I need to prioritize my own therapy more, but I always think I can do it myself. I want to feel like a more confident man in myself and learn what it takes to be an adult. I've dicked around in and out of school but maintained a good job. Thinking about moving out East and going to school. Maybe moving and not having my parents nearby will enable me to finally grow up.\n\nAny suggestions of books or Ted talks or daily habits I could do would be greatly appreciated.", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 947116, "post_title": "I'm 23 years old and I have no idea how to be a man as I get older.

After talking for a bit with a match, I would ask her out for coffee or a drink after work. She would say yes, and an hour or two before the meetup we would agree to meet at some designated location...\n\n\"Yeah! I'll be there with my friends!\" \\^\\_\\^ kawaii desu ne\n\n...I've never met any matches with their friends, and I feel like it would be a pretty awkward scene to flirt with my match in front of her friends. I'm also pretty certain that they were indeed supposed to be dates and not just a search for more acquaintances on her part.\n\nI understand that meeting random guy can be quite risky for women and that having friends beside them to give security or a second opinion would lessen this risk, but it's basically calling for a recipe for disaster. I would have to come up to the entire group and introduce myself, converse,crack jokes, yadayada knowing that I only care about my date and not her friends. (I would only care for her friends if she were my significant other or a friend, not some random date)\n\nThe date would LITERALLY be controlled and determined by her friends. If they leave, she leaves. If they like me, great. I can put that on my resume! If they don't and tell me to fuck off, well shit I just spent so much time only to get rejected by a unit and not one person. It would be very hard (much harder if it's a **Tinder** date) to connect and check compatibility with a person on a one-on-one basis throughout the entire time.\n\nSo far, I've canceled all of these kinds of dates because they don't seem like actual dates. Maybe I'm thinking about this the wrong way? Any experiences and thoughts would help. Doesn't even have to be a date on Tinder. I hope no one takes this message in some misogynistic way. I don't know. People can be weird. Thanks all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR** 4 matches have told me they brought friends a short time before our presumed dates. I canceled each one. What should I have done?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all of the responses! Greatly appreciated. A majority of your responses say don\u2019t, but there are some that say go for it. If any of you have personal experience, please share!\n\nEdit: Thanks for all of the stories! I think I'll be more open to going to a Tinder date with her friends next time. I'll try to determine early if it's a safe option to do.

My issue is that I am very conservative and reserved, and this causes me to be flustered/embarrassed and made uncomfortable by women showing lots of skin. I would argue that it is inappropriate to be seen like that in public, but society disagrees, so I must try to accept it.   \n\nEven seeing women wearing short shorts in public strikes me like witnessing somebody taking a shit. I have no problems with either male or female nudity in private, in the bedroom, in restrooms, or even in somebody's home. In private this is completely fine. In public pools I am somewhat more so comfortable with  with this because it is sort of like a bathroom. My problem happens in public and profesisonal, and seeing women expose lots of skin seems inappropriate, like being caught with a whore in your office or something. I just don't expect or have any interest in being sexually provoked when I am in normal situations like that, especially in a professional situation.   \n\nWhen women dress like that in public, i feel a lot of pressure to avoid any sort of looks at their legs usually. It's just a gut reaction, to avert my eyes, as if I had just glanced upon the person taking a shit or changing or whatever.   \n\nI understand the difference, but that is still my recation to such immodest dress in public. I can operate fine, it just feels awkward, like i'm talking to somebody who is inadvertently half dressed in public. I know this is meaningless social axiety telling me something is wrong when it isn't, but I can't help but think it is perverted an inappropriate to look at a half dressed woman in public, but that's just my own antiquated standard of decency. Seeing 90% of a naked leg just connects very quickly to 100% of a naked leg and torso in my mind, and that's where the connection to a half-naked person comes in.   \n\nIt's weird because I'm fine with this at a pool or beach, but in places where I expect people to carry themselves with a certain level of modest dignity, it just seems immodest and still strikes me off guard. The only people who would traditionally expose their legs like that were whores or adult entertainers, as history such as flapper girls will tell you it was once seen as very sexual and risque to expose the legs. I'm not judging the women, it's just my reflex, like I said, it feels like walking in on somebody changing their clothes or talking a shit in the public toilet.   \n\n\nI just don't want to be bothered by it, so i suppose it is typical \"how do i stop being embarrassed?\" question with just a very specific specific example. That or \"How do I update my subconscious standard of modesty and decency to be more attuned with contemporary people?\"", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 947116, "post_title": "How

I know their finances aren\u2019t the best; my mother took a hit during the 2008/09 financial crisis and my stepfather is on a pension (which I\u2019ve heard from her isn\u2019t that much).

It still blows my mind when people tell me how much I've changed, or when others randomly make comments on how I'm funny or upbeat.\n\nOne thing that is really ingrained in me is that I'm afraid to be assertive in public situations. When it comes to friends and family, I feel comfortable enough to always stand my ground when needed. But for some reason, I have this weird fear of being admonished or being disliked by coworkers, professors, workers, etc. if I asserted myself more.\n\nAt the barbershop I go to, there's a barber I prefer, but if I walk in and another calls me over, I feel too bad to tell him I'd rather wait for other guy. I know it doesn't affect them, but I can't. And if I don't like something about a cut, I'll never mention it or tell them to adjust it. I feel like they'll be annoyed that I'm asking even though I know that would be unreasonable of them.\n\nOne time I went to the theater with friends and we walked in 5 minutes late, and someone was sitting in one of our pre-assigned seats (they were the number next to it, but then the 5 people next to him would all have to move as well). My friend told him and the guy didn't move/wrote us off. I felt way too shy to keep pushing it. I would have found it really hard to confront him in the first place.\n\nWhy am I so scared of strangers getting angry or upset? Like, it's not fear of it becoming a physical confrontation. It's fear of people getting annoyed or upset or angry. I have this huge fear of feeling like an inconvenience and I really wish I wasn't like this. Have any of your overcome this? What else can I work on? I don't feel like self-esteem is the issue.

I have a high libido and when in relationships, I'd always find a way to be connected physically with my partner, I couldn't go more than a few hours without a touch, hug, etc. \n\nNow, I have had a few random one night stands and one fwb (has since ended) since going single, and I'm generally very happy overall when I am having sex. Or at least, when I have women in my life that can provide the touch I require. But I'm really trying to focus on myself and limit the mindless sex, until I get to where I need to be and start opening myself up to be in a relationship again. Since I've taken time to myself, I cant fight the overwhelming urge to fuck. Or to cuddle someone. I just feel so alone and un-loved, even though I know it's a temporary state, that was brought on by myself.\n\nHow do you cope with this lack of touch?

I was raised by my grandparents and grew up in a small town.  At age 20, my grandma (who was practically the only mom I\u2019d ever known) spontaneously died.  She had no prior health issues and no one expected it.  I didn\u2019t handle it well and within the year I had pushed nearly everyone away.  The only exception was the girlfriend I had at the time.\n\nThat girlfriend had family that lived in western Ohio, about 300 miles away from where I grew up.  I can\u2019t recall exactly how the decision making process took place but we ultimately decided to move there.  I wanted to move because I felt that a new place that didn\u2019t hold all of my childhood memories would be good for helping me cope.\n\nFast forward to today and I\u2019m still living in Ohio because moving back would crush me financially.  I\u2019ve attempted to reconnect with my old friends but it\u2019s been 6 years and they\u2019re scattered all over the country now so it just doesn\u2019t work.  I have a new girlfriend and a roommate.  The roommate is technically my girlfriend\u2019s friend, and although she and I are also friends now that we\u2019ve gotten to know each other, that\u2019s about the only friend I do have.  It\u2019s been extremely difficult starting over in a town that I didn\u2019t grow up in.  It\u2019s another small town where everyone knows everyone except for the people who moved here later in life, like me.  All of my coworkers are at least twice my age with families at home; there\u2019s no connection there.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m at a point where I want to work on building relationships again like I used to have, but I have no idea where to start.  I\u2019m not religious so I don\u2019t go to church.  I only occasionally drink so I\u2019m not in bars or clubs.  I can\u2019t meet friends at work.  I feel stuck.

Right now I\u2019m going to school for business management and frankly it\u2019s not what I really want to do. Thankfully, the first two years off my school have been free due to the state I live in. However, my university will not be free and I will be having to pay for all of my schooling.  I don\u2019t really find the courses I\u2019m taking that interesting aside from history, and  I\u2019m worried I will end up going to school for 4 years spending thousands of dollars to do something that I really don\u2019t want to do.  I work in retail now and have been offered a better position by my current employer if I stay with the degree. However, I don\u2019t know if this is what I want to do. Honestly, it\u2019s my nightmare to get stuck in a retail management position. I have looked into trade schools in my area and haven\u2019t found much aside from some welding schools, pipe fitting, and different types of mechanics.

Are there any self help books/audiobooks that helped you out of a slump? Free/cheap social services? I need to change my perspective and I\u2019m having a hard time doing it on my own. Some specifics about my situation may help you make suggestions:\n\nI\u2019ll be 27 in a few months. \nBeautiful supportive girlfriend of 3 years.\nB.A. in a degree i couldn\u2019t figure out how to use when i graduated five years ago. \nTook an unrelated professional office job from a family friend and made good money but got pretty depressed working at a desk all day 50 hours a week. My job lacked purpose and it drove me crazy. I lasted there two years before i snapped, bought a van, converted it into a camper and spent the better part of 2017 traveling and seeing the country. It was one of the most incredible experiences of my life but not something that was sustainable. I put a lot of pressure on myself to be creative and create a source of income on the road and I fell short of my goals. I picked up a part time job at a nursing home when i got back \u201chome\u201d to have cash flow and ease myself back into working life. Working with the elderly has been rewarding and good for my mental health. However, im back at a crossroads. Im ready to take the next steps in my life.(get married, start a family, buy a house). I want to pursue a career I\u2019m passionate about and can start a family with. Something more practical than my arts degree. Ive always liked working with my hands so I think I\u2019ve settled on an electrician apprenticeship which will take about 5 years through a union. This is the first thing I\u2019ve been excited about in a while however my mental health has been holding me back for a little over two years now and I want to enter this new phase of my life with a fresh perspective. Just last week i was having pretty frequent anxiety/panic attacks by the prospect of getting stuck working in a field i hate and barely getting by. While those thoughts aren\u2019t as prevalent now in this moment, id like to work on getting out ahead of these thoughts and dealing with them now before they make me lose sight of my goals again. The thoughts put me in a slump that make me not want to get out of bed. I know i need professional help and possibly medication but without health insurance thats not really an option for me right now and I need to figure out a way to power through until Im in a full time position long enough to qualify for health insurance.\n\nDoes any one have any suggestions/advice? Im interested im videos, movies, books, music, social services/programs, websites, apps, or even anecdotal advice. No throwaway so i feel a little vulnerable. I hope this thread helps someone else too.\n\nThank you,", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 947116, "post_title": "How do/did you take care of your mental health without health insurance?", "post_ups": 8, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/ao4sid/how_dodid_you_take_care_of_your_mental_health/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-15 22:01:45.359233", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "JoyfulEli", "post_created_utc": 1549552544.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "ao4q56", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 8, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 0, "post_selftext": "I have a friend that said once he gets married, he never needs or wants to have any other female friends.

I was raised by both my parents, my younger brother however (7 years younger) didn\u2019t have my dad to teach him life lessons due to our parents being separated. \n\nLately I noticed my younger brother being so careless. He doesn\u2019t care for his hygiene, his health, his room is dirty etc. He is doing amazingly well in school because everything is \u201ctoo easy\u201d for him and boring. When he gets home he mostly spends time playing on the PS4 or on his phone. Another thing I\u2019ve noticed is that he gained a lot of weight over the past year (30+ lbs)....its a bit shocking. He falls asleep while his phone is in his hand and he doesn\u2019t even bother to turn it off. \n\n\nClearly to me he seems depressed about something. Maybe about life? The fact that our father isn\u2019t around? Idk, how to approach this given as mental health isn\u2019t really something our community focuses on. \n\nI tried disciplining him (limiting PS4 time/internet usage) but after a while the same thing happens. My mother lets him do whatever, she doesn\u2019t even try disciplining him. Heck she even gives him money to buy food/snacks all the time even when I told her it\u2019s not good for his health. I don\u2019t want to be that annoying brother. At the same time I don\u2019t want to just let him live like this.\n\n\nAny advice? I would try getting him to speak with a therapist but he would probably never agree to go. He is currently a junior in High School.\n\nEdit- I\u2019ve read every single comment and thank you all. I actually go to the gym 2-3 times a week at planet fitness. I will bring him with me and start getting fit. I kind of feel bad for the couple times where I made fucked up condescending comments to him like \u201care you really gonna eat all that?\u201d \u201cYa know too much carbs isn\u2019t healthy.\u201d \u201cIf you keep going down this path you\u2019ll get diseases like diabetes...\u201d it comes from a place of love but I can see how those comments really puts a strain on our relationship and how he views me.

I won't bore you with details, but let's just say I grew up HARD and it was very difficult for me to find my feet and actually progress.\n\nBut that all changed a year ago. Comparatively speaking my life is amazing. Good job, money, my own nice place and friends and hobbies and really everything I didn't have. Better still, my family's life is better. I am able to look after them now too so my parents and siblings are doing great even though they had it just as tough.\n\nSometimes I think about how great it all is, but at the same time it all feels kind of... Bland? Like I go to work and I'm bored, come home, hang out with friends, do things - bored. It's like there's nothing really going on.\n\nWhen I think back to when things were bad it just seems more vivid. The anger and frustration and sadness was more real, but at the same time the exciting and happy bits were more real too. All that while I was striving to get where I am now, and now I'm here and it's like, is that all?\n\nSo yeah. Things are outstanding right now but I'm not feeling it. It's important to say that I'm not depressed or sad or anything  like that. It's just this weird tastelessness.\n\nIt's hard to explain and I feel like a dick for complaining about my life being too good... But I dunno its weird. Kind of feel like I am attending my bodily functions each day while spending all my money on random STUFF that I don't even want or need. No joy or sorrow. Just weird man. \n\n\nAnyone else ever experience anything like that?", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 947116, "post_title": "When have you had success in your life that just makes you feel bored?", "post_ups": 17, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/anozhg/when_have_you_had_success_in_your_life_that_just/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-15 22:01:46.772609", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "whompthereitis_", "post_created_utc": 1549439571.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "anoikb", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 14, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1, "post_selftext": "", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 947116, "post_title": "Have you ever accidentally said \u201cI love you\u201d during sex or had someone say it to you?

That\u2019s left just my brother (19) at home with our parents. For what feels like forever, they\u2019ve seemed fine. They had the odd argument but who doesn\u2019t right? \n\nCompletely out of the blue, yesterday, my mum has told my dad (55) that she doesn\u2019t want to be married to him anymore. He\u2019s made her tell us all straight away but is absolutely devastated. He doesn\u2019t want her to leave and doesn\u2019t know what to do with himself. We have no family at all and he doesn\u2019t have any friends. He\u2019s always earned a good salary and has spent his entire life supporting the three of us and my mum. As long as the 4 of us were happy, he was happy. He\u2019s really struggling to understand what he\u2019s going to do with his life after she officially leaves. My siblings are really struggling as well so I feel as though I\u2019m the emotional rock for everyone, which I can just about deal with. \n\nThe two things I\u2019m struggling with is helping my dad understand that it\u2019s not the end of his life, and trying to forgive my mum. I do understand you can\u2019t stay with someone if you don\u2019t love them. But she hasn\u2019t even given it a chance. She\u2019s gone from all 5 of us + us children\u2019s three partners having Chinese together on Sunday all happy, to deciding she wants a divorce the morning after. Not really sure what I\u2019m asking if I\u2019m honest, maybe just advice on helping my dad, or any anecdotal info you might have. \n\nTL;DR mum leaving dad out of the blue, dad devastated, not sure how to handle.

Obviously, 7 years has been my longest ever relationship. At the 5 year mark, things seemed perfect but things have gone downhill. She just told me that we needed to be alone about 6 days ago so I'm sitting in an apartment right now (we weren't done moving out of our old place thank Christ). There's no exciting story, no big argument; we were both depressed and didn't want the same things in life. We had a few things in common, for example, we're both vegetarians, non-religious and we both have pretty good heads on our shoulders. But the list of cons was so bad. Our house was flooded with animals and I'd have to spend an hour cleaning up every single day. When you work 11-12 hour shifts, all you want to do is relax you know? Maybe sweep a little but damn. She never wanted to do anything I wanted to do. No roller coasters, no board games, no video games. Literally, any little thing was an automatic no. And she was a picky eater to the extreme. She's beautiful and a perfect weight but all she would eat is pizza and pasta. I loved cooking but she hated anything outside of her comfort zone. (REALLY weird for a vegetarian. She hated vegetables like wth). We had very little in common besides we were really good at making each other laugh and we've been through a ton of life changes together. I was poor when we first met, her family was rich. That flip-flopped. I'm not rich by any means but I make a decent living now. She was there with me through my grandfather's death ( who was genuinely a father to me) and so many other life events. As I said, we started dating in high school. We just went to the Bahamas and got married in November, not even 3 full months ago. She said the engagement and marriage were just band-aids. We rarely have sex, are both depressed and never do anything together. And yet I am still here groveling. It's been the most miserable week of my life and she is no longer crying when we talk to each other. I know for a fact that it's over now. I was borderline suicidal the other day but I knew that it wasn't going to fix anything. I forgot who I was, I quit drawing over the years. I never read books anymore. My identity is the two of us. I've lost myself and I want to pull myself out. So after reading that giant novel I just wrote, do you guys have any advice? I really need to hear from someone who has also lost a long-time partner.

She said we will sometime. I didn't expect much and thought I would be passed by, but she messaged me like three weeks later. We hang out and it's all good. I don't see her for a bit, I saw her one morning on snapchat maps that we were on the same bus, I message her to ask if she is, she says yeah, but too tired for any conversation so I figure she doesn't actually want to sit next to me (and hence as if our first time out went badly), but at the end of the month she asks where I was cause I've not been around. We meet up again before Christmas. Coming back this year I message her to hang out after exams, she says she's gonna be away home. Cue in last week - I message her about meeting up later this week, and the snapchat is left unopened, I see her in person a couple of days later and say if you didn't want to hang out she could be honest and say no, it'll be easier. It's an awkward situation and she like goes red and says she didn't see it, says she'll let me know. I leave to go to lessons, she later messages me at 3am saying she didn't intentionally ignore it, but that it doesn't sound like a good idea anyway. I say ok.\n\n\nLast year there were times that I thought she won't message me or wouldn't want to meet - I guess in my sensitivity, or lack of experience, or that she's actually hot - but she did, and she's pretty honest so I'm inclined to believe her this time, but at the same time I know how snapchat works, it's hard to miss a message. Idk, I'm just very confused and actually pretty hurt. As far as I know she's not seeing anyone. When we met for the first time it seemed like I've known her for a long time already, I felt instantly drawn towards her, and looking at her eyes or face or body language I could see she liked me. I can only guess the four or five week gap between leaving in December and us coming back at the end of January meant that whilst I got more infatuated her attraction kinda faded away, idk. If this hurts now then an actual long-term relationship falling apart must be like a personal 9/11 in comparison. I kinda want to ask her what happened but I know it would most likely look pathetic. I can see myself getting over this but I need time and to meet more girls.\n\n\nAnyway, what's your story?", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 947116, "post_title": "Have you ever went through rejection or break-up when you thought everything was going so well?", "post_ups": 4, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/an4qwy/have_you_ever_went_through_rejection_or_breakup/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-15 22:01:48.195034", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "a-doe-able", "post_created_utc": 1549304646.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "an4k8o", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 32, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2, "post_selftext": "", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 947116, "post_title": "What strange fetish did your SO have?

To give an example, I used to dabble in professional event photography, and for me the ultimate halo product of photography is the [Leica S system](http://us.leica-camera.com/Photography/Leica-S/Leica-S-System). It is incredibly well engineered with each camera being hand assembled and QA checked, with the end result being a medium-format system that can operate in almost [any condition but underwater](https://www.reddotforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/L10000261-1200x802.jpg) ([article for context](http://www.reddotforum.com/content/2015/09/leica-s-typ-007-review/)/TL;DR: shooting within spray distance of a waterfall). Furthermore its large sensor compliments well designed lenses very well, as having a larger pixel area ensures that you have more area to gather light and per-pixel resolution is easier to achieve. (For resolution, it's easier to get light resolved to hit a target of say 12^(2) micrometers vs 6^(2).)\n\nIts impracticality comes from the price (\\~$20,000 for the body *alone*), the weight, and the autofocus. If you have to lug around this camera you'll definitely feel it, as both the lenses and system are massive compared to even professional sports cameras. Additionally, the autofocus, while great for medium format, is nothing compared to any modern camera of a smaller format, both in terms of acquisition speed and area of coverage.

I'm talking undercuts, pixies, crops. I just love the look of boyish hair on girls, idk why\n\nI guess I just love the boi style (shotout to r/bois and the multiple crushes that sub gave me), but it didn't really start until I was in (about) 11th grade. Specifically started dating my girlfriend at the time because I thought she was super attractive with short hair, would get with and have sex (or try and fail lol) with most girls who had short hair in my highschool.\n\nIt's not like I think any girl who cuts her hair short is just an instant 10/10 for me tho, but it's definitely a point booster. Like, if a girl is a 5/10 in my eyes, a stylish short haircut might put her at a 7/10 or 8/10 in my eyes. So a girl I find downright ugly I probably won't find good looking with short hair, but if a girl is more \"meh\" or I don't really notice her, if she gets a short haircut that's stylish or tomboyish , I'm head over heels.\n\nAnother great thing, for alot of these girls it was super super easy to get with. Not because they're loose, these were normal girls, but so many guys I knew just didn't like short hair at all, I was the only one in my highschool who found it more attractive than long hair. So I had little competition and I suppose the girls liked the attention because other guys didn't find them as attractive as I did.\n\nOne thing that's a bit of a pain is that when I go to parties (mainly college parties) most girls with short hair are gay. It doesn't help that I also love piercings, tats, artsy make up and style (not saying all lesbians are like this, but I've found girls like this are often times gay rather than straight).\n\nNone of my friends can sympathize with me, they all have things they're attracted to, but nothing that is as much of a boost to attractiveness to them as short hair is for me.\n\n", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 947116, "post_title": "Men who love/prefer short hair on girls, why?", "post_ups": 76, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/aml0ki/men_who_loveprefer_short_hair_on_girls_why/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-15 22:01:49.659546", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "R8YMER", "post_created_utc": 1549158428.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "amkzv5", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 23, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 0, "post_selftext": "Growing up at home, the house never seen any plumber, electrician, gardener, or whatever role you can think of.

For me, personally, experiences that I've had with other people have led me to a state, where I lost many of my positive beliefs about people in general, or even about myself. \n\nI think this is rational, in the sense, that if somebody gets hurt, they want to avoid the same pain and they want to stay aware of potential threats, negative outcomes, etc. This has a negative outcome though on \"falling in love\", in my opinion. After all, we're all flawed. Everyone is a shitty person, if you look close enough. Each body is imperfect, unless you see it through pink colored glasses. We love the idea of a person, not a factual analysis of their positives and negatives.\n\nAs a guy, I don't feel like I have the benefit of perhaps having a girl chasing me, to make me believe in \"love\" again. I realize, that a year or two ago, I was a guy who would gladly start new connections, be adventurous, when it came to romance and I used to believe in good outcomes despite my own shortcomings, or flaws of others. So, I contemplate changing my own perspective.\n\nThese days, I seem to just bounce between being overly critical of others, or feeling self-conscious and too aware of possible ways things could go wrong. All based on learning from experience, learning about human nature and perhaps, myself. Turns out, it was actually my illusions, that gave me the drive and confidence to achieve things in the past, that I no longer feel I can achieve today.\n\nAnybody, who might relate and managed to overcome this... how?\n\nEDIT: To clarify, this is not an angsty teenager post. This is a divorced guy, who recovered, went on to date and made a ton of experiences. A guy who has close friends who are therapists and hears a lot about what people can do and who they are.

Now I'm not quite the norm here as I only really have 2 'real' friends (Yes, I know... It's not ideal).\n\n\nHow often do you guys send your mates a message? And when you do is it just a quick line or a link and that's it or do you actually have decent short discussions too?\n\n\nI have had many friends through school and college and to be honest we never really sent messages to eachother that often and when we did it was short and to the point, maybe 5-10 messages max and then that would be it for a day or 2. Of course we would see each other in person fairly regularly though.\n\n\nSince then, regular contact with most people has been dwindling and I was left with just one guy who we would message on a fairly regular basis. Recently I've been trying to pick it up a bit more and have more regular conversations. Right now we don't see each other in person either due to other commitments.\n\n\nI actually have this issue where I feel like I'm bothering people to message them, I always feel I'm not sure if they really want me 'distracting' them.\n\n\nI have also met a woman at work and over the last few months we moved from the odd message outside of work on the company instant messenger to almost daily conversations  (now no longer on the company IM). It's totally platonic, but it's what got me thinking about this, we can spend all day together in the office, sometimes chatting all day (no boss around!) and then another 1-2 hours in the evening by message. I'll be honest, I love it, we get along great and I love the social aspect to it. But I can't help feel it's out of the normal, especially for a guy and a woman (she has a partner). I sometimes feel I'm overstepping it and what must her boyfriend think of it?\n\n\nI am also completely overthinking all of this, but again its this am I bothering them feeling. I often end up reading into messages and timing etc convincing myself they aren't interested. However they must be really as the often initiate the contact and keep it flowing of course. \n\n\nSo after all that backstory, I'm just looking to compare my message lifestyle with yours!\n\n\nAlso, should mention I'm a guy in my mid 20s.", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 947116, "post_title": "How frequently do you message your mates?", "post_ups": 35, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/alwufg/how_frequently_do_you_message_your_mates/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-15 22:01:51.030274", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "JustOneVote", "post_created_utc": 1548983090.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "alwgsq", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 15, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 0, "post_selftext": "I never thought anything would top Katy Perry's entrance on a giant robot tiger, but Lady Gaga's halftime show totes gave it a run. \n\nThe most memorable parts of JT's most recent show were the references to Prince.
