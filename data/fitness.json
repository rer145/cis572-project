We fill the brown cars that you see driving around all day. I have been working there since last October and have been struggling with general exhaustion and muscle fatigue every day. Rarely pain unless really overworked. I am starting to burn out and when I discussed it with my boss he said that it should have only taken 2 weeks for my body to adjust to the physical demands of the job, (Questionable?), it has been 5 months. \n\nThis is the first time in my life I have exercised heavily and regularly and could use any advice on how to make this more sustainable. The job is only part time, but I find myself being so exhausted that I am unable to do anything else with my day.\n\n\u2014 \nBelow here is a list of details about diet, work load, etc. \n\u2014\n\nI am 5\u2019 10\u201d and currently averaging 162 each week with expected variations. I started work in October weighing 180. I have not only seen weight loss but muscle growth in shoulders, arms, and legs.\n\nThe jobs consists of loading 1000-1400 packages a day. The packages that I carry without aid are from 1-80 pounds of every size imaginable. Some days are heavier than others. Tuesday and Thursday always being heaviest. I bring these packages down from a moving bin at just above chest height and lift them anywhere from the ground to above my head. I am doing all I can to ensure lifting form and physical safety concerns. (Aka bend knees, don\u2019t twist back, keep package close, etc.) Motion is a brisk walk at all times.I step up about 3 feet to climb up into the package bins.  (My iPhone stats average 7-10 miles a day, stairs climbed is laughably inconsistent!) A shift last 5-6 hours with no breaks.\n\nI sleep 6-8 hours a night, often I find myself napping during the day though I try not too. \n\nI hydrate as much as I can usually, 20-40oz per shift. Water only. I try to balance it so I do not lose to much time peeing. I make sure to hydrate heavily at home.\n\nI generally eat two large meals a day, ensuring protein in both meals. I do not eat before work or during work. I eat varying things, but try to not to get to heavy in carbs, always have veggies, and protein. I eat out/have junk no more than twice a week but break sometimes and have junk when desperate for calories/stressed. \n\nI stretch before, during, and after work. \n\nThank you for any and all advice. I have tried tweaking all these elements but am struggling to see the big picture.\n\nEdit: I thought I found a balance with eating because my weight stabilized, but clearly not. I will eat more and find a calorie tracker to keep myself honest. I feel silly for this but I am new. When I first started reading the wiki I struggled to compare the workload to both the clear work out routines and intensity level calorie calculators. How would I classify a workout routine like this?\n\nEdit edit: I will eat more carbs, come at me spaghetti.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6938056, "post_title": "Struggling with physically intense job.

I've been going 5 days a week (Monday to Friday) in the mornings before work, so I've only got an hour or so to get my workout in. Currently doing a PPL split which I'm enjoying. It allows me to hit muscle groups twice a week (apart from legs, but I'm ok with that).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExercises I'm focusing on as part of my training are below (note: I go for 6-8 reps on pretty much all exercises with a weight that makes the last rep or two a bit of a struggle).

I'm a pretty average guy (5'10\" 160 pounds) but I have relatively high body fat percentage. I've been lifting for about three months but what I'm wondering here is which I should train for (density, 4-6 reps or hypertrophy, 8-12 reps) for the best overall look. Obviously if I'm going for the look I'd want to go for size, right? But as I've been reading, going for hypertrophy apparently results in bigger muscles but more \"fat\" looking muscles and more temporary (size can fade in as little as a few days without working out.) So I decided that I wanted to train for strength, for that lean muscle look; however, I'm afraid that this will result in my physical appearance being small forever. Is it possible for me to do strength training and still get nice, toned and moderately sized muscles?

PB Lifts before starting Smolov JR; Bench - 125kg, Squat 190kg, Deadlift 210kg. I basically decided to run Smolov Jr for just Bench initially, to break a plateau Ive been at for the last few months and to try and address my serious poverty bench! Squat has always been my most comfortable lift so figured Id run them concurrently. I'd read a few posts about people who had done this, to varying degrees of success so I figured I'd see how it plays out for me!\n\n\nMy plan for the four weeks is;    \n\nWeek 1\n\n(*)Day 1 6x6 - Squat 130/Bench 85\n\n(*)Day 2 7x5 - Squat 140/ Bench 90\n\n(*)Day 3 8x4 - Squat 150/Bench 95\n\n(*)Day 4 10x3 -Squat 160/Bench102.5\n\n\nWeek 2\n\n(*)Day 1 6x6 - Squat 135/Bench 90\n\n(*)Day 2 7x5 - Squat 145/ Bench 95\n\n(*)Day 3 8x4 - Squat 155/Bench 100\n\n(*)Day 4 10x3 -Squat 165/Bench107.5\n\n\nWeek 3\n\n(*)Day 1 6x6 - Squat 140/Bench 95\n\n(*)Day 2 7x5 - Squat 150/ Bench 100\n\n(*)Day 3 8x4 - Squat 160/Bench 105\n\n(*)Day 4 10x3 -Squat 170/Bench 112.5\n\n\nWeek 4\n\n(*)Rest - Test 1RM at the end of the week.\n\n\nPoints to note - I wear a belt for all my squats (personal preference) Knee sleeves on the 10x3 day. Wrist wraps and belt for benching on 8x4 and 10x3 days.\n\n\nOn some days so far Ive also managed to throw in some weighted ab pull downs, or some other form of weighted core work. Right now I'm just heading into work out 3 of week 2, so exactly half way through the plan.\n\n\nSome insight from my experience so far;\n\n\nI realised quickly that you cannot foam roll enough - I started out initially doing 10 minutes of foam rolling in the morning and after the sessions, but that's increased to maybe 20/25 minutes in the morning, before session and after sessions. Ive also had a couple of ice baths and hot baths which have really helped with recovery.\n\n\nMy hips are the most problematic area with this volume of squatting - I read a lot of posts and reviews, saying that Smolov can kill your knees/shoulders/traps but for me my hips have been the issue so far. The day after day 4 week 1, squatting heavy triples I really felt my hips just tighten up to the point where even sitting in the hole in an air squat felt really tight.\n\n\nSet 1/2/3 of any given day absolutely suck - Working back into the groove is really tough... But once I'm a couple of sets into any given day, my body seems to readjust and feel relatively normal again. I haven't had too bad Doms yet surprisingly, but my knees feel a little creaky and my lower back a little tight from the amount of squats!\n\n\nMy Bench feels surprisingly good - Prior to this Id benched mostly 2x per week, with the occasional 3x per week. So I was worried with how my shoulders would hold up to benching 4x per week. And so far so good - Some light face pulls, and some shoulder dislocations have been all Ive done so far, but it seems to have done the trick. Bench being my weakest lift I was naturally worried I'd have the more trouble with Bench over Squat, but that doesnt seem to be the case.\n\n\n10x3 doesnt suck as much as I was expecting - When I initially saw the programme and saw 10x3 Bench and Squat on the same day I was worried, firstly for the work load and secondly for the amount of time I'd be in the gym. Week 1, this session took me around an hour and forty five minutes. And its programmed on a weekend day, so mid afternoon on a Saturday my gym was pretty quiet and I had ample time to take long amounts of rest between sets. \n\n\nIll probably update this again once I've finished the plan, and tested my 1RM at the end of week 4 to see if all the work was worth it! Hoping to get close to 200kg on Squat, and close 132.5 on Bench.\n\n\nAnybody else ran this or a similar plan and had success?\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6938056, "post_title": "Currently Running Smolov Jr Bench & Squat", "post_ups": 4, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/aq8nlt/currently_running_smolov_jr_bench_squat/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-15 22:01:23.044712", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "ZenWanderer", "post_created_utc": 1550074746.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "aq88lk", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 12, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 0, "post_selftext": "I\u2019m currently running Starting Strength with some accessories (pull-ups, dips and face-pulls).\n\nStats are as follows: Male, 6\u20195\u201d, 30 years old, 90kg BW.\n\nDon\u2019t know my 1RMs but current working sets are: squat 110kg x 5, deadlift 115kg x 5, bench 70kg x 5, strict press 52.5 x 5.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t mind a bit of hypertrophy but primarily my goals are strength based.

Perhaps I could go on like this, as I am hitting my reps but they\u2019re so hard I don\u2019t look forward to them three days a week.

I'm lucky to get in a workout once a week, if at all. I've lost some size, and put on some unwanted weight. The extra hours out of the gym have lead to more boozing and more time in front of the TV. This problem is compounded by the fact that I sit at a desk. I have recently acquired a convertible stand up desk, so I'm at least not in a sitting position all day anymore.  I generally eat healthy during the week but tend to binge on the weekends. This wasn't a problem before because of how active I was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have also recently started taking medication for anxiety and stress. It first helped in the gym as I would often get pissed at others around me, but this medication took that edge off.  I'm afraid that this medication has contributed to my lack of push to work out. It has made me calmer, less angry, and I am much easier on myself, but a huge part of what kept me working so hard for so long was the fact that I was hard on myself. I unfortunately don't believe I'm ready to stop taking these meds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not looking for any advice on overall lifting plans, rather I'm looking for advice from people who may have gone through something similar and how they managed to get through this type of situation.

Surprisingly for me I finished it in first attempt on treadmill in 42 min.\nI kept at it for some weeks and bought it down to 34 mins.

Removed all the bread and rice but kept the proteins, increased veggie and included breakfast with oats. Roughly 120 to 150g  protein ever day. Including 70 gm from whey alone. Aiminig for a calories deficet of 400. I had 22 to 25 percent body fat last time i checked. So I aimed to get rid of excess. So far I have lost 1.5 kg in 3 weeks.

I did that because my body structure was linear and didn't have very little biceps. So I did it to improve my self image and fitness as the same time. \n\nThe feedback I get from friends and others is not to do both cardio and weightlifting at the same time since I am a beginner.

Everything went well but I was shocked by a few things. First off, how are some people able to put so much weight on their deadlift compared to their squat. In my weight class, I had the highest squat by 60lbs. When deadlift came around, a kid who squatted 365, opened with a 475 deadlift. I was shocked. Almost all of these people who have a high deadlift to squat ratio all lifted sumo. I did mine conventional and with pretty solid form. Should I take the time to learn and switch to sumo? It seems so much easier since these kids are able to jump 100+ pounds from squat to deadlift. Lastly, what can I do to improve my arch for bench. I would say I have pretty good bench form and I am able to maintain a decent arch, but there are kids who can get crazy arches and this results in them having very high benches for their bodyweight. Is there anything I can do to improve this? Any advice is appreciated.

Hope you are all having a wonderful Chinese new year for those who celebrate. As usual, I've collected a few interesting studies and wrote short summaries of them for all of you to read. All for educational purposes and to spark some discussion. The paper on sleep is not entirely related to fitness but it is health-related and I thought it would be interesting nonetheless.\n\nThe first study we will look at is a review written by Schoenfeld & Aragon (2018) and it asks the question: how much protein can muscles use for growth in one meal? This is actually a common question thrown around in the fitness world as a lot of people want to be as efficient as possible and want to maximize protein\u2019s effects on muscle growth in each meal. However, as odd as it sounds, sometimes the question is asked incorrectly. For the question above, some people will ask how much protein can be absorbed in one meal as opposed to how much can be used for muscle growth maximally. All protein will be absorbed but the real question is what happens to all of it afterwards.\n\nThe review highlights the study conducted by Areta et al. (2013) which is commonly cited to say that 20\u201325 grams of protein is the maximum number that muscles can use for hypertrophy (muscular growth). In this study, trained individuals were given different amounts of protein in a 12 hour period post-workout. Some were supplemented with 10 grams every 1.5 hours, some 20 grams every 3 hours and some 40 grams every 6 hours. In this experiment, the group that consumed 20 grams had the greatest rates of muscle protein synthesis (a fancy term to describe the building of muscles with protein). This would suggest that eating around 20 grams of protein at a time would be the best for building muscle. The biggest limitation that this review noted in the aforementioned study was that the total protein amounts used over the 12 hour period were quite low practically. Individuals training for hypertrophy would be consuming much greater amounts of protein overall.\n\nTo challenge the previous study, the review presents a paper done by Macnaughton et al. (2016) in which 40 grams of protein elicited greater muscle protein synthesis than 20 grams in the context of full body training. Another experiment carried out by Kim et al. (2016) found that 70g of beef protein showed a more significant anabolic response than 40g of beef protein. However, it should be noted that this response was measured as a whole body response and not just for muscle protein synthesis. Therefore, it is impossible to say which amount is better for muscle protein synthesis in the context of this study.\n\nFor women, Arnal et al. (1999, 2000) found that one meal with a large amount of protein was better than the same amount spread across several meals in regards to muscle retention. These results are interesting but a limitation to extrapolation is that no resistance training was taking place amongst the subjects.\n\nMuscle retention is also similar between those who follow intermittent fasting and those who diet continuously (Seimon et al., 2015). This would suggest that daily protein taken all at once would have the same effects on muscle as spreading out your protein intake across the day.\n\nIn the end, the authors of this review recommend 0.4\u20130.55 g/kg/meal which follows daily recommended intakes stated in a meta-analysis produced by Morton et al. (2017).\n\n**TL;DR:** It still is not clear what the optimum number of grams of protein per meal for maximizing muscular growth is but 0.4\u20130.55 g/kg/meal appears to be a safe recommendation based on the current literature.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nWe will now eat into a study done by Lee et al. (2018) in which differences between the conventional deadlift and the Romanian deadlift were investigated. For those who do not know what a Romanian deadlift is, it is essentially a normal deadlift starting from the top (barbell at waist) and then descending the barbell down until the hamstrings cannot stretch any further while not flexing at the lumbar spine. The knees cannot bend further than roughly 15 degrees. It may sound like a stiff-legged deadlift, however, in a stiff legged deadlift, you generally start from the bottom and your knees are allowed to bend more allowing you to bring the barbell to the floor. If you are referring to the straight-legged deadlift, the knees would not flex at all and the barbell would not drag along the legs in the descent.\n\nThe study recruited 21 males with at least 3 years of both conventional and Romanian deadlift experience with their training occurring at least twice a week. The first day involved 1 repetition maximum testing as this would facilitate selecting the appropriate load for the participants during the trial (subjects would be doing 5 reps of each lift at 70% of their 1 repetition maximum). To examine muscle activation, the scientists used electromyography. To put it simply, this is where electrodes are pasted over certain muscles to measure the electrical activity from the muscles.\n\nThe conventional deadlift showed more activation in the rectus femoris (a quadricep muscle, one that helps extend your knee and flex your hip) and slightly more activation in the gluteus maximus (your butt). Activation of the biceps femoris (a hamstring muscle) was similar between the two lifts which is interesting considering that many believe that the Romanian deadlift helps target the hamstrings better compared to the conventional deadlift.\n\nTorque (force produced about a joint) was much higher in the knee for the conventional deadlift which was probably expected considering the knee goes through a much larger range of motion. Similarly, the torque measured at the ankles were also higher in the conventional deadlifts which may suggest higher calf muscle activity though this was not measured in the study.\n\nSome important design aspects to note that affect generalizability is that we may see different results with different loads/intensities. Another issue regarding intensity is that the loads were selected according to the 1 repetition maximum of the subject\u2019s Romanian deadlift. Therefore, the conventional deadlift loads may not truly be 70% of their conventional deadlift 1 repetition maximum. It is safe to say that the intensities in this study were likely not matched. Finally, the hamstrings consist of several muscles but only one hamstring muscle was observed during the experiment.\n\n**TL;DR:** The conventional deadlift may be better at targetting the quadriceps and the gluteal muscles. Against what is commonly thought, the Romanian deadlift may not be better than the conventional deadlift at hitting the hamstrings, however, more comprehensive electromyography analysis should be done before making a solid statement.\n\nEDIT: As pointed out by u/bleearch, the Romanian deadlift may be beneficial for those who have knee problems as you get to enjoy the same hamstring activation while going through less knee torque.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nA large study conducted by Wild et al. (2018) explored the effects of duration of sleep on cognition. The team created a questionnaire which tested various human cognitive aspects like short-term memory, reasoning, spatial working and planning. However, the main areas that were being observed were short term memory, reasoning and verbal ability. At the same time, questions about sleep were asked to see the relationship between the person\u2019s sleep and their cognitive ability. The questionnaire was set up as an online survey in which they were able to gather 10,886 subjects.\n\nFirstly, it appears that as a person ages, their sleep duration decreases.\n\nAll areas of cognition were affected by sleep duration except for short term memory. This is likely because short term memory is a low-order cognitive process, it is not as complex as something like problem solving. Looking at the graphs below, we can clearly see an inverted-U for almost all cognitive areas which tells us that both too little and too much sleep has negative effects on cognition. Even when the authors thinned the analyzed subjects by removing extremes from both ends of the results, they still saw the inverted-U.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/NFHXzuV\n\nThe most optimal sleep duration for overall cognitive ability according to these results is 7.38 hours. Any duration over 8 hours likely has a negative effect on cognition and the authors were able to reliably find negative effects below 6.26 hours of sleep. It was also highlighted that even a single night of sleep had effects on cognition the next day. People who are chronically poor sleepers can benefit from just a single night of good quality sleep and the same vice-versa (good sleepers are affected by one bad night). Sleeping less than usual or sleeping 2.76 hours more than usual on one night showed negative effects for cognition on average.\n\nDespite sleep duration decreasing with age, the results showed that age has no effect on the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive ability. An interesting fact illustrated by this study is that if one were to sleep less than four hours in a night, you would experience a cognitive impairment that is the same as adding 8 years to your age (cognitive ability worsens with age).\n\nClear limitations of this study include the cross-sectional nature of the study (we are only looking at a snapshot of these people\u2019s lives, long term effects of sleep duration are not seen), the lack of people over 70 years old as well as children / adolescents and the fact that all these results were self-reported. Regarding the last point, the authors explain that the self-reporting still has moderate correlation with objective data.\n\n**TL;DR:** Getting 7 hours of sleep appears to be optimal for cognition. Sleeping any less or more shows some cognitive deficit. Even a one night\u2019s sleep can show acute effects on cognition.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nThe next study is a new meta-analysis done by Grgic et al. (2019) seeing whether or not the time of the day you do your training has an effect on muscle growth or strength. A meta analysis is where you pool the results of several studies together and is generally seen as the greatest form of scientific evidence. Previous research appears to be equivocal in regards to the effects of training time and muscle strength/growth with some studies showing a more positive effect in evening training and some presenting no difference at all between times.\n\nIn total, the authors collected 11 studies for analysis. At baseline, people were stronger in the evening which suggests that people are naturally stronger in the evening. The authors postulate that this could be due to increased body temperatures in the evening or perhaps some hormonal reason. People who trained in the morning had no difference between strength tests in the morning or evening. However, those who trained the evening were stronger than they were in the morning. This introduces a benefit to morning training as it will make you stronger throughout the entire day in contrast to evening training which would only make you stronger in the evening. In terms of muscle hypertrophy, no differences were found at all.\n\nUnfortunately, all of these studies used maximal voluntary contractions to measure strength instead of 1 repetition maximum tests. 1 repetition maximum tests are more practical because they test the strength of movements that you actually train in the gym. There are also not many studies looking at time of training and muscle hypertrophy thus presenting a gap in the literature. Finally, the studies were quite heterogeneous in terms of participants\u2019 ages.\n\n**TL;DR:** People seem to be stronger in the evening at baseline, however, unlike evening training, morning training will make you stronger throughout the entire day. Any conclusions regarding muscle growth is difficult to make due to the paucity of research on the subject though for now there appears to be no relationship.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nThe last paper we will look at was written by Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2017). Caffeine is a stimulant that is often consumed prior to training to boost muscular strength and endurance. Its effects are well documented and the research strongly supports caffeine as a valuable ergogenic aid (Grgic et al., 2018). The paper at hand investigated the effects of habitual caffeine intake on its efficacy during training. In other words, they ask if one were to consume caffeine regularly, would they build a tolerance to it and experience less of its benefits in training?\n\nThe most likely theory for the way caffeine works is that it binds to adenosine receptors in the body. Amongst many functions, adenosine can make one feel sleepy and even bring down the heart rate of the body. Now, the worries that caffeine may have a reduced effect with habitual intake stem from the process where caffeine use will cause the body to create more adenosine receptors which allows more adenosine to bind to its receptors.\n\nThe scientists recruited 40 male, trained cyclists to take part in the experiment. The study was designed in a crossover manner and in a double-blinded fashion. A crossover study means that all the participants got to try all treatments. In this case, every subject was supplemented with 6 mg/kg of caffeine for a week, was given a placebo for another week and was given nothing for another week. A double blind simply means that neither the scientists nor the subjects knew which treatment was being administered which helps reduce bias.\n\nThe cyclists were grouped according to their caffeine intake prior to being recruited into the study. The low intake group consumed 58 mg/day on average, the moderate intake group at 143 mg/day and the high intake group at 351 mg/day. To put these numbers into perspective, the high intake group is worth about 4.5 250ml cans of Red Bull in terms of caffeine.\n\nThe first day involved some simple body measurements as well as some testing to determine how much the cyclists needed to perform during real testing later on. The next couple of days consisted of familiarization with the time trial tests that the cyclists would have to do. The time trial basically required each cyclist to cycle a certain amount and then the time to completion would be measured. Caffeine 24 hours before the time trial was restricted and a 24 hour dietary recall before each test was also implemented to control caffeine intake. Subjects fasted 6 hours before each time trial and if they were being supplemented with 6 mg/kg of caffeine, it was done 1 hour before the time trial. Rate of perceived exertion was also measured throughout the trial.\n\nCyclists performed 2\u20133% better when on caffeine compared to placebo/control. There was no difference between placebo and control. Rate of perceived exertion was similar between all treatments.\n\nThe same trends were seen regardless of caffeine intake habits. That is to say, even they were in the high habitual intake group, the benefits from caffeine were the same.\n\nIt would appear that regardless of whether or not you consume a lot of caffeine, you can still reap all the ergogenic benefits of the stimulant. However, I am curious to see if we would see the same results in a strength training context. Also, it is worth noting that these results can only be generalized to males.\n\n**TL;DR:** Whether you use a lot of caffeine or not, you will not build a tolerance and not experience less benefits during training.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nAreta, J.

I\u2019ve always had a pretty good physique. Always have been able to see my abs. At my worst I could still see top abs. Last year I started to put work in to training and build some muscle the right way. I was probably 168 when I started. Finally followed somewhat of a routine and developed a decent back, shoulders, and leveled out things in the upper half of the body. But I never really took it past some hard pumps and a protein shake after. \n\n     Last month, I\u2019ve become very invested in diet. I\u2019ve finally got my macro nutrients in place but I may be taking it to the extreme... I\u2019ve been idolizing physique competition winners and their insane ripness. So I\u2019ve made it a goal to cut as much of the little body fat I have to get shredded. \n\n     My diet right now is about 1750 calories a day. A regular day of eating this last week has been 4 egg whites and 1 yoke in the first meal, 8oz chicken breast + roasted veggies + spinach for 2nd and 3rd meals, then a late night workout ending with a protein shake I do with a banana, peanut butter and milk. \n\n     This last week has been the most shredded I\u2019ve ever been in my whole life. I\u2019ve gone from 163 average to 160 when I go to bed. I\u2019m worried I might be losing muscle mass. So to counteract my body burning muscle, I try and work out as hard as I can. \n\n     Also wanted to mention this is the most energy I\u2019ve had in my whole life. I wait tables at a French restaurant and work late long hours. Usually I\u2019ll have over 5 cups of coffee and still feel drained all night. Since starting my heavy protein but very clean diet (which I try to eat in a 10 hour window as well) I haven\u2019t had a single cup of coffee at work. I\u2019ll usually just have one or two when I get up in the morning and I\u2019ll have energy the entire day. \n\n     Basically wondering if you guys think I should add more calories to maybe build a few more pounds of muscle but keep the diet low carb and I\u2019ll still be able to stay shredded. Or wait out my current diet and if I drop below 155, probably start adding back in more carbs to get back to a weight I\u2019m more comfortable at\n\n   Hope someone reads this.

I recently finished up running GZCLP for a while (which I loved and will definitely come back to one day).

I am going to start the main lifts with the option 4 progression which is a 3 week progression of 4x2 --> 5x2 --> 6x2 --> repeat with increased weight. Are only doing doubles for my main lift enough for progress? or would perhaps a different 3 week SetxRep scheme be better?\n3. Myo-Reps: It seems the man focus of this program is to increase mass through the auxiliary exercises. I read through Borge's [piece on Myo-reps](https://borgefagerli.com/myo-reps-in-english/) and really want to try them out. What are the best ways to use this rep scheme? Is it just one full set and done, or is it repeated multiple times in one workout?

I told her the truth, and she said that what I was doing was wrong. That using the machines would give me big, weird muscles, and not a nice form overall given that they only focus on one muscle at a time. That I needed to do cardio. She offered to plan something with me so I could go to her classes and then do more exercises to focus on the glutes. \n\nFirst, now I am super stressed about going to the gym on Monday because I don't really know what to do, I kinda agreed (without saying a word) with her helping me. I don't know how to decline (or agree???). And second, J really don't think (I honestly don't know) the classes will work. But she is a coach, she should know, right? Please help me, this conversation with her has left me completely lost on what to do next. \n\nEdit: Also, I have to add, the classes are actually really fun, they keep my heart rate up while doing squats, donkey kicks, abs, pretty much everything, but with max 10kg overall.

I know everybody says \u201cmuscle weighs more than fat,\u201d but there\u2019s people way more jacked than me and weigh less.\n\nFor insight, my eating habits are a bowl of special k and Protein shake in the morning, protein bar for a snack, sandwich and fruit from the grocery store, gym for 2-4 hours 3-5 days a week, another bar and shake, and a gallon of water throughout the day. Dinner is whatever\u2019s being cooked at home.\n\nEdit: here\u2019s some photos if that helps everyone\u2019s assessment\nhttps://imgur.com/a/x1Ra73F\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PVttq3T", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6938057, "post_title": "Scale vs eyeball test.

Last year I left my hometown to go to college and became real lazy and never went to the gym but have been meaning to get back in the swing of things. For the past 2 years I have been on the fencing team/club here at UTK and many others on the team have been wanting to start going to the gym as well to improve their fencing but most of them have never been to a gym and don't know how to do any movements, so I told them I'd help them. Now for fencing u use a lot of legs and core with alittle back and arm use. I think a mix of cardio and power lifting will be good so we can have explosive starts and be able to last long in day long tournaments. Sense I don't know much about cardio or power lifting I was hoping to get some help from here.\n\nActual question:  So I was thinking for legs box jumps, dead lifts and squats with low weight and high reps for arms I was thinking doing iron crosses and aronold presses.

About 100 lbs overweight and a total mess when it comes to cardiovascular fitness. \n\nStarted going to the gym about 5 weeks ago and I have gone 4-5 days per week every week. Every time I go to the gym, I do a treadmill workout and most days I do a whole-body strength training circuit at the eGym. \n\nTreadmill workouts vary...three days a week I do 30 min of cycling between walking and jogging \u2014progressing with more jogging and less walking each week. (Think c25K, but way slower...I am only increasing the amount of jogging by 15 sec each week.) One day a week I just walk briskly at a 2-3% incline for an hour. And one day a week I walk slowly at a steeper (6-12%) incline for 30 min. \n\nEgym workout is always the same 9 machines and I take a strength test every couple weeks so that the machines can adjust my training weight accordingly. \n\nI also signed up for myfitnesspal, having lost 40 lbs or so with that app in the past. I bought a Garmin and synced it up. I have stayed within my calorie budget almost everyday. Even on the days when I don\u2019t go to the gym, I usually end up with 7,000-10,000 steps from my daily life. \n\nThe results? \n\nSo far I am sore everyday, I haven\u2019t lost any weight, and I still can hear myself breathing when I climb stairs. I jog so slowly and yet I am basically never able to \u201ccarry on a conversation\u201d while I jog because in actuality it is hard for me to carry on a conversation even when I just walk briskly. \n\nI read an article about a guy who was 3XX lbs and trained for and ran a marathon within one year. When he ran the marathon he was fit and toned, even though he started by just walking one mile a day. I had tried to be reasonable and set my sights on a 5K 8 months from now and I am starting to have trouble believing I will ever get there. How did this guy run a marathon in a year and I am such a mess? \n\nI am female, 34 years old with 2 kids, 5\u20194\u201d and 240 lbs. \n\n\nTL;DR: Am I doing what I am supposed to be doing? If so, when will I start to feel better?\n\nUPDATE: Wow! I didn\u2019t expect such a big response. Thank you to everyone! \n\nJust a couple notes because there are some things that have come up in quite a few of the comments: \n\n1. You needn\u2019t  worry about me hating my workouts. I actually love my workouts and crave my gym time. So that is definitely not an issue. A lot of folks mentioned doing something different so that it wasn\u2019t something that I hated and I just wanted to clear it up that I don\u2019t at all hate what I am doing\u2014 I just want to make sure I am doing this the right way and being productive and safe. \n\n2. A lot of people mentioned calories in drinks. Never fear, I am super well-aware of that! \n\n3. It definitely sounds like I shouldn\u2019t be eating the calories that MFP adds to my calorie bank from my Garmin. Message received. I\u2019m just bummed because when I did this before I lost 2 lbs per week like clockwork even though I ate all the extra calories I got from my Fitbit \u2014 it was a great motivator to move more so that I could go out with friends or whatnot. \nI  am going to play with my settings a little before totally giving up on dipping into those \u201cbonus\u201d calories. Today I turned off the continuous heart rate monitoring and the Garmin only gave me 184 extra calories instead of like 1,500! So maybe that is the difference between now and a couple years ago when I did this with my Fitbit (which did not have heart rate monitoring). \n\n4. I am still super confused about the intensity I should be aiming for...why do some people say that you should push yourself as hard as you can go and others say to keep your intensity to a conversational level?\n\n5. Thanks to everyone who is recommending particular diets/fasts, but I really need to avoid any diets that are very restrictive as far as particular types of food groups. I can cut down on carbs, but I am not able to eliminate them or anything. I tried that a few years ago and it was not good for me. I have low blood pressure and generally low blood sugar, so I am super susceptible to fainting spells and have noticed that that gets worse if I don\u2019t have a balance of protein, carbs and fat with every meal. Fasting would definitely be a bad idea for me.

This comes with a gym included that more or less has all the equipment I need to complete my workouts, so I don't wish to pay membership for a dedicated gym until I finish the class.\n\nThe main problem in this otherwise ordinary situation is that the gym staff is hyper-sensitive to any sound made from weights contacting the floor. \n\nAs an example: During deadlifts, I was lowering the weight reasonably slow because the floor doesn't have any protective mats and I didn't want to scuff the tile. Maybe 30 seconds later, the old dude at the front desk charges over and demands that I stop dropping the weights. He said this in the angry, condescending old-man voice (don't know if that's familiar to anyone) so I was a bit miffed.\n\nAnyway, I now have to put specific effort in very lightly placing the bar on the ground whenever I do a \"from the ground\" movement. I would like tips on how to safely and effectively deal with this. When I searched the topic, the consensus seemed like you can hurt yourself if you lower the bar very slow during deadlifts.\n\nI do the following 3 lifts from the ground:\n\n* barbell rows \n* deadlifts\n* sumo deadlifts\n\nI thought to ask because I got a kind of strain sensation in my back using this method last time I needed to do sumo deadlifts. No actual injury ended up arising from it, but I'm cautious.\n\nReally appreciate some tips! Thanks everyone.\n\nEDIT: Calling the floor \"tile\" was a mistake on my end. It's that blue gym floor material that's very slightly \"gummy\". There are no distinct tiles or anything and it doesn't seem like it would crack as a failure mode.

So whenever I do, for example, leg raises or reverse crunches while sitting, my back is working hard, it becomes quite exhausted after, lets say, 10-15reps of reverse crunches and my lower abs aren't feeling any workout at all.   \n\n\nHow do I deal with this issue?

I don't really eat a lot of healthy food and I don't eat a lot. I usually eat 2-3 times a day (when I'm in school I usually eat a ham sandwich with some vegetables or chicken burger with vegetables, usually tomatoes and cabbage). When I'm home I usually eat, well, sometimes cooked food but more often than not a sandwich, grilled meat or a pizza here and there.\n\nI try to eat as much vegetables I can but I only eat fresh vegetables (mostly tomatoes, cabbage, lettuce, cucumber, carrots). I dislike onions, garlic, broccoli, spinach, peas, and other vegetables like those.\n\nI love eating all kinds of fruits, especially oranges, apples, pears, bananas, pineapples, etc.\n\nI don't eat a lot of sugar, although I like eating chocolate and pancakes with nutella :p\n\nI rarely drink tap water, mostly fruit juices and sodas. Should I drink more tap water instead?\n\nA problem I've run into is that my arms can't follow my chest. My absolutely favorite exercise is Inclined Machine Press because it really hits me in the higher chest area and I can really feel it & I really like the feeling.\n\nBut here's the problem: I've been doing it for some time with 10 kilos in each hand, then started slowly with 15 kilos, and now I'm doing it with 20 kilos, but I don't feel anything in the chest area anymore. Which means I should do it with a higher weight, right? Well, the problem is that my arms can't handle more weight.

I\u2019ve always been strong and flexible in the sense that I perform well in sports & daily activities. I\u2019ve started going to the gym in the past year, focusing seriously on proper form, and I have more injuries than ever before. \n\nNow in the morning when I wake up and stretch in bed, I almost always get a terrible neck pinch or some back twinge. \n\nI\u2019m considering dropping weight training because of this. But maybe its all coincidence? I\u2019m hoping to hear more on the subject or even find some relevant studies. \n\nEdit: I\u2019m reading the comments here and a lot of people are mentioning that it must be bad form, which I genuinely believe isn\u2019t the case. But a few people have pointed out that it could be the actual volume or weight and lack of traditional deadlifts.\n\nI\u2019ve never had much instruction on how to do deadlifts and avoided it in order to not hurt myself but that might be doing more harm than good. Additionally I try to lift to failure on all exercises and genuinely push myself each time. \u201cIf its not hard, you\u2019re not getting better, right?\u201d\n\nSo then that leads me to ask, are there types of weight training that inevitably lead to injury, while other types prevent it?", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6938056, "post_title": "Is injury more likely to be caused by weakness or strength when weight training?", "post_ups": 0, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/an4s9f/is_injury_more_likely_to_be_caused_by_weakness_or/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-15 22:01:28.995582", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "purplespengler", "post_created_utc": 1549305286.0, "post_distinguished": "moderator", "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1549331457.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "an4oji", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 139, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 886, "post_selftext": "Howdy everyone. As you know, the Wiki has been an integral part of r/Fitness for a long time and we are constantly looking for ways to improve it as a resource. It's for this reason that we are retiring the r/Fitness Wiki on Reddit completely and moving it to a separate site built with WordPress.\n\nToday we're excited to announce the launch of https://thefitness.wiki as the new Wiki for r/Fitness.\n\nWe have several reasons for doing this:\n\n1. The Reddit Wiki system has always been kind of generally simplistic and featureless and offers us almost zero control over anything about it. If you've never pulled up the FAQ on a phone under old Reddit, give it a try and see how terrible it looks. I've personally wanted to do this for a *very* long time just for that reason.\n2. The Reddit mobile app and site do not play well with Reddit Wikis. They regularly show Page Not Found errors, leading people to think the Wiki is broken, and there's nothing we can do about it. This is a really shitty experience for anyone on mobile, which is around 2/3rds of the traffic r/Fitness gets.\n3. Using a platform with a rich array of built in functionality and available plugins gives us significantly more flexibility in terms of features that we can put into it to make it easier to use, navigate, and get information out of. The ability to actually search the Wiki is a great example of the dumbest, most basic functionality that we haven't had for ten years of r/Fitness. It also gives us the opportunity (because I am a programmer) to add our own functionality (Ex: I hope to add a search for r/Fitness itself that isn't the dumpster fire Reddit Search currently is)\n4. We don't have to rely on or be at the mercy of what Reddit decides to implement, on what timeline, and with what level of quality.\n\nThis is a first pass. Our priority here was getting the content we have in the current Wiki moved over and cleaned up. But we're far from done. We're very much aware that moving the Wiki off of Reddit has the potential to make it lose some of the feeling of being a product of the community. To help with that, we're going to be looking to add links to relevant discussion threads in as many sections and FAQ answers as possible. This is something we'll need help with, so if you have some great threads in your pocket, let us know where they can be linked to. We're also collaborating with r/weightroom to build a conjoined Wiki that can serve both subreddits and be a resource for trainees of all experience levels.\n\nWe've put a lot of work into this and we hope you all like it. This will be a transition week as we update links in the  sidebar and comment templates. Reddit doesn't recognize the \".wiki\" extension as a valid domain suffix, so be sure to remember to put the https:// before if you link to it. \n\nPlease ask any questions you have and leave any feedback in this thread.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6938056, "post_title": "Important Announcement About the r/Fitness Wiki", "post_ups": 886, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/an4oji/important_announcement_about_the_rfitness_wiki/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-15 22:01:28.995582", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "JohnnyTest7", "post_created_utc": 1549304552.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "an4jmv", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 5, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 0, "post_selftext": "Whenever I\u2019m doing weights I feel like I\u2019m not using correct technique and damaging my body in the long run.

I am a complete and utter beginner when it comes to working out and fitness in general (and also new to this sub so if this type of post is frowned upon or not allowed, I apologize). I've been working out 3 times a week since the end of October 2018. My friends are experienced gym rats and set me up with a program for building muscle/increasing strength and gave me some loose dietary rules to follow (eat sizeable portions, eat a lot of protein, etc). I guess you could call what I've been doing bulking (maybe?), but I've reached a point now where I would like to start losing weight since I have quite the gut that I want to get rid of. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a few questions on the subject:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Is it too soon for me to start losing weight/\"cutting\"? - I've only been working out for about 3 months and I'm far from muscular or anything. Should I keep bulking or is it okay for me to re-orient towards losing weight for a while?\n\n2. Is cutting out carbs entirely a dumb thing to do? - I understand that periods of weight loss can be real tough. Cutting out carbs entirely and trying to eat an appropriate amount of protein per day seems like a simple way of handling my diet, but is it ill-advised? I would like to keep the muscle gains I've made in these months, even though I understand I won't keep growing. \n\n3. What are the best ways of minimizing muscle loss? - From what I understand, carrying on with weight training and eating a good amount of protein is the best way of minimizing muscle loss while losing weight, but is there anything else I should keep in mind?\n\n4. How long can I do this for? - Obviously, it's impossible for you to know how much fat I need to lose to get rid of my love handles and to get a flat stomach, but is there a time frame I'm looking at? Is there a limit to how long I can keep this going without adverse effects to my health or fitness-level? \n\nI'm sure the answers to these questions are already out there, but  the wealth of information is kind of overwhelming, and I would really appreciate some answers from people experienced in this subject, or some help in finding good resources where my questions might already be answered. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!

The past 2 weeks I started boxing for the first time in my life and want to know how can I combine it with working out at the gym to achieve my goals.\n\n**Background**: 35 male, 185cm / 6\u20191, 85kg / 187lbs, around 14.5-15% bodyfat.\n\nUp until the end of November I was at a caloric deficit and I\u2019ve lost around 30kg / 66lbs over the past 15 months. For the last two months I took a break from dieting and now I want to continue and lose a bit more weight, I guess in to put in in numbers I will be happy at around 11-12% bodyfat.\n\nOn July I stepped foot in a gym for the 1st time in my life and since September I had a steady program and I didn\u2019t miss a day besides taking a week-long break twice to rest. My routine was something like this:\n\n* day 1: Legs 6 exercises, shoulders 4 exercises\n* day 2: Chest 6 exercises, biceps 4 exercises\n* day 3: Back 6 exercises, triceps 4 exercises plus core work every day.\n* day 4: rest\n* day 5: Legs, shoulders and repeat, which is 5 or 6 days per week.\nEach exercise was 4x12 same weights.\n\n**Goals**: First goal is to get leaner and that is down to nutrition so I kinda know what to do in that area. In terms of strength I really don\u2019t care, I\u2019m not interested (yet) in being able to lift an arbitrary number on the bench etc. What I do want is to get a little bit bigger in terms of muscle mass, not BIG but a bit bigger, and I realize that it won\u2019t happen anytime soon since I\u2019m at a caloric deficit but sometime in the future.\n\nMy boxing training program is 4 days per week and a typical session looks something like this: 15 minutes warmup, 45 technical work, 10-15 minutes work. The working out part is mostly light dumbells and bodyweight work that involves mainly many different muscle groups each day, many reps with like 10 seconds rest in between muscle group. I guess its aimed more at stamina/endurance and not strength.\n\n**Question**\n\nSo, to elaborate my question, how can I complement what I do at boxing with going at the gym. Maybe I\u2019m overthinking it, but I am a bit confused because I asked around about what I should do and I got varying responses. How many times should go at the gym, should it be on the same day as boxing practice and what kind of workout program should I follow.\n\nFortunately for the time being I have no time constraints, I can plan my time around my fitness plans so I want to know how I can get as much advantage I can without the risk of \u201covertraining\u201d etc. \n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6938056, "post_title": "Been working out for 6 months and just picked up boxing.

My bodyweight was around 90kg / 200 lbs but at some point my Achilles tendon couldn't really handle my running volume anymore. After some time I gave up on training properly and got fat (again) once stopped doing cardio 5-6 times a week AND ate even less disciplined.\n\n\nSo when I got into lifting my primary goal was/is to not be as fat and shape up. For some reason I have an easier time sticking to a decent diet whilst I'm working towards an (exercise) goal, so coupled with the exercise I also started to track my calories.\n\nAccording to most calcs my TDEE was estimated to be around 2800kcal. Since I felt that was kinda high I opted to aim for about 2100kcal while hitting 180g+ Protein. During the intial 2 months I hit 1800 on average, since I was super motivated, twas summer etc.\n\nI've since started using Nsuns tracker, which shows my TDEE to be about 2700.\n\n\nI've been lifting for about 6 months now (complete beginner, a 2 month stint at the gym bout 4 years ago aside). I started doing SL 5x5 in July and kept at it for about 2 Months before a minor injury followed by a one week holiday and being sick for 2 weeks kept me from constantly lifting for roughly 1,5 months.\n\n\n\n\n**Starting Lifts:**\n\n\n* Squat: 5x5 30 kg / 66 lbs\n* Bench: 5x5 40 kg / 88 lbs\n* Deadlift 1x5 60 kg / 132 lbs\n* OHP: 5x5 20 kg / 44 lbs\n\n* Bodyweight: 118kg / 260 lbs\n\n**Lifts before the break:**\n\n* Squat: 5x5 75 kg / 165 lbs\n* Bench: 5x5 60 kg / 133 lbs\n* Deadlift 1x5 95 kg / 210 lbs\n* OHP: 5x5 37,5 kg / 82 lbs\n\n* Bodyweight: 105kg / 230 lbs\n\n\nI got back into the groove in mid October, this time opting to go with lvysaurs 4-4-8, based on the things I had read during my hiatus (and honestly, mainly since I feel I need to build a massive chest to make up for my moobs, see progress pics )\n\n\n**Starting Lifts after the break:**\n\n* Squat: 4x4 50 kg / 110 lbs\n* Bench: 4x4 60 kg / 133 lbs\n* Deadlift 4x4 80 kg / 176 lbs\n* OHP: 4x4 32,5 kg / 72 lbs\n\n* Bodyweight: 111kg / 244 lbs\n\n\n**Current Lifts:**\n\n* Squat: 4x4 105 kg / 230 lbs\n* Bench: 4x4 85 kg / 186 lbs\n* Deadlift 4x4 140 kg / 310 lbs\n* OHP: 4x4 50kg / 110 lbs\n\n* Bodyweight: 107kg / 235 lbs\n\n\n[Progress pic](https://imgur.com/a/QVarxJn)\n\n\n\n**Questions** \n\nMy Bench and OHP have basically stalled despite deloading twice and incorporating triceps isolations. I have to admit, I haven't done much reading, but from what I gathered, most people stall out at higher weights. Is that because they are younger / genetics? Is it due to the caloric deficit? I usually feel like I'm eating enough and feel full, sleep 8hrs, hit at least 180g Protein per day etc. However, the workouts (especially stuff like 4x8 Deadlifts) leave me feeling unable to do much aside from lying on the coach or take a 1-2h nap after.\n\n\nI'm still progressing on my lower body lifts. So should I ride the beginner progressive overload for a bit longer? And, since my main goal is to look decent, instead of switching to a new programme and having to incorporate 2 more workout days (e.g. in a PPL), focus on getting a 45min swim and run in each week?\n\n\nI saw u/lvysaur recommend swapping to his [aesthetic routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/lvysaur/comments/65fuxu/lvysaurs_intermediate_aesthetic_routine_5_days/) or a different intermediate programme once 2 lifts stall. His (or PPL) is probably the programme I'd go with, since I'm really happy with his 3 day beginner routine.\nI'm not looking for the quickest fix, but for the most beneficial long term path. Although I'm sure both ways would mean progress towards my goal, I'm still interested in your take on it.\n\n\n\n\n**tl; dr: fat beginner on caloric deficit stalling on upper body lifts: Continue with beginner programme and add 2 cardio days or transition to intermediate programme?**\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6938056, "post_title": "Beginning to stall on Lvysaurs 4-4-8 - where to go next", "post_ups": 101, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/amee5u/beginning_to_stall_on_lvysaurs_448_where_to_go/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-15 22:01:30.476710", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "RunicRaccoon", "post_created_utc": 1549116761.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "amedxs", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 64, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 43, "post_selftext": "Hey guys!

I'm having some workout scheduling problems. I'm a uni student who works and also tries to do BJJ up to 2x a week, so I only have 3 days a week to workout now, and I do so in the morning. My goals are to lose fat (I'm 230lbs, 20, a woman, 5'8. Goal is 170lbs... I think) but also to gain a lot of muscle, and I love lifting. I've been doing lifting for 2ish years now, BJJ for a few months.\n\n\nAt the beginning of the year, I created a program using one of exrx's templates:\n\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uHZKxEUqsX8rT-P-g88oermGMyKIqGdj28qBI5eHZj0/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\ntldr; ( in lbs)\n\nDeadlift 75% x 5 for 5 sets\n\nStiff leg deadlift 135 x 10 for 3 sets\n\nBent over row 115 x 10 for 3 sets\n\nUpright row 95 x 10 for 3 sets\n\nStanding Calf Raise 205 x 30\n\nOverhead Press 65 x 10 for 3 sets\n\nBarbell Bicep Curl (don't shoot me) 55 x 10 for 3 sets\n\nSquat 200 x 10 for 3 sets\n\nBench Press 135 x 3 for 5 sets \n\nClose Grip Bench Press 75 x 10 for 3 sets\n\n\n\nThen on different days I'll switch the position of Squats/Bench Press/Deadlift depending on what I want to work on more (ex. , on Wednesdays I'll do Bench Press for 75% x 5 for 5 instead of Deadlifts)\n\n\nI pulled around 30,000lbs in volume per workout 3 times a week, totalling 90000. I was able to hit a lot of new PRs, and it's actually pretty fun since I can do my entire workout on/near a squat rack and deadlift platform. But this workout left me really tired, took up about an hour of my time, and I don't know if it was healthy for me to be doing all the major lifts on each day. Also, on 2 days I do BJJ in the evenings after school and after this workout, which leaves me pooped and I'm concerned that I'm overtrainning with this.\n\n\nSo for the last week because of my concerns, I switched to doing 5/3/1, because I heard it was good for my goals. I used the Black Iron Beast calculator online to get this:\n\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1cqUf-5j1UI8CmVafH49SBswQLmnFq4iy/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ntl;dr Full Body Full Training (3 days a week)\n\n\nDeFranco's Warm up\n\nDay 1: Squat (I think it's a 5/3/1 progression), dumbbell Bench Press, Dumbbell row\n\nDay 2: Squat, Bench Press, Pull Ups\n\nDay 3: Squat, Press, Deadlift\n\n\nThen, I added battle rope training. The good is that I've already hit some new PRs on my major lifts (yes after just one week, idk how), I feel more 'work' done in each area, and I'm in and out of the gym in about 40-50 minutes. It also hurts less for me to walk around after and I feel more energized. But my trainning volume has dropped dramatically. I went from 90,000 a week to 55,000, and I don't know if this is going to mess up my 'gainz' (although i have so much fat I can barely see it anyways) or if this is bad for building muscle.\n\n\nAny pointers?

With that, I've cut down on my lifting and gone from a 4 day split to a very basic upper and lower body routine:\n\nUpper - flat bb bench, seated shoulder bb press, bent over bb row, weighted dips, pull ups\n\nLower - sumo deadlift, bb squat, calf raises, abs, shrugs\n\nI've switched more to a 5x5 routine.  My upper body used to be my strength, and I was last year maxing out at 235lbs bench, 175 shoulder press.  Now, I can hardly get past 195lbs bench, and my form is shit.  From a previous shoulder injury, baseline, my bench usually stops about an inch above my chest, but at 195 I'm half repping in the last one to two reps.  I've been unable to move up in bench for at least a month.  Other points, I work a job that is frequently 60-80 irregular hours a week, and my nutrition has not been fantastic as of recently.  I try and get 7-8 hours a sleep nightly.  \n\nDo you guys have any recs?  Is 5x5 not right for right now?  I've been lifting for 10 years but obviously I have been intermittent in my intensity.  I'm also getting older, so maybe that's a role as well.  Anyways, any critiques, comments, support would be most welcome as I'm fairly frustrated at this point.\n\n&#x200B;", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6938056, "post_title": "Stagnant in my workout", "post_ups": 1, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/amad6c/stagnant_in_my_workout/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-15 22:01:30.476710", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "joujou1999", "post_created_utc": 1549072699.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "am9ide", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 11, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 12, "post_selftext": "Can barely do these, my core shakes after 15 seconds.

What surprises me is the amount of volume 5 3 1 got; 5/3/1 routine, + FSL 5X5 at the end of each main lift, + 3 accessory lift ( Doing 25 dips/pull ups/ chinups is even harder than the main lifts for the moment).

I'm a female, 26, 4'11, 130lbs, runner, climber, soccer player, and occasional hiker. I just can't get my weight down. I used to fluctuate between 120-125 (which I didn't love) but for the last two years, I've been fluctuating between 125-130 and usually I'm closer to 130.\n\nI do have a sugar problem that I'm actively trying to control but I have a really hard time eating at a deficit because I'm just so freaking hungry if I try to keep it to 1200 calories/day. I usually end up eating somewhere between 1400-1600 and I either gain or maintain. The only time I lose any weight, and still not to my desired range, is when I exercise more - which I simply can't do all the time as I've already got a fairly steady gym 3 days/week schedule (2-3 hours/session). My current schedule is the max I can fit in with working full time/grad school part time.\n\nI'm healthy and relatively muscular, I'm probably 25% body fat, definitely not overweight despite BMI saying I'm borderline obese. My BMR is probably around 1300.\n\nI've been wanting to go down to 115-120lbs for a very long time so I can climb harder but I've been unable to eat at a deficit for any decent period of time.\n\nBreakfast is usually fiber one toast with butter or plain greek yogurt and fruit, lunch is some kind of salad with minimal dressing, I snack on fruit, and dinner is either salad or meat with veggies. I try not to keep sugary things (my one indulgence is cool whip and frozen fruit) at home but if someone brings cookies to work, I'm gonna eat some.\n\nShort people - how do you do it? Any meal suggestions?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone for taking the time to provide me with your advice and insight. I definitely have some homework to do! Hopefully the next time I post, it will be a progress update on how I actually followed through on the advice people gave and am seeing results :p\n\nEdit 2: My \"gym\" sessions are climbing sessions at the rock gym. I'm not lifting weights for 9 hours/week, just lifting my body. I don't spend 2-3 hours straight climbing, I take turns belaying my partner so there are rests built in. If it's relevant to anyone on here - I lead 5.10-5.11-, TR 5.10-5.12-, and boulder v4-v7. I also do treadwall sessions once a week at maximum incline for 10 minutes. I usually run an average of 9 miles/week outdoors (sometimes much more, sometimes a bit less) but if the weather sucks, then some of my time in the gym is spent running. I play soccer 1X/week.\n\nEdit 3: For all the people confused about how I believe I'm not overweight despite my BMI being in the overweight/obese range - I can post photos later but my measurements are chest: 28, waist: 26, hips: 37. I wear size 0-2 in dresses and size 2 in pants. Muscle weighs more then fat, I'm very muscular. I also have some fat I'd like to get rid of, which is why I posted in the first place. I have no way of measuring body fat, I'm just estimating I'm at around 25%. I look better at 130 now then I did 6 months ago at 130. Weight is not my primary concern, bf% is but since I'm unable measure bf%  weight is all I have to go off of.  I need to change what/how I eat. Most of y'all have been immensely helpful in providing suggestions how to change what/how I eat so once again - thanks!\n\nEdit 4: Here are some photos so y'all can see that although I weigh a lot for someone so short, I am not overweight. It is possible for people to have high BMIs and not be overweight.

Recently I switched my workout, from lower reps to higher reps with less weight, and some different exercises. The issue is with 2 exercises: Dips and lower back extensions.  \nCurrently, I do dips on my chest day, as last exercises. same as before. Previously I did Barbell rows>Bench Press>Dips>Skullcrushers. On my new workout I do Bench press>Incline DB Press, pec fly>Dips.  \nPreviously I was able to use 20kg added weight and push out 8-10 reps with dips, with this new rotation I was struggling with 10kg to get the same results. I fail to understand why, and am wondering whether I should do dips last, or earlier on.  \nThe issue with the lower back extensions is simply that they hurt insanely the day after. Never had issues with deadlifts, or the rest of the exercises, but doing bodyweight back extensions seems to be too much. I'm sure I do them right, but now am wondering if the workout for back is heavy enough without the back extensions, and better to be left out.  \nCurrent rotation: DB rows>Deadlift>Lat pulldowns>Seated rows>Australian pull ups>lower back extensions.\n2. Second question is whether my progress is good enough, and whether I should look at progression in weight, or in % of bodyweight. I feel like bench press is going way too slow. Last July/August I was benching 5x5 62,5kg. Current date, as seen above, I do 5x5 80kg. (although I switched yesterday to a workout schedule focussing on reps, with 4x10 on most exercises, so currently lowered the weight).  \n\n3. And lastly, judging from my max weights readable above, where should I shift my focus on? What is too low compared what I do on the other exercises? I'm asking because I think that the reason of my slow progress on bench press is caused by another muscle group which is too weak and is supporting while doing bench presses.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6938056, "post_title": "New Workout Issue or not?

The results said I had a 20.1% body fat. When I did the calculation based off of the US Navy method (using tape measurements), it said my body fat was roughly 18.3%\n\nSo just a few days ago, I did the scan again (because I received a free voucher that expires at the end of the month), and it said that my body fat actually went up to 20.4%, while my skeletal muscle mass stayed the same. Earlier that day, I used the tape measurement method and my numbers came up to roughly 17.3%\n\nWhat I don't get, is that I've been eating the same amount of food that I normally have been eating since before I started going back to the gym (which was at the start of December). Prior to going to the gym, my weight would more or less remain the same (it fluctuated within the 3 lbs range despite not working out).\n\nEver since I started going to the gym back in December, I've been doing 2 days of HIIT and 2 days of interval running a week, along with lifting weights roughly 6 days a week for roughly 1.5 hours. \n\nAnd ever since the past month, my arms and legs appeared to have gained a noticeable muscle mass, and my abs (while not being a six pack) have become more visible. My working set (with proper form) for bench press went up from 95 to 155lb, deadlift went up from 95 to 225lb, and squat went up from 85 to 205lb. \n\nBy the tape measurement (US Navy) method, I went from 18.3% to 17.3% in a month. According to the body composition scan machine at the Gold's Gym, I went from 20.1 to 20.4% body fat in a month. \n\nI personally don't agree with the body composition scan results I got from the gym. The guy who administered the scan said exactly what the other guy who did my original scan said. Both seemed to be a bit condescending about fitness to me (literally preaching to the choir with everything they were saying to me). It seemed more like a ploy to get me to sign up for a personal trainer at the Gold's Gym. \n\nDoes it make any sense for me to get considerably stronger and fatter, despite not adding any extra muscle mass and doing high-intensity cardio every week (according to the scan)? The guy claimed it was my muscle memory that was letting me lift heavier, rather than actual muscle gain. At my peak 3 years ago, I maxed out at 185 lb for bench and about 265 for deadlift. I only did 135 for squats (I didn't start on those until about 2 months before I stopped working out).\n\nBefore anyone else starts explaining to me about dirty bulk, clean bulk, cutting, calorie deficit, calorie surplus, macros, HIIT, SSC, IBUR, LISS, or any of the other workout lingo, I already understand the concept of all that. \n\n\ntl;dr: What's more reliable, a body composition scan machine showing an increase in body fat and zero change to muscle mass, or a mirror + tape measurement showing a decrease in body fat and increase in muscle mass.\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6938056, "post_title": "Long story-filled question regarding body composition scanners", "post_ups": 0, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/alzhuz/long_storyfilled_question_regarding_body/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-15 22:01:30.476710", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "SchizophrenicSnail", "post_created_utc": 1549000973.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "alz1el", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 6, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 8, "post_selftext": "I recently started the PHUL routine, and compared to the PPL, I feel like it is giving me less of a workout.

For most of my life I was morbidly obese. Lost the weight through diet, maintained that for about a year, and now have started focusing on body composition. Over the past 6 months, I worked my ass off in the gym because I love it (all lifting). I know the old adage is that women can't gain like guys do because we don't have the testosterone for it, but that really has not been my experience. Below you'll find my current physique (holiday fluff included) and an old comparison picture showing 3 months of arm growth:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/E1s8J0k\n\nRegardless of any one else's thoughts, I feel like I'm getting a more masculine-looking body (especially upper body) than I'd like to have. The problem is that lifting is my activity of choice, especially in the winter when I can't be outside. It's awesome for my mental health, I love the challenge, and I'm good at it. I also have very severe asthma, so HIIT and any steady state cardio that isn't boring as hell, is pretty excruciating (excuse or not, fitness is a form of self love for me and I don't want to do things I hate). I'm an easy gainer, both of muscle and fat, but a strong, lean, feminine look is what I'm going for.\n\nDiet: I obviously have some more fat I'd like to lose, and I've pared back my diet so that that's on track (high protein, lots of fresh and whole foods. 154p, 115c, 51f). I have eaten at a deficit throughout all of the building except the holidays. I thought maybe I was gaining so quickly because of the high protein, so  i backed off on  that, but when I upped my carbs to compensate, I was hungrier and started leaning towards \"skinny fat\" territory. \n\nTraining: I used to train 6x a week, 2 hours a day, increasing every time. Obviously when my diet was on point, that's a recipe for hypertrophy and I grew (faster than girls \"should,\" apparently. Constantly getting accused of juicing lol). My joints hurt and I was having trouble with recovery, so I switched it up. I cut back on training and started lifting much heavier for fewer sets, but it was during the holidays when I wasn't counting macros and may have been in surplus - another recipe for growth. CURRENTLY, I'm at a caloric deficit, doing short intense lifts (30-40 minutes of full-body lifting in circuits, no rest) in the 3-5 sets/exercise range, 4x a week. \n\nQuestions I have: Would I benefits more from returning to my old split and just doing less weight or fewer sets? It's possible to keep gaining strength without growth, correct? Is my ONLY HOPE cardio? What advice do you have for me or what haven't I considered?\n\nTl;Dr:  I'd like to maintain my upper body (though I honestly won't be sad if I shrink a little) without continuing to gain, and while trimming down a skosh. I want to keep lifting as my primary fit activity because it makes me happy. I eat a high protein diet at a caloric deficit, and right now I'm training full body 4x a week in the low-ish sets range.  Am I doing this shit right? Am I a genetic anomaly?

I\u2019ve been a starter on the v team since sophomore year as a lineman so the goal has always been to gain the most weight and strength as possible. Freshmen year I was around 190 pounds and now I\u2019m about 240 pounds at 6\u20193. \n\nMy focus has always been to eat as much as I can (healthy foods in a realistic quantity) in order to be a better football player. However now that I\u2019m about to enter my last season I realize I want to get down to maybe 210 and actually start looking \u2018Good\u2019. Because right now even at 6\u20193 I\u2019d say my body fat % is pretty high. Closer to 30 than anything else. \n\nI just wanted to know how crazy the strength loss will be after I cut 30 pounds? For a 17 year old I think I\u2019m decently strong, and I\u2019m super proud of the numbers I\u2019ve been able to hit but I\u2019m afraid if I cut all that weight in a short amount of time I\u2019ll be brought back to lifting weight I did as a sophomore/junior. \n\n\nThank you so much for any type of help and advice and apologies for any grammar errors.

I had always been a pretty fit guy and always active until my children came into this world. Working full time and being a father took a lot of time and motivation to stay fit away from me. At my peak fitness level I weighed around 190-195. I started realizing how crappy I was starting to look and feel and when I saw my weight at 216 I was kind of shocked and I committed to getting back down to around 195 and just getting into an overall healthy and fit state.\n\nI have never actually been in the business of trying to lose weight, as I had never been unhealthy and overweight. The first week of January I started eating a lot better and I bought a pair of Bowflex Selecttech 552 dumbbells and a bench. I am not on any specific diet, just committed to eating a lot healthier and cutting out all the soda, beer, sugar, fast food etc. I have been lifting weights and doing core exercises about 6 days a week and stacking cardio on top of it about 2 days a week. I have a whey protein shake after every workout. In 12 days I had lost 11 pounds and was down to 205 and was looking a lot leaner and more toned so I was pretty happy about that and kind of shocked at how quick and easy it was for me. However, the last week I seem to have put on a few more pounds and I don't seem to be losing anymore fat around my midesection where I have been holding most of my weight. I understand since I have been lifting weights quite a bit that I am going to put on some muscle weight. I guess my question is should I be lifting a little less, say 4 or 5 days a week and adding more cardio to my routine in order to burn that excess fat or should I stick with what I am doing? Is it common to lose weight that quickly and then kind of level off?\n\nI am not overly concerned about what the number on the scale says, just trying to burn off the excess fat and build a more lean, athletic, and toned body. \n\nLike I said before I have never actually had to try to lose weight so this is a first for me and any advice would be appreciated.\n\nEdit: I'm 6' tall.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6938056, "post_title": "Advice about my goals and my routine", "post_ups": 1, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/akwntw/advice_about_my_goals_and_my_routine/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-15 22:01:31.913808", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "braunasaur", "post_created_utc": 1548736940.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "akwhjd", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 3, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1, "post_selftext": "Hello, I'm a female in graduate school and trying to fight all the anxiety that comes with college through working out and eating healthy.

I was really happy to see myself burn off my overweight body and max out higher. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m 19 now and going to college mostly online and go between Ohio and DC (off campus). My dad was paying for my gym membership kinda as a prolonged gift and to be honest it was too expensive and he has hit some finically troubles at the company. To save some money I switched to Planet Fitness in August and pay for that myself for the time being along with a car payment. So I really don\u2019t have room in the budget to even look for another gym.\n\nAnyways, I use this app to track my progress called FitBod (iOS) and it\u2019s pretty good! It keeps all my progress and recommends weight to you. When I do a max out, it adjusts my future workouts according to my bench, squat, and deadlift, etc. \n\nBefore switching, I was maxing out at 275 pounds on bench, 405 on squat, and 415 on deadlift. \n\nGoing to Planet Fitness is real nice and all because it\u2019s clean, well kept, and has dumbbells at least, but no free weight racks. However, they use smith machines, and no free weight racks. \n\nI\u2019m stuck doing bench with dumbbells or the smith machine. The dumbbells only go up to 60. \nSquatting is okay, still a smith machine or just high reps on dumbbell squat. I can only do vent leg deadlift on the machine, or do real high/slow reps for deadlift. \n\nWhen I came home in October, my bench went down along with my deadlift. My squat was the same. (I bought a day pass to my old gym). Anyways same deal in October basically, but my bench and deadlift are back to normal and my squat is at +10. Needless to say I\u2019ve plateaued on at least bench and deadlift. \n\nI\u2019m looking for some advices or technique on maybe how to adjust my form on dumbbell press, and dumbbell squat to hopefully be able to max our higher. I see legitimately big dudes at Planet Fitness and I talked to a few of them and I got some advice from them, basically just going on real slow reps.

Couldn\u2019t get my third bench, 3 whites on everything else. Great time. Default gold.\n\nNow for the longread thinkpiece.\n\nThe lead-up to the meet:\n\nJust competed in my first USPA meet after only doing USAPL before. Also haven\u2019t done a meet since September 2016. I got coached by u/GZCL from October 2016-April 2017 when I was supposed to compete but had a high hamstring/glute injury that wouldn\u2019t let me low bar squat or conventional deadlift without pain. The rest of 2017 ended up being a wash as I to deal with some shitty family stuff across the country though I dropped in to gyms when I could. Later 2017 into 2018 basically became a reset. I got sober. Had a big, good job change. I switched gyms. Ran 5/3/1 for beginners while I got back into the swing of things. Eventually hopped back on a bastardized GZCL that I program myself  and did a cut (247lb ---> 225). Slowly bulked back up to around 238 by the time of the meet.\n\nDuring 2018 I herniated a disc, rehabbed, had to switch up my deadlift stance for awhile, lost some progress. Then sprained my left knee (my until-that-point good knee). This put me off deadlifting and squats for about a month. I was able to do high rack pulls, dumbbell deadlifts, and some cable squats during both of these injuries.\n\nSigned up for this meet back in the middle of October once I was sure I was healthy again. Switched my programming to an upper/lower split and planned on using the UHF 3 week peak/taper. Everything was pretty uneventful from there in a good way. Biggest change I made was picking up a Pioneer cut belt from EliteFTS to use for deadlifts. I\u2019d been using my Inzer lever belt for everything, but decided I wanted some easier adjustment options for my deadlift because I like a looser belt for deads. It made a world of difference for my deadlift training. I hit a PR of 520 lb. a few weeks out from my peak. Also hit a 455 lb. squat PR during my peak kinda on accident.\n\nThe Meet:\n\nFirst USPA meet, first 24 hour weigh-in. I didn\u2019t really need it, but it was nice. I was trying my hardest to gain weight and the day before the weigh ins I was down 5 lb. from my heaviest during this whole cycle. Oh well, wilks padding. I weighed in at 106kg for the 110kg class. We were staying in town near the meet so Friday was just filled with eating and relaxing. It ruled.\n\nSaturday was meet day. I was doing Open Raw. The facility was pretty good, lots of space, great crowd, great commentator going all day. The venue is a nice all-around strength sports gym. 4 power racks and 2 combo benches for warm ups. Only complaint was a lack of deadlift bars. It\u2019s been forever since I pulled on one and I was really looking forward to using one for warm ups, but didn\u2019t get the chance. When they first announced flights I was in flight D (last flight). When they put the start lists up I was in flight B. The flights were all kind of weird. My attempts were consistently the heaviest in my flight (a first for me).\n\nMy bench and deadlift openers were meet PRs. Squat was a little lower than my meet PR. I like to start the day with a confidence boost, and had no competition so just wanted to get on the board. Also go away with not having to use a squat bar. No idea why. They switched it out after my flight for the other two flights. But I was happy because I hate that bar.\n\nSquats (3/3, 9 white lights)\n\n[Squat 1: 187.5/413](https://youtu.be/vVFEkTCTHbE)\n\n[Squat 2: 200/441](https://youtu.be/q4nYCa3Bp1s) Meet PR\n\n[Squat 3: 210/463](https://youtu.be/oSlmdvfDIFg) 7 lb. overall PR\n\nBench (2/3, 6 white lights)\n\nThe designated handoff guy was terrible. I normally don\u2019t use a handoff in the gym except for PR attempts, because it does help but I also have severe social anxiety and don\u2019t want to deal with people. My rack height was wrong on my first attempt (not on the spotters, they entered it wrong on the spreadsheet) so that threw me off. But no big deal. I should have self-unracked the third attempt after learning my lesson on the first two.\n\n[Bench 1: 130/287](https://youtu.be/vjB90A1eHRg) Meet PR\n\n[Bench 2: 137.5/303](https://youtu.be/oquDzA4KhsY) Meet PR\n\n[Bench 3: 145/320](https://youtu.be/rhlWh6gPtGE) miss\n\nDeadlift (3/3, 9 white lights)\n\nAgain, had no real idea what the deadlift bar was going to do. Never pulled over 4 plates on one. And deads overall have been going great for me. I should have gone a lot heavier on these. I didn\u2019t have any struggle at all until my third and even then it was nothing.\n\n[Deadlift 1: 215/474](https://youtu.be/eWh6sjr1hyA) meet PR\n\n[Deadlift 2: 227.5/502](https://youtu.be/Wm3fHBXBrjE) meet PR\n\n[Deadlift 3: 240/529](https://youtu.be/mVvqqeEO90I) 9 lb PR overall\n\nDefault gold as the only person in the 110kg class, raw or otherwise. Overall the meet was great. Organized beautifully. Started more or less right on time and ran smooth from start to finish. Only issues were with lifters who had entered their attempts wrong, and the meet director was pretty forgiving. A couple of bomb outs, but nobody dumped any bars. Spotters, loaders and refs were awesome.  Better in every way than any USAPL meet I\u2019ve ever done. And better yet it\u2019s relit the fire under me. I think I qualified for drug tested nationals? Not sure if I\u2019ll do that, thought Vegas is a quick trip.

So after going to the gym for some time now ive studied the biological mechanisms of muscle growth, but endurance/stamina is confusing, mostly because there isnt as much information on it as there is on muscle growth. Id like to know what exactly are the factors that make up a persons stamina/endurance. So far here is what i think i know :\n\n1. V02 max is the maximum rate at which your body can take in oxygen. \n\n2. Stamina is dependent on V02 max, how efficient/strong your heart is, your lactic acid tolerance, and your lung capacity. (Am i missing any other factors?) \n\n3. To train stamina you either take very low effort but high duration workouts like jogging to build aerobic stamina, and high effort low duration work like HIIT or sprints to increase anarobic thresholds. \n\nI think my main question is how do you train to be able to run/lift/fight for longer. Like how soccer players can run back and forth the field for 90 mins whereas im winded after sprinting for <100m. Or how mma fighters condition themselves to be able to produce max punching power for so many reps in a fight and not gas out after 5 punches. \n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6938057, "post_title": "Physiological adaptations of endurance/stamina?", "post_ups": 1, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/akj6hm/physiological_adaptations_of_endurancestamina/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-15 22:01:33.410422", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "pretysmitty", "post_created_utc": 1548644665.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "akj5if", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 13, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 6, "post_selftext": "Does it matter if I have to lean my entire body back while doing face pulls?

I was sitting/playing video games at home for like 3 years and doing nothing but that and eating.\n\nI was about 101kg before I started losing weight, but not with going to the gym. I started doing alot of Bodyweight/Hiit exercises at home while I was in a big caloric deficit like 1000- from my maintanence. That was also the time I started to learn a profession (IT technician) because I no longer wanted to play video games anymore (because I got bored of it). I basically wanted to play real life haha. For the weight loss it was going really good, I lost atleast 0,7-1kg about every 3 days.In total I lost about 34kg. After 8 months I had 67kg and decided that I want to do weight training. So I went to a gym and got a membership. I started @ 01.01.2017 like a new years resolution right? Maybe. I don't like if people set new year resolutions like they need a new year to start something. You don't need a new year to start anything, you can start right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway my Physique started to change very quickly after joining the gym, that was also the point where I was informing myself about fitness alot like nutrition/training/supplements to maximize my gains.\n\nMy first split was basically a 4 day bro split. People hate on bro splits alot which is understandable (I would never do them anymore) but for a newbie it was totally okay and I made some good gains.\n\nAfter that I went hardcore and switched to a 6day PPLxPPL. And I made incredible gains with that split. Even though it had alot of volume I managed to do it for 8months or so. (this is where my bench/deadlift started to increase)\n\nAnd right now I'm doing a 4-5 Split (PHUL) which is pretty good for me (alot of Volume).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I don't exactly know what happened in my head that I changed from playing video games non stop to going to the gym and having a life (I guess I was bored from video games) working, living in my own apartment, having a girlfriend but I like it and it was the best decision I ever made, I'm very happy right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If anyone is interested in my lifts.**\n\nMy 1RM right now are:\n\nBench: 90KG (low as fuck I know)\n\nSumo Deadlift: 150kg\n\nSumo Squat: 130kg\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I do sumos because I was born with  shortened Achilles tendon and clubfeet, my balance is really bad.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Body:**\n\n174cm\n79,5kg\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf any of you are in the same position that I was 2 years before or got any questions you may want to ask, feel free to ask.\n\nI'm a very helpful kind of person especially when it comes to fitness because it's such an interesting topic for me :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf there were any spelling/grammar mistakes I made, I apologize.

I'm fully aware that the whole \"lifting stunts your growth\" thing is a myth. But I'm also aware that depriving your body of nutrients is very capable of stunting growth. Right now I'm 16, about 5'10.5, 176lbs and want to get down to about 155-160lbs. I plan on doing this by losing around 2lbs a week (1000calorie deficit per day). I know that 2lbs is the maximum one is supposed to lose weight at to maintain a healthy diet, so I'm just curious, is 2lbs per week gonna stunt my growth? Would I be better being more patient and losing 1lb per week? The reason I'm set on a goal of 2 is that I've been boxing for a while and there are fights on the summer that I'd be eligible for if I got my weight down, but I don't wanna fuck up my height just for a competition. I'm not starving myself, I'm using intermittent fasting to be able to make the diet easier, and I'm eating a lot of fish, chicken and rice for my meals, but I just wanna make sure that 2lbs is a safe weight to lose at this age, especially being in that deficit for a long time period. I've been cutting for around 3 weeks now, and should take me around another 7-10weeks to get to my target weight if I keep this deficit.

If you're curious about the beginner program, look [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9ry1st/review_of_jon_andersens_deep_water_beginner/)\n\nAnd for the intermediate program, look [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/a6avfn/program_reviewjon_andersens_deep_water/)\n\n\nI have completed the Deep Water Advanced program, in doing so finishing 18 weeks of the most hellacious training I\u2019ve ever engaged in.  I got bigger, stronger, and experienced a lot of growth physically and psychologically.  In this program, I made some significant deviations, but I feel the intent was still met and the goals were realized.\n\n**THE PROGRAM**\n\nOnce again, this comes out of the Deep Water book, which you can get for free of Jon Andersen\u2019s Instagram account or for $10 off Amazon, so I\u2019m not going to write up the whole thing here.  For a summary though, it\u2019s still 4 days a week of lifting and 1 day of active recovery.  The training is not quite as predictable as the previous two programs though.  You typically will have 2 Deep Water days and 2 non-Deep Water Days.  The latter have you work up to a topset of 10 in 5 sets on a variety of movements (press, cleans, rows, etc) or have the same bench press workout that were in the first two workouts, along with some assistance work.  The former have you work up to a topset of 5 within 5 sets, then take that weight and multiply it by .65 and do as many reps as possible with that amount.  You then rest 5-8 minutes and do it again with a weight that is half the amount of your topset of 5.  This is done with a wide variety of movements, to include squats, deadlifts, push press, clean and press (clean each rep from the floor), cleans, front squat press, etc.  Some Deep Water days have additional assistance work, some don\u2019t.\n\nThis program is really just less predictable than the previous 2, so it\u2019s a bit hard to sum up what a week will look like.  Usually a week will start with a Deep Water workout, but after that it\u2019s something of a wildcard.  You go a bit longer between bench workouts as a result, and you find yourself doing a LOT of cleans, so hopefully you kept practicing hard during the beginner/intermediate program.\n\nFor those AMRAP sets, you NEED to dig deep if you want to get the most out of them.  The first 2 weeks of the program sorta work like a break-in, similar to the other 2 programs, but after that you need to make sure you\u2019re leaving it all in the gym.  Without doing that, you\u2019re not going to get much from the program.\n\n\n\n**NUTRITION**\n\nNo changes here as far as foods good; primarily meat and veggies.  However, I found the volume to be a little less on this program, so not as much need for huge portions.\n\n\n\n**DEVIATIONS AND X-FACTORS**\n\nUnlike the previous 2 programs, I ended up having some more extension deviations here, and I feel they are worth detailing for the sake of full disclosure.\n\n* I ran this program \u201cinverted\u201d as it were.  Basically, my final lower body workout for Deep Water Intermediate was a deadlift workout, so I wanted to squat the following week.  However, Deep Water Advanced started with deadlifts, so I went to week 2 and started there to get in the squat workout.  That meant that, after finishing week 2, I ran week 1.  After week 1, I then ran week 4, so that I\u2019d do another squat workout, then did week 3, then week 6, and finished with week 5.  Ultimately, I don\u2019t think this impacted the results much, as I got the whole workout done in the time slotted, but just something to note.\n\n* I screwed up the assistance work on a few workouts.  Just minor things.  Skipped box jumps one day, made them up on another, etc.  This wasn\u2019t\u2019 because I felt it was the better way to do it, it was just blatant non-compliance due to not looking up the program before I trained.  Thought I had the right idea, turned out I didn\u2019t.\n\n* Somewhere along the line, I did a deadlift workout that I didn\u2019t need to do.  I honestly don\u2019t know how I worked it into the program, but I ended up setting a solid program PR on it, so it was a win.\n\n* Biggest complete deviation came in the final 2 weeks of the program.  One of the Deep Water days required full cleans.  I simply don\u2019t have that skillset, and unlike power cleans, which I had been building up to through the beginner and intermediate program, there was no break-in here.  I weighed my options and decided log cleans would fit closest to the requirements here.  It was still a floor to chest exercise that requires me to hold the implement in a squatting position.  Not quite right, but close enough.  Another Deep Water workout required thrusters (or front squat press, as it was called in the program) and, again, just not a skillset I have.  I opted to make these into log viper presses for a similar argument.  Final Deep Water workout required clean and push press, each rep from the floor.  I originally wanted to make this an axle continental and press, since I\u2019m better at that than cleaning, but I think the decision to do the log vipers was a poor strategy, because my forearms were fried and I seemed to just have zero explosiveness for the workout.  I pretty much had nothing left, and walked away from that workout disappointed. \n\n* Most significant factor was nutrition, and this was due to illness.  I came down with a bad stomach bug right around the second week of the program.  Vomited 8 times in the span of 4 hours and lost about 5lbs in a day.  The second order effect though was that my appetite was shot for about 2 weeks after that.  I force fed as much as I could in that time, but I was struggling to get in the amount of food needed.  Pair that with the fact that volume is significantly scaled down on this program compared to beginner and intermediate, and the catalyst for big food intake simply wasn\u2019t there.  It ended up meaning that I would eventually regain the lost weight, but not much else on the program.\n\n\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nWhereas Beginner and Intermediate were about setting up for some big PRs, this was the time to start realizing them.  I added 30lbs to my SSB squat 5rm in 5 weeks on the program.  I added 10lbs to my deadlift 5rm in 3 weeks.  My press 10rm went up 15lbs through the program, set under greater states of fatigue.  Axle Bench went from 3x7 at 291 to 2x10 and 1x7 at the same weight.  Power cleans increased as well.\n\n\n\nOnce again though, for the most part, the changes are far more mental than anything else.  Having the AMRAP backoff sets in the program really gave me an opportunity to dig deep, and I got to find out what I was made of.  The first 2 weeks, I was disappointed in the effort I produced, but by the end of the program, I knew I was leaving it all out there.  I had gashed my hand early in the Deep Water power clean workout, and ended up just putting some chalk in it to hit a 30 and 40 rep set.  I\u2019d also lost my fear of heavy max work, and was able to just set up and execute.  I got to see the manifestation of improved willpower during that vomiting spell I had as well, as typically vomiting takes a LOT out of me, but this time I\u2019d roll up to the toilet, puke, go chug a Gatorade to get back some fluids and get ready to do it all again in a half hour.  It sucked, I didn\u2019t feel great, but I didn\u2019t let it debilitate me.  In turn, I was able to be active and train the next day, a little weakened, but not significantly so.\n\n\n\nAs previously noted, that vomiting did not help with weight gain, and my bodyweight basically stayed the same for this program.  That I was able to regain the 5 lost pounds may mean that I\u2019d have experienced some growth absent that illness.\n\n\n\n**CLOSING THOUGHTS AND MOVING FORWARD**\n\n* Understanding this from the framework of 5/3/1, the Beginner and Intermediate programs are leaders, and the Advanced program is an anchor.  When I first read the book, I thought it was \u201cIf you\u2019re a beginner, you do the beginner program.  Intermediate does intermediate, etc.\u201d  However, it\u2019s more like \u201cWhen you\u2019re a beginner to the METHOD, you do beginner.  That preps you for the intermediate program for the method, and then you\u2019re ready for the advanced.\u201d  And it really IS a question about getting prepped for it.  I\u2019ve been training for 19 years, but if I just jumped into the advanced program, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten NEARLY as much out of it.  I\u2019d not pushed as hard on the Deep Water sets, as I just wouldn\u2019t have that all built into me.  After 12 weeks of absolutely killing myself, I knew how to unleash.\n\n\n\n* The volume is lower on this program, which is obvious on looking at it, but in turn that\u2019s going to mean less nutrition required and less weight gained.  Like an anchor program, you\u2019re looking to express strength here, not build.  Always eat to support training.\n\n\n\n* For my active recovery work, I ended up picking up the boxing gloves after about 7 years off and hitting the heavy bag.  I think this coincides with the fact that, after all this time on the program, it seemed like my hormones kicked into overdrive.  Libido was crazy, aggression was high, and I had the need to fight again.  That\u2019s been welling up in me for a while, but I usually battle it back, thinking I\u2019m done with combat sports.  I usually scoff at the whole \u201csquats release hormones\u201d stuff, but maybe there is some truth to it when you spend 18 weeks doing 100 reps of them.\n\n\n\n* Moving forward from here is tough.  I\u2019m getting corrective vision surgery at the end of the month, which I\u2019ll treat as a 1 week deload after 18 weeks without one (which is another interesting point for the program, as I was very much accustomed to a deload every 6 weeks of training but never got run into the ground enough to need it).  After that, I\u2019ll hear what the doc says about recovery, and I\u2019ll look to see if a strongman competition is happening in April, and if it looks any good.  If so, I\u2019ll train for that.  If not, I may just run this all over again depending on how much weight I lose with my time off.  There are changes I\u2019ll make, now that I\u2019ve run it in earnest.  I\u2019ll swap out buffalo bar squats with SSB, and probably trade out deadlift bar deadlifts with an axle.  That will make the squats a little easier and the deadlifts a little harder, which will be a solid balance.  Thinking I\u2019d eliminate the ab circuit and bring back the ab wheels, just because they take less time.  Might try to get in a little more running and boxing as well, as I keep seeing myself as getting to be a little bit better at those things.  I\u2019ve contemplated also running 5/3/1 BBB Beefcake as a means of easing myself back into Deep Water, and I think that\u2019d be a solid approach for anyone interested in the program.  ANOTHER option I have in mind is to buy the \u201cDeep Water Badass\u201d program and see what that is all about.

Looking good/feeling good, except for a bit of extra weight on my stomach left over from the aggressive weight gain when I actually had time to eat. It's enough that the abs I used to have don't show through anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my question, after all that, is what are some tips to drop that bit of weight around the stomach without hurting muscle growth and development. Every spot else on my body is showing great improvement. I eat fairly healthy and try to limit big caloric intakes to around gym time. Just curious if anyone had any thoughts.

Prior to that, I had been using no set program and just built my own workouts around the compound lifts, doing everything (including compounds) for 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps.  No set progression system and my squat really struggled to progress.  Recently went to doctor over back pain and was advised to hold off on the squats and deadlifts for a while and going to PT next week for back pain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am so damn confused on what the hell I need to be doing to achieve my goals.  I hardly give a crap about raw strength, and almost entirely just workout because I want to look better (get bigger), be healthier, and have good posture.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was advised on the daily questions thread months ago to just pick any program to get my compounds up to \"upper novice levels\" before considering anything else.  I was told that size and strength basically just go hand in hand anyways.  Great.  I have it figured out.  Just increase my compound and assistance lift numbers, progress, diet correctly, and that's it.  I'll get bigger.  My bench (dumbbells) is now at 60lb each hand.  OHP at 70lb.  So you know, I figure just keep on going.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBUT THEN I see progress posts like this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/97pahw/progress\\_post\\_20\\_m\\_57\\_3\\_year\\_transformation\\_121lb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/97pahw/progress_post_20_m_57_3_year_transformation_121lb/)\n\nThis guy looks DAMN GOOD, and claims that he is only benching 60lb dumbbells at the time of the post.  He has a huge focus on assistance work.  He doesn't even track his calories.  Sleeps around 6 hours a night.  I see this, scratch my confused-ass head and wonder why the hell I'm doing 5/3/1 when I could just follow this dude's routine since it appears to work even though he's doing the opposite of what Jim Wendler says to do in various areas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould I even progress my dumbbell bench press anymore if I can manage to look like him with just 60 pounders?  It seems pointless to progress my weight if just staying where I'm at for a while will do just fine.  I'm really concerned I'm not doing the right stuff to achieve my goals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo anyone who feels somewhat experienced: Do I just keep progressing my weight and I'll get bigger?  Should I quit progressing my weight via 5/3/1 and switch to just doing 8-12 reps (and progressing when I can easily hit 12 for 3 sets)?  Do I need to run a different program?  I'm very confused on how to reach my goals now and if I'm doing the right thing.  If my question doesn't make sense I can clarify.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: People keep interpreting my words as being frustrated about not seeing progress in a few months.  That is not the case at all.  I\u2019m well aware that time is a major factor in body building.  Literally look in the above paragraph.  I\u2019m asking WHAT I need to do.  Not HOW LONG.

So even though I'm 61, I'm pretty sure I'd classify as a beginner. I've only been lifting a few months. I weigh 225, and I'm 5'11\".

But I can do three sets of ten reps each at 205.\n\nSo I find an online calculator, and tell it I can do 30 reps at 205. It says my 1rm is 400! Clearly crazy. I find another that limits number of reps to 10, and at 205  that returns a 1RM of 276. Which would mean my best effort is only 75% of my 1RM. Which doesn't seem right either? And if I set the reps to 3, it gives me 223, which would mean I'm lifting 95%, for 30 reps, every session.\n\nSo there's something wrong with my calculations, or the way I'm going about things.

I am exercising in addition to fixing my diet.** Back to topic, I do not enjoy running due to high impact nature of this exercise. Ellipticals are fine but since I workout at home, it's out of the question at the moment. Recently I have been doing low impact cardio workouts through YouTube and another fitness site that I have a subscription through. It has really been so invigorating. Unlike machine assisted cardio workouts, you are not repeating similar body motion over and over again. I can already feel a huge improvement in my cardiovascular health. A 30 minute cardio video where I gave up within 10 minutes on first day , I can now complete all the way through without taking extended breaks. Since there are countless number of videos that are available out on the internet, I feel like I can do a new cardio workout every day of the year without repeating any of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what is currently working for me.

Sorry if this is a bit long but I just feel like I need to vent - thank you in advance if you read the whole thing.\n\nOver the last 3-4 years I've been working out I've tried many different programs (SL 5x5, ICF, and my own routines). I've definitely seen progress since I started, but for the amount of time I've been working out, I just really feel like if I was doing things correctly (diet, form, routines, etc) and putting in my all, I could've been ripped by now. (For reference, I'm 25 years old, 5'6, 145lb).\n\nI just feel kind of lost. My best trait is consistency (only a few periods throughout the last few years have I \"fallen off\" of the gym - otherwise I never miss a workout) - but apparently I've been consistently doing the wrong thing for years since my progress has been so slow.\n\nNow I'm stuck in a cycle of coming up with a new routine, doing that for 1-3 weeks, then changing it up again. Like I'll start to feel I'm not focusing on X body part enough, so I'll try to add that in. But then I'll see a dude with a huge back at the gym and decide I need more back work, so I rework my routine again to try to add more back.\n\nI can't tell if I should be doing fewer exercises but focusing only on compounds, or do less compounds but add in more accessories (like I do now).\n\nI feel like my slow progress is in part due to my effort in the gym - I definitely try hard, but I don't think I can say I'm giving 100% effort on every rep for every set.\n\nI'm trying to focus on my form to really make sure I'm hitting the muscles as I should be, but then I also feel like in order to do that I'm not using weights heavy enough to really make any difference in terms of muscle development.\n\nI don't know if I should be trying to gain weight or lose weight. I want to get bigger and more muscular, but I still want to stay lean. I've bulked in the past and literally all that happened was me getting a gut with little muscle development to make up for it.\n\nI'm just feeling a bit defeated, especially when I see other people who have seen such successful transformations (the posts on /r/brogress are inspiring, but also just make me feel kinda shitty about myself for not seeing the same type of progress).\n\nI'm just not really sure where to go from here - any advice would be really appreciated.

Any food or drink with a caloric value will cause a spike in insulin because insulin is the hormone that regulates whether you store fat or release it.

Or for example would going Monday - Wednesday - Friday for the weight days with, say, Thursday being the cardio day work out? I'm fairly clueless about this so I'm wondering if squeezing the cardio day in the middle is fine or not, as I would assume it works completely different muscles from the one that I'd be working on the other days, but it might be important to have a rest from all strenuous exercise full stop.\n\nThanks for any input on this, and if you have any other suggestions or anything I'd be happy to hear them!\n\nTL;DR: Looking to do Phrak's Greyskull LP Variant and am wondering if doing a day of cardio between two of the days I would work the routine is a good or bad idea.

I am going through some physical life changes that will hopefully leave me healthier, but my stepfather told me I am doing it all wrong and I need a second opinion!\n\nSome backstory: Ever since my stepfather moved in with us about a year ago, I would say that the family diet went from 3-4 cooked/ prepared meals a week down to 1. Now most of our meals are packaged freezer foods like popcorn shrimp or fries, which we normally throw into the deep fryer instead of the oven, so they are double-fried. In the last month or two I have been really noticing that I have low energy and my overall mood has been declining. About 2 weeks ago, I decided I needed to make a change to preserve my happiness. I started going to the gym with a friend, and just in the time that we\u2019ve been doing that, I have been feeling significantly better. \n\nI\u2019m not overweight, but I would like to cut back some body fat and develop some visible muscle tone, which I think is a realistic goal. In order to help myself accomplish that goal, I figured it would be good for me to pass on the fried freezer foods and cook some healthier stuff, which has also made me happier because I love to cook! I am super happy with the changes I have made with my lifestyle, and I can see myself sustaining these habits for the long term. \n\nMy stepdad confronted me today and said that I am wasting my time and that I am only putting my body in shock by suddenly beginning working out and by cutting the (obviously) bad foods out of my diet. Is this true? I haven\u2019t changed to a drastic diet where every calorie is accounted for and all of X foods are cut from my diet, etc. I have only tried to increase the quality of the foods that I have been eating from fried garbage to prepared meals. For example, my parents ate twice-fried popcorn shrimp and fries tonight and I cooked some red snapper and asparagus on the stove. I truly do not see what could be wrong with what I am doing. Let me know what you think! Thanks!\n\nTL;DR: My family eats fried foods for dinner almost every night and I think that diet has caused my mood to decline over the last few months. In an effort to be happier, I\u2019ve started going to the gym about 2 weeks ago and cutting back on obviously unhealthy foods like the fried stuff, and started cooking meals from fresh ingredients. Is this sudden lifestyle and diet change a bad thing for my body?

I'm reaching out to the r/fitness community for some help. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nStats:\n\n30 years old\n\nMale\n\n6'4\" (1.93m), 208lbs (94.3kg)\n\nBFP \\~17%\n\n[Body Composition Pics](https://imgur.com/a/0GY5wp3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBench 1RM: 275lbs (124.7kg)\n\nSquat 1RM: 325lbs (147.4kg)\n\nDeadlift 1RM: 415lbs (188.2kg) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBackground:\n\nEver since my sophomore year of high school (10th year), I've been weight training. I've always had a long, lanky build but I've usually been able to keep up with my peers as far as strength goes. I've fluctuated from as little as 175lbs to 220lbs. However, no matter what I do- how I train or how I eat- I cannot seem to put on mass like my peers. When I do put on weight it starts with fat that accumulates on my chest and gut, giving me that \"skinny fat\" look with man boobs and a pot belly. I've tried every training program you can imagine from Starting Strength 3 days per week to hypertrophy rep ranges with super sets 6 days per week. Same can be said about dieting. I've tried clean bulks, dirty bulks, bulking then cutting. I've tried keto diets, I've tried intermittent fasting and I religiously count my calories. I've had calorie ranges from as little as 1,700 per day to over 3,500. With every program and diet I try it for at least 12 weeks. Sometimes as long as 6 months. I just don't see the progress I feel like I should.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently, I am on a keto diet and intermittent fasting- eating in an 8 hour window each day. I consume 2,112 calories and my macros are 36g carbs, 144.3g fat, 158g protein. I do not use supplements of any kind. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy training program was developed by a professional weight lifting coach for the purpose of body building. Along with the program below I will do 30 minutes of sprints, 30 seconds on, 120 seconds walking. I sprint 2-3 times per week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 1\n\nBench 3x8 at 75% of max\n\nSquat 3x8 at 75% of max\n\nDeadlift 3x6 at 75% of max\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 2\n\nDB Bench 2x6-8\n\nChin Up 3x12-15\n\nCable Row 2x12\n\nStanding Press 2x6-8\n\nEZ Bar Curl 5x8\n\nMachine Curl 20/10/10/10 (15 second rest)\n\nTricep Extension 4x8\n\nTricep Pushdown 20/10/10/10 (15 second rest)\n\nSPRINTS\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 3\n\nSquat 4x6 at 80%\n\nBench 4x6 at 80%\n\nLeg Ext 2x10\n\nLeg Curl 2x10\n\nCalf Raise 50/20/20/20 (15 second rest)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 4 Sprints\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 5\n\nDeadlift 4x3 at 85%\n\nBench 5x4 at 85%\n\nDB Fly 2x12-15\n\nLat Pulldown 3x12-15\n\nDB Row 3x10 -superset- DB Shrug 3x10\n\nDB Lat Raise 2x15\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 6 Sprints\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 7\n\nSquat 5x4 at 85%\n\nLeg Ext 30/15/15/15 (15 second rest)\n\nLeg Curl 30/15/15/15 (15 second rest)\n\nPreacher Curl 5x12-15\n\nMachine Curl 20/10/10/10 (15 second rest)\n\nTri Pushdown 3x12-15\n\nTri Pushdown 20/10/10/10 (15 second rest)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been on this diet and training program for about 3 months now and I have seen little change in body composition. I've increased in strength and I've lost 4 lbs. I don't see any new definition or size in any muscle group. This is how I've always been. Even when my weight does fluctuate, I don't seem to gain much if any muscle mass. It all seems to come from fat. I've done similar programs and diets for just as long and longer with the same results.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like I train hard at the gym and I leave fatigued. I have muscle soreness most days. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? I feel like I'm going insane putting in all this effort for no reason and I'm starting to feel like it's not worth it any more. If anyone has any advice I have open ears and eyes. I want to improve! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: The general consensus is that I\u2019m not eating enough and possibly training too hard. From the sounds of it, I need to increase to around 3,000 calories and cut back on the cardio. I also plan to vary my lifts more and up the volume while decreasing weight for the core lifts. I feel like a pile of crap if I don\u2019t go to the gym at least four times a week so I\u2019ll probably keep a 5 day split and focus more volume and less on super heavy weight. \n\nThank you to everyone for the suggestions and constructive feedback. I\u2019ll try to post again in 6 months if I\u2019ve made significant progress.

My goal is to be summer shredded and under 10% bf by Memorial day. Im curious as to how much cardio and what kind of cardio would you recommend? Other than going to gym im not active at home either since it's winter, as I either do more work on computer or if I have time movies/videogames.

I don't really break a sweat doing this so I'm not sure if it's actually being effective. Is there a way to know? Also am I waiting my time with this and just do HIIT?
