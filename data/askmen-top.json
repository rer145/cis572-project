In fact, we are celebrating our anniversary next month. She's a wonderful person who has been nothing but fully supportive of whatever I do. I've started a low carb diet and lost around 40 pounds in 6 months. While everyone was criticizing it (oh you need carbs, this is unhealthy, blah blah blah), she was there for me through and through. In fact, she got on the same diet and lost 5 pounds just so we both have the same routine and plan. Throughout my weight loss journey, she'd always compliment me and make me feel better about myself (I kind of had some self-esteem issues). I've reached my weight goal a few weeks ago and I'm over the moon. I've been hitting the gym to gain muscle, joined and completed marathons, but the most surprising out of all was the attention I've been getting from women. Something that never happened before. \n\nSo last night, I was out with a few friends without the gf. She claimed to have a headache, but I'm pretty sure she's planning our anniversary (she loves planning stuff). I get to the bar, and there were a bunch of people that I haven't seen since highschool 10 years ago. One of which was a cute girl I remember from back then. I was chatting with her throughout the whole night. She was so amused by my weight loss and she told me how she wants to become a nutritionist and help people out. We had so much in common that made me lose track of how much I drank. Since I'm on low carb, alcohol gets me drunk so much faster. Everyone gets drunk also and decides to head back to the girls place. I, on the other hand, was completely wasted so I can't remember most of what happened. I woke up in the morning with one hell of a hangover, and my friend filled me up with all the events from last night. I was mortified. Apparently, they all got pizza and I ate a whole meat cravers pan crust with extra cheese pizza all by myself. I can already see the disappointment in my gfs face. \n\nWhat's your cheat story?", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 964626, "post_title": "I cheated and I feel like crap.

He would frequently bring girls back to the dorm even though he claimed he had a girlfriend. Anyways one night he brought a girl home who woke me up at 3am by screaming during sex. I consider myself to be a calm reasonable person so I did what any calm reasonable person would do. I got out my phone connected to the Bluetooth speaker in his room and played a [video](https://youtu.be/xFOeQDJjSos) about queefing at max volume. She shut up really quickly and my roommate told me they were so embarrassed they just layed on the bed listening to some girl explain queefs to them for five minutes. I slept like a baby after that. \n\nEdit: I guess I need to clarify that my roommate wasn't actually mad at me. It wasn't the first time he had loud screamy sex in the dorm room and I was getting sick of his shit so that's why I got him back. I ignored it the first couple of times and when it got to be a semi regular occurrence I knew it was time to go nuclear on his ass. Anyway the next day he admitted he deserved it and he would try to be more quite in the future. \n\nEdit 2: Come on guys some of you are bashing me for not taking the moral high road on someone who woke me and my two other roommates up by screaming in our ears during sex at 3am in a shared dorm room. They made it awkward for us so I made it a thousand times more awkward for them and had fun doing it. I regret nothing. He got what he deserved.\n\nEdit 3: Keep the I'm a loser for pranking my roommate for scream fucking in a shared dorm room in front of his roommates messages coming. I'm not taking this post down.\n\nEdit 4: Yes I am a cuck dirty virgin loser who is an effeminate soy boy daddies. Keep abusing me with your messages, but I can only cum so much from your punishment. You are going to put me in the hospital. A boy needs rest. \n\nEdit 5: All your punishment is making me so hard.  I'm not even using hands any more I'm just slapping my dick on the keyboard now. It's just you and my dick now. Break my body. We have already established I'm a virgin loser, but come on go harder guys. Keep telling me how pathetic I am. You are about to make me into a ragging love fountain from your punishment. No girl has ever drained my balls as hard as you so obviously superior alpha males have. Make them write 50 shades of mediocre penis from our love story.\n\nEdit 6: *Fifty Shades of Mediocre Penis*\n\n*Chapter One*\n\nIt was a snowy cold winter Sunday. /u/MediocrePenisNumber6 was celebrating his victory over his horny loud roommate when all of a sudden he got a comment from /u/Aguynamedtony. Was it more fans from the internet who also wanted to celebrate in his victory? Hurriedly he opened it and he eagerly read over the contents.\n\n\"Why you getting back at them you get your nut why cant they get theirs. Oh I see the problem you ain't getting no nut off makes sense! Jealousy is a terrible trait\"\n\n/u/MediocrePenisNumber6's heart sank. It wasn't from a fan it was from someone clearly superior to him. He was right /u/MediocrePenisNumber6 was indeed getting no nut. It was like all the other messages and comments that he had gotten before. He was a dirty virgin loser unfit to be called a man. He was still in denial before, but this one, this one sank home. The truth hurt so much. /u/MediocrePenisNumber6 began to feel a deep pain in his chest. He started to cry. But wait it wasn't from his eyeballs that he was crying it was another type of ball entirely. He started to feel some new emotions spring up inside him. /u/Aguynamedtony's rough manly treatment of him made the pain feel... what was it he thought? It was good. The pain felt so good. Then he knew he had seen the light. /u/Aguynamedtony was going to make /u/MediocrePenisNumber6 go from a dirty cuck virgin into a manly sex god who screamed fucked wherever he pleased. /u/MediocrePenisNumber6 was no longer mediocre. His penis was crying big fat tears of his pre boy goo. He could no longer contain it he ripped off pants smashed his precum soaked hard cock right on the part of the screen that had /u/Aguynamedtony's comment. He stared deep into the pixels of his user name. To put it bluntly he fucked the shit out of that computer monitor. He broke the screen but it didn't matter the electric shock and broken glass just sent waves of pure painful pleasure up his penis. With one mighty fuck scream he sent a geyser of his boy love over the broken computer with such force that he knew his ancestors would be proud. But before /u/MediocrePenisNumber6 could fully bask in his glory he felt a hard hand on his shoulder. He had forgotten he was in the campus library. As he was being dragged off he reached out desperately wanting to remain with that which had turned him into a man. But his love was but a tragic one for there was nothing he could do. He had to leave his love behind. /u/MediocrePenisNumber6 cried tears of anguish as he knew he would never see the man who had bestowed manhood on him again.

My 5 year old and 13 year old boys were there playing video games while she laid down in bed not feeling well and had a heart attack apparently. Doctors said she went 45 minutes plus without oxygen to her brain. My 13 year old said that the little one came and said that Mum won't wake up. Her parents are acting like i murdered her and swept my children to their house. Her family is huge and I have none. They were my Family. They are telling me that we were separated and it doesn't matter how long. I was a stay at home dad and also worked nights in the family business. I have a Legal Aid lawyer but they have said i need a private bar lawyer to pursue property issues. I have no money for that. They went into my house and took all the legal documents and jewelry. They took her phone and read all of our intimate text messages. I have had a complete mental breakdown and have so far left my children with them as not to upset them any further and have been dealing with this solely by Myself. How can people be like this regardless of their opinion of our life. We were happy and did it on our own. Just trying to type this out and maybe see what anyone else has to say. I am so confused and broken. Why do these people think my children should lose both parents because we were in a deep argument. 16 years, 10 months and 30 days we were together. House paid off. We must have been doing something right but not according to these people. I am no perfect angel but my heart has always been in the right place. They are very wealthy. All of a sudden my Daughter wont take the phone to speak to me which was a complete surprise yesterday. We did family hugs and said i love you daily. I have always been there and been over the top protective. If they had a problem with my parenting why have they never said it before and now tell me they are \"protecting\" them? I was always a good loving Dad. I am so worried about my children these people are not what my kids need. they need to be with me. They have been with me their entire lives and now this? How can they do this? I miss her so much. I want to comfort my children. They told me to get my \"stuff\" together and in the future I can be the Dad again and they will be the Grandparents. Wth? Who made them the powers of the universe. I need help.\n\nI don't know if this is the right sub.\nThere is so much more to the story.\nIs there anybody out there? I am reaching out to the internet for this as i am stumped legally and so much more.\nI am in Canada if that matters\nKids are now 14, 11, and 5\nIn complete electrifying terror. I miss my Woman so bad. She was the only person I could talk to because we \"got it\" in terms of life. Pressure somehow got to us.\nTrying my best here. Sorry if formatting is bad I am all over the place. There were no abuse issues in the house.

I suck at learning names and I\u2019ve gotten to the point where if you tell me your name I don\u2019t even try to remember it. But since me and her hit it off, this way of thinking has backfired completely. \n\nWhenever I see her I say stuff like \u201chey, girl!\u201d or things that dance along the lines of greeting you but not acknowledging your name. I fear that sooner or later this charade will come to an end and I\u2019d really like to not lose her because I\u2019m super into her. \n\nI\u2019ve contemplated on asking her how to spell her name, or maybe even asking what her last name is. So far searching her number into Facebook and Google has not yielded anything conclusive. All I know is that she\u2019s Colombian and I think she has a Spanish name. Possible Felicia, but I\u2019d hate to guess it and be wrong.\n\nShould I come out and ask her what her name is and risk the back lash or can I play ignorance that I don\u2019t speak Spanish and it didn\u2019t really stick? \n\nEdit: I\u2019d really like to read every comment here but every 2 minutes I get a new one.

Attention, memory, and spatial ability are key cognitive functions affected by testosterone in humans. It is also crucial in promoting risk taking ability in humans. \n\nIn short, Testosterone is the hormone that characteristically makes a man a man.\n\nSince the 80s. the average T levels in men have been declining by 1% a year. That makes for a 30% loss today. Statistically speaking, the average man is 30% less of man than one 30 years ago! That's really significant. This drop affects all those things I've mentioned above that are critical for men's well being. \n\nYet, we don't see it discussed all that often. The kicker is that it's still not fully understood. When controlling for all pertinent factors, the decrease in T-levels is still significant. Dietary choices are considered the most major factor, but to a layman like me, it feels like someday we will find about some bad chemical that's responsible and have a lead-in-water-wasnt-so-good-after-all moment.\n\nI think we can say that decreasing testosterone levels are significantly harming the well-being of the average male in the west. How come nobody is talking about it? \n\nI think it's important to talk about the well-being of men in a society that increasingly demonizes masculinity. What do you guys think? Is this drop in testosterone levels a non-problem in your eyes? If not, what changes have you seen compared to earlier generations of men?\n\nP.S.: Some good articles\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2017/10/02/youre-not-the-man-your-father-was/\n\nhttps://www.healio.com/endocrinology/hormone-therapy/news/print/endocrine-today/%7Bac23497d-f1ed-4278-bbd2-92bb1e552e3a%7D/generational-decline-in-testosterone-levels-observed", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 964626, "post_title": "Men's Testosterone levels in the US have dropped by 30% since 1987.

So let me assume that none of you know what the internet is and how it works and explain why net neutrality is important in the derogatory fashion you have all come to expect from this sub.\n\nImagine that the internet is your mother.  You and your shutin siblings have split up your parents basement and have your own corner of the room.  Now your mother is a kind mother, and caters to you all equally.  Whenever you ask for something, she gives you as much time as she has and does everything as quickly as possible because for some reason, she loves your greasy ass.  This is the internet as it should be: everybody makes requests and gets as much time (bandwidth) as they need and everything is done as fast as possible (latency).  Even if your sister is a needy bitch and always asks for stuff, as long as you make your requests, they will be processed in the order they are received.  That way, nobody is more important than anyone else.\n\nNow imagine that your needy bitch of a sister is a daddy\u2019s girl, and your dad wants your mom to do more stuff for your sister than she does for you.  Your dad thinks that her problems are more important than yours and therefore deserve priority.  Your dad keeps going on about how you\u2019re lazy, you can\u2019t get a job, and you don\u2019t have a girlfriend because you\u2019re a weeb piece of shit who lives in your parent\u2019s basement.  Therefore, in his mind, her requests should come first.  Even if you ask your mom for something before she does, your sister and your dad think that her request should take priority for your mom because she\u2019s the baby of the family and asks for more stuff.  Not only that, your dad thinks that if you want more stuff from your mom, then you should do chores to get it.  That\u2019s not fair to you, right?  You use your mom just like everybody else in your neighborhood: everybody should have equal access to her (like they already don\u2019t).  Your requests should mean just as much as your sister\u2019s, regardless of who she is.  Because that\u2019s the beauty of the your mom: in her eyes, you\u2019re all her disgusting little spawn.  \n\nIn this case, the ISPs are your dad.  Since they get more attention (and money) from bigger, needier companies (your sister), it\u2019s in their best interest to give better service to them because it will net them more money (or more attention because your dad is weird like that).  Which makes sense, but it shouldn\u2019t affect how you browse the internet.  Because if you could clone your mom (aka provide more resources for consumption), then this wouldn\u2019t be a big deal.  But ISPs are cheap, dirty little bastards, and they don\u2019t want to provide us more resources, they want to redistribute the resources they already have and give more of them to the bigger companies.  Not only that, they want to charge you more for using the current service you have because they\u2019re going to downgrade you.  ISPs are against net neutrality because they say it allows them to \u201cinnovate\u201d, but really it just allows them to fuck over laymen like you and me to create more pay-for-basic-service options that will hurt our wallets, because at their core, they recognize the same thing we do: that the internet is a utility and everyone needs it.\n\nSo how can you stop your dad from denying you of your delicious tendies?  Easy, do the same thing you do in the real world: complain to the government.  Go **[here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/)** and send a letter to the FCC (it\u2019s super easy, I did it myself) and you can even call if they don\u2019t answer in a couple hours (those roastie government stooges how dare they ignore my messages ree and such).  This is super important.  These companies have blocked services they don\u2019t like in the past and they\u2019ll do it again.  All you losers who make tons of alt accounts to get around bans can surely make a couple of alt emails to use on battleforthenet.  Put your shitposting and trolling skills to work and save the internet!\n\nHave a nice day,\n\nThe Mods\n", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 964626, "post_title": "Net Neutrality Bullshit and Why It Matters", "post_ups": 3367, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/6mvrp1/net_neutrality_bullshit_and_why_it_matters/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:29.334343", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "MintyyPhresh", "post_created_utc": 1545291627.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "a7vmik", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 512, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3330, "post_selftext": "As a teen and in my early 20s I used sex and physical closeness with men as a subconscious tool to find/feel closeness amongst other human beings.

I don't have a real job, I've been wearing the same clothes for what seems like forever, I look like a druggy, and most of my social experiences include being chased by lunatics all because I couldn't say no to some dog treats.

His twin (a girl) exhibits the traits that I want to see in an adult (the same ones I'm asking of my boy). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdvice please, Men. I don't have man in my life that my son can look up to that can call him out on this bullshit. I don't want to raise a whiny, wimpy asshole who expect to get his way and won't step up to do a decent day's work.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelp? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 964626, "post_title": "(Serious) Widow here.

Now you might ask, \"RK, how do you know these articles are stolen from Askmen?\" which is a very valid question.  Well, the writer in question references a thread directly and [doesn't even bother quoting](http://i.imgur.com/hVdYRRA.png), as seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/Cg2fhn1.png).  That \"weird reddit thread\" is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/5xmn9f/at_what_age_did_you_decide_you_needed_to_settle/) thread.  That was our first clue.\n\nOur second clue was them referencing quotes that one of our mods wrote, as seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/IZQR5wW.png).

But I am specifically telling you NOT to do that, and if we get a single PM of people complaining of harassment related to this, we will go straight to the admins, because doxxing can result in a site-wide ban, so [don't fucking do it.](http://imgur.com/a/0Yuzm)  No matter how [mad](https://i.imgur.com/LEmKh.png) you are, just remember that if you respond, a writer like this will take the responses and surely make an article about it no matter how much we want her to [stop](https://i.imgur.com/GDydgmJ.png).  Living well is the best revenge, so just take comfort in the fact that your responses are [insightful](http://imgur.com/mXyupD1.gif) enough for someone to take them and make a living off of them. \n\nSo in summary: Writer stealing content, don't do anything.\n\nThanks and [have a blessed day](https://i.imgur.com/ji3rn9k.mp4)!\n\nEDIT: Oh right, in an effort to make it more difficult for you to embarrass yourselves, we are locking the comments.

We have gotten good news about the life insurance and 401k, my mother should be financially set and now I'm focusing on just her(and my sister) emotional states while being so far away. I haven't gotten to really identify where I'm at myself as work has been nonstop and I can really express my emotions publicly as my students would be affected. \n\nI really appreciate the reaching out and apologize for not answering back\n\n\nEdit: a word.", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 964626, "post_title": "I'm 23 and my dad just died suddenly, what do I do?", "post_ups": 2538, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/97svnj/im_23_and_my_dad_just_died_suddenly_what_do_i_do/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:29.334343", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "youdontknowanon", "post_created_utc": 1529411326.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "8s8gr7", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 600, "post_num_crossposts": 3, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": true, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2520, "post_selftext": "I'm 33 with a rather healthy sex life.

She did so by breathing in Nitrogen sp that she simply went to sleep rather than feel like she was suffocating.\n\nAll throughout my years in school, she was always there for me to help me recover from my surgeries. During one of my major procedures, she was recovering from some major surgery herself for cancer. I stayed with her and her family. I remember so many nights when she would call me at 2 or 3 in the morning, crying, terrified, tired, exhausted, alone. She just wanted to chat. I would ask her if she wanted me to come over and she would just answer please. Nothing more. I would say be there in a few. I would get dressed, drive to her house, shed let me in. We would just go back to her room, sit/lay on the bed, and I would just wrap my arms around her and hold her close. We wouldnt say a word, there was nothing that needed to be said as it had all been said already. This was in my upperclassmen years of high schools. Her parents were perfectly fine with it and my parents never knew since I usually stayed in my room when at home, making virtually no noise. I didnt even make noise when walking, earning me the nickname ghost from my own family.\n\nI loved her, more than what I thought possible. She loved me. We never did anything about it because of both of our medical issues and in all honesty, probably to protect each other. Instead we were just there for each other in ways that no one else could. We were always there for each other no matter what. She was there the very next day  after I found out my ex was cheating on me while I was in the ICU following spinal fusion surgery.\n\nIt feels like someone has ripped out my heart, my stomach. It feels like I have a fist in my throat. I feel empty,  and weak. I cant go to her funeral. I cant go to her funeral. I cant go to the funerals of those I love most because I cannot see the faces of those I love and see them dead, I cant have that be my last memory of them. I couldnt go to the funeral of the by far most influential man in my life, my grandfather, the man that taught me everything.\n\nShe had a friend of hers post a letter after she had passed and I got it. It hurt so much to read, I cant find the words to accurately describe how it made me feel. I had resolved to do the exact same thing should something ever happen so that I have final word on how I go out rather than let something else make that decision for me, so I would have that final act of mine, that last thing to happen to, to be of my own decision and to choose my own fate, rather than have it be chosen for me. I never once told her this though, it was even the exact same method. She did everything the exact same way that I would.\n\nI want her back. I want to feel her in my arms, to smell her hair, to hear her laugh, to feel her breath on my neck, to see her smile. \n\nI dont know what to do. Help. Please...\n\n\nEdit: as if to make things worse my chronic pain is having another spike so im laying on the ground, too weak and in too much pain to stand, waiting for my pain killers to kick in... thank god she never saw me like this. She never saw me when the pain was bad...\n\nWhen I say I dont trust others, I really mean it. I dont even trust either of my parents enough to ever give more than banal chit chat. I never reveal anything serious to them anymore because of how they responded in the past when I tried talking with them about anything serious in my life.\n\n\n\nI just want someone to hold me...", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 964626, "post_title": "My friend that I was in love with committed suicide due to a losing fight with cancer, what do I do?", "post_ups": 2242, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/7x8h26/my_friend_that_i_was_in_love_with_committed/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:30.867835", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "ExplosiveMachine", "post_created_utc": 1535835018.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1535913925.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "9c6g5i", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 268, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2236, "post_selftext": "HELLO!\n\nWe've recently noticed an influx of questions starting with \"what do you think of\" followed by absolutely anything.\n\nAnd by \"we\" I mean [me](https://i.imgur.com/pyjDSP3.jpg) and by \"recently\" I mean LITERALLY ALWAYS.

He grinned and said, \"Welcome back!\" I smiled right back and thanked him again for his help yesterday. He then told me he needed my info and he'd check the battery for me and if I wanted to get an estimate he could get me that as well. So he asked for my full name and after I have it to him I started freaking out a little inside. I have had a hyphenated last name since I was born, my parents never got married. I thought he might think I was married!! I gave him my keys.\n\nAnyway, I was sitting in the lobby for a while. He was pretty busy and would occasionally come to the front to call people who's cars were ready. I have pretty good peripheral vision and could see him looking my way when he did this. Talk about a green light for me.\n\nI need to tell you this: a few times a car needed to be pulled up for another driver. One of his coworkers did these cars. When he was finished up with my car *he* came in from the side door (still smiling) and said, \"You're all set, I'll pull your car up for you now.\"\n\nI walked outside (totally tripped in the doorway by the way, embarrassing much? Hope he didn't see, LOL) and he drove my car up to where I was standing. He got out and stood there for a second. I said \"Thank you so much for all of your help.\"\n\nThen, /r/AskMen.... then it was time. I had written my phone number down for him. I handed it to him and said, \"Hey, I don't know if you're single (he nodded right here, right away), but here's my number. Give me a call if you'd like to go out for coffee or something sometime.\" He blushed *hard*, smiled even bigger, and said \"I will most definitely do that.\" I think he's shy!! It was so cute. He seemed to have a relieved look on his face. So after exchanging goodbyes, I got into my car and drove off.\n\nOkay, here's where it gets funny. I looked in my purse and realized that I had left my phone in the lobby!! When I was at a red light. Oops. So I cursed myself and drove back. He was doing something at the front desk when I walked in and said, \"I totally left my phone. This kind of stuff happens to me all the time! My keys, my phone...\" (it's true). He kept laughing and looked at me as I walked to go and get it. \n\nWell shit you guys. That was a fantastic experience. I really hope he calls soon! For some reason I'm thinking he will... ;)\n\nThank you guys so much!!! For the support and words of wisdom and funny comments and suggestions. You are all crazy motherfuckers, you know that right?\n\nedit: Went on a soapbox about my personal life, realized it is not needed. Taken out! \n\nedit2: Wow... I have no words for how awesome your responses are and how absolutely fantastic I have felt today because of them. You made me smile from ear to ear the whole day. I would marry you all if I could.

We are both 32, she is 22 weeks pregnant. Yesterday morning she was  complaining of a headache and asked  me to go to the store to get some Tylenol for her and when I came back she was unconscious on the bathroom floor. I called 911, the ambulance came and they tried to get my wife to respond and to breathe for almost an hour before we went to the hospital. At the hospital they discovered that my wife had a fluke random type of blood leak into the centre of her brain and that there was so much blood and damage that it is not reversible. My wife is now essentially legally brain dead. They performed a surgery on my wife's brain to drain some of the excess blood from her brain and now they are going to try and keep her body alive for four more weeks; The thought process behind this is that if they can keep her body alive and growing our child until she is 26 weeks pregnant it will give our unborn son a 60 to 80% chance of surviving a C-section that time. Her family and my friends are all very supportive and all think that my wife would want me to try and give our child the best life possible so that's what I'm going to try and do assuming that all goes well and I actually get to meet him. If the C-section is successful of course my son will then spend the next 15 weeks in the hospital under intensive care until he is ready to be released to me. \n\nIt's likely today that they will declare my wife legally brain dead. I can go visit her as much as I want over the next 4 weeks (hopefully it's 4 weeks and this all works) but my wife is essentially gone. \n\nUgh. I don't know what to do or think. She is my rock. She does everything for us and I can't believe I won't get to talk to her again and now if this works, our son will grow up never meeting his wonderful mother. \n\nAny advice on how I can try and stay strong, and anything you think I should be doing?

He's been having ringing in his ears lately, among other health problems, that we're pretty sure has to do with the current allergy season. It's driving him crazy, and I told him I had extra behind the counter Sudafed (I get crazy bad sinus problems) and told him I'd give him some to see if it helps. I also got him a sinus rinse kit, some hand cream because the backs of his hands are dry and keep splitting and bleeding, and a gift card to Starbucks because he loves coffee. He's already been to very non helpful doctors who literally gave him Google print outs for his symptoms. \n\nBut, I'm nervous about doing it. :/\n\nI'm a very caring person and this is something I would also do for my friends, but I guess I'm second guessing this time because I really like him.\n\n**Edit:**\nYes, I know where he lives and I've been to his house a few times before. Lol.\n\n**Edit #2:**\nWell, I did it! I messaged him on my way there that I was bringing him the meds and such, because I felt really awkward about just leaving it on his doorstep and then sending a message after. At first, he was telling me not to and that I should wait until we actually hung out, so I replied back, \"Lul, I'm already driving.\" I messaged him when I got there that I was dropping it off, and then the door opened and there he was. -_- \n\nI couldn't make a fast escape because his mom was there and they were both insisting I come inside. He was very appreciative and kept thanking me, whilst also telling me he felt bad because I drove over there.\n\nEnded up hanging with him for a couple of hours, but he seemed excited to see me.\n\nI don't think he's used to someone else taking care of him, since his personality is similar to mine and he prefers to take care of people. I told him to suck it up and get used to it. Got lots of hugs and thank you's though. :)\n\nThanks guys! \n\n**Edit #3:**\nHoly wow.  Wasn't expecting this sort of reaction from everyone, let alone all the replies.  I was actually sitting in my car when I posted this, debating on leaving and going.\n\nHe's still saying thank you to me, and already bought me 2 more games on Steam.  -_-  This nerd...\n\nAlso, I have actually been reading everyone's replies and upvoting just because you took the time to even write one, good or bad.  Thank you again, everyone.  :)\n\nAgain, **YES, I KNOW WHERE HE LIVES AND I HAVE BEEN TO HIS HOUSE A FEW TIMES.**  And, I didn't mean literally leave it on his doorstep without a word.

Most of them are bad sites, but moderately worse than this one.  At any rate, writers for garbage dumps like Buzzfeed, Elite Daily, Medium, and others have often posted questions with the intent of using your answers in shitty \"articles\" that are mostly comprised of a creatively stunted desperate \"blogger\" in need of money copy-pasting your answers directly into an article.  \n\nWhile we can't get these articles taken down or ban the perpetrators (unless they're stupid enough to use their real name in their username or something), we will find it best to remind you that despite the echo chamber that our sub has become, we still have almost 500k users coming to this sub.  The likelihood that your answers will make their way into the hands of creatively bankrupt flunkeys like this is high enough to remind you that if you are worried about someone you care about seeing your answers on this sub and thinking \"wow that person is a shithead\" even if they don't know it's you, maybe don't be such a fucking shithead.  \n\nI am by no means giving license to those deplorably idiotic scavengers who can't string two words together so they must copy the words of others, I'm just saying that we can't control what they do.  So yeah, you might get published on some website if you give a stupid answer.  If you don't care, more power to you.  If you care, sucks to be you.  Maybe get over it.  Or don't get over it but watch what you post.

I don't wanna be a dick and tell her to go fall asleep on her own, because she'll just cry for 3 hours straight and take even longer to sleep.\n\nI like to play video games and unwind at night, especially with friends. Literally the only time I can play games and talk to friends is at night. I'm growing more and more distant to my friends now because she takes up this time that I'd normally be spending with them.\n\nI've already tried talking to her about this several times, and she'll say she's sorry, and then proceed to start asking me if I want to skype, rather than assuming it, and if I say no, I get the cold shoulder the next day, so I end up saying yes every once and awhile and boom we're back into the cycle where it's expected again.\n\n**Update:** Alrighty, it's pretty concretely decided that I should end this relationship, I totally agree. Now the logistics of *how* I should do that, are my main concern. She gets out of work in about 2 hours (I think?) and I am supposed to be picking her up and we're going to dinner because she has coupons for it. \n\nShould I break it to her when I pick her up? Simply tell her when I pick her up and leave, or should I offer to take her out for some closure?\n\nShould I wait till the night is over to do it? If I do that, she's gonna expect sex, and I am not about to do that with her with this on my mind, that's just wrong. She will wonder what is up, and probably immediately resort to crying. \n\nI could also be a dick and do it over the phone.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n**Update 2:** Go figure, she had a co-worker walk out and quit mid-shift, so they asked her to stay until close. \n\nAs a result, I ended up not seeing her, but I straight up told her I was gonna play games with friends and I might go to bed early. She whined for a few minutes but I stood my ground and she said \"alright\" and we proceded to not talk for the rest of the night besides saying good night.\n\nNow I don't know what to do, because she actually respected my space for once. Is there a light at the end of the tunnel, or is this just another false positive?\n\nI will be seeing her at 2 today regardless because we have an event at college we're both required to be at.\n\n**Update 3:** So I went against the Reddit hive mind's decision to dump her. I had a very long and serious discussion with her and instead of crying immediately, she actually talked for once. I *think* I got her to realize that shit needs to change, and it needs to change fast. Now, this *has* happened before, and nothing came of it, so I brought that up, and I was promised change on her part. I'm giving her this week to go see our college's counselor with me and see if we can figure out how to make things work. If by the end of this week, there's no hope, then fuck it.

I'm tired and pissed. Will elaborate tomorrow morning.\n\nEdit #3: Here's the story: I show up at the coffee house/bar waiting for her and she turns up 30 minutes late. When she finally arrives, the first thing she says is that she pregamed before meeting me. Not the best way to start the date but here goes:\n\n* Ask her if she wants something else to drink (makes sense to ask right?) *Are you implying that I'm an alcoholic?!?!*\n* After that awkward exchange, we get to talking as our coffee gets ready. Immediately brings up that she got kicked out of her ex's apartment and that he is seeing an older woman who works as a teacher\n* Called her mom trash at one point\n* She talked about how her ex spread lies about her and I responded with a joke about \"fake news\" She immediately asked if I was a Trump supporting pig (her exact words)\n* Have awkward talk/argument about the \"fake news\" meme\n* After I convince her I am *definately* not a fascist, she talks about how she has never orgasmed. I don't know HOW we got to that subject.\n* Try to change the subject to something chill like music and had the *GALL* to ask her if she knew about music outside EDM (which we had talked about alot through text) She promptly took my question the wrong way as me being sexist and presuming she didn't know shit about music.\n* Any question I asked was mostly taken in bad faith.\n* After 2 cups of coffee and some pastries she decides that she wants alcohol NOW even though she refused my offer before claiming that she wasn't an alcoholic.\n* Give her credit, she finished 4 glasses of Sweetwater IPA. I only had 2. Also I had to pay for everything because I'm stupid.\n* As she got tipsy, she decided to let me know that Linda Sarsour is a bad bitch. Demanded that I agree with her. I have Jewish friends so I said no.\n* I fucked up by saying that\n* She asked if I was privy to the whole social justice thingy. That conversation got really loud on her end.\n* I'm pretty sure she tried to say \"don't be a tio Juan\" but she was too drunk to say the words correctly.\n* At the end of the date, I offered to drive her drunk ass home and she got mad and told the poor server that I was acting predatory. \n* I made sure all tabs were closed and left.\n\nPS I got called a rapey fuck boy on twitter\n", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 964626, "post_title": "I scored a date.

Apparently, a large enough percentage of women hate being approached in the grocery store that this is seen as a bad idea (I'm still trying to figure out why because this doesn't bother me personally, I actually get some really good dates from meeting fellows at the grocery store). \n\nNow, I'm not trying to bash the ladies nor am I saying that they don't have a right to avoid men for whatever reason (~~CK Lewis~~ Louis CK once said that there was no greater threat to women than men, though I haven't seen any legitimate statistics to back this up, so I don't quite buy it....I'd be willing to bet it's traffic accidents or heart disease, not men). \n\nHowever, if women are going to pretty much shut down every avenue for approaching them (bars [\"I just want to hang out with my friends\"], clubs [\"I just want to dance!\"], bookstores [\"Don't interrupt my reading!\"], grocery stores [\"I HAVE to go here, don't bother me.\"], classes/workshops [\"I'm here to learn, only!\"], etc), what avenues ARE available for meeting women organically (eg. not via dating website/match-makers)?\n\nAs a woman, this is really weird to me and I have no idea what to do with it. If faced with this kind of backlash, honestly, I'd probably just give up. Go buy a black Maserati Quattroporte, fill my house with shiny tech toys and an extensive scotch collection, and go full-on bachelorette mode with hairy legs, a stock-pile of batteries, and a fridge full of take-away. \n\nSo therein lies the question: **How/Why do you not just give up on the whole dating scene? Why do you continue to try to date in the face of all these blocks?**\n\n\n**Edit:** misspelled/flipped the comedian's name like a derp.\n\n**Edit 2 (2/26/14):** I didn't really expect this to blow up like it did. I can say that as of 6:15ish EST, I did read *each and every* comment (and will read the new ones after that when I get done helping my bro pack his shit so he can abandon me for a warmer climate). I'm honestly floored by the variety and depth of the responses. A lot of you shared what I felt was incredibly personal insight into your POV, and I really appreciate that, even if it's from behind the relative safety of anonymity. Thank you. \n\nI didn't really have a purpose for this thread other than, \"why do these guys keep putting themselves through this crap?\" But y'all have shared so much more than that. Like I said, I'm truly floored and appreciative.\n\n**Edit 3 (2/27/14 8:00 PM EST):** This post has gotten me a surprising number of really nasty messages and incredibly appreciative messages, and it came to my attention that it has also gotten big enough that the r/AskWomen subreddit has taken notice and devoted a thread to it. Regardless of the hatemail and disparaging remarks on the other subreddit, it's the number of thank you messages I've gotten that make me glad I posted this in the first place.\n\nAs of the 2,032 comments currently on this thread, I've read them all and tried to reply where I felt I could or where I must. Some of your stories are absolutely heart-wrenching, and I can't even begin to fathom what you've gone through. I am sorry you have had to deal with that kind of pain and discouragement in your life. \n\nI also really am glad for those of you who continue to pursue love and relationships despite all of the roadblocks and hazards. Like I said before, I'm grateful for all the stories and comments you all have posted here and messaged me with privately. Empathy can be difficult for someone who's not in your shoes, but sharing your stories does help those who might not otherwise understand. \n\nI hope, and maybe it's too arrogant of me to hope this, but I hope that maybe this thread has normalized some of the things you might be feeling. I like to think there's something reassuring about knowing you're not the only one with your struggles. Maybe some will take comfort in knowing they're not alone in giving up and others the strength to continue.", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 964626, "post_title": "How do men not just give up?", "post_ups": 1762, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1z08ib/how_do_men_not_just_give_up/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:30.868863", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "FlyingPotatoSaucer", "post_created_utc": 1494607762.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "6ash35", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 136, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1755, "post_selftext": "It feels even better if you add a Mutombo finger wag after", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 964626, "post_title": "Why does it feel so good to block little kid's shots in basketball?", "post_ups": 1755, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/6ash35/why_does_it_feel_so_good_to_block_little_kids/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:30.868863", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "AGGRESSIVE_GAY", "post_created_utc": 1531389988.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "8y8f33", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 234, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1758, "post_selftext": "", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 964626, "post_title": "How would you react if your partner wrote you a letter explaining that they were turned on by \u201cmole play\u201d and that they really really want to, paint the bedroom walls black, buy a couple of hyper realistic mole suits, turn out the lights and get \u201csubterranean on your ass\u201d?", "post_ups": 1758, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/8y8f33/how_would_you_react_if_your_partner_wrote_you_a/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:30.868863", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "nosandwiches", "post_created_utc": 1386254378.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1386302828.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "1s5ud1", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 109, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1752, "post_selftext": "I'm not getting a lot of Askmen on my front page.

Lately I've been struggling to enjoy myself around them, the things I used to find fun I just don't anymore. I feel like this isn't good because at their core they're good people, I just don't find myself enjoying what they call a good time. I have an interest in new hobbies that they don't have an interest in, and are pretty content with living the same life they've been for years. As a group when we have conversations they don't have much depth or relevancy to much of anything and it's mostly just insults and mocking that they find funny and I don't. I try to find it funny but I just can't. There was a time in the past where I did, but now I don't, and this change hit me suddenly over the past few months. In a nutshell I feel like I'm growing and they're not. I don't want to lose them as friends, but I'm wondering if it's best for me to limit the time I spend with them and pursue new paths and new friendships?

Your personal growth should never be held back by anybody. An important point to add, if they\u2019re solid friends, never let them go, just accept the fact that you might not see them as often or maybe the dynamic has changed. This is what I\u2019m taking away from it.. they\u2019ll always be there for me, and I\u2019ll always be there for them. However, I\u2019m no longer going to feel obligated to spending day after day with them, it\u2019s time I meet some new people and broaden my horizons.

He seems tired, I think his *spinning* class wore him out this morning.\n\nUpdate 2: I put him in a Clif bar box I found. He seems cozy in there. I'll add some grass and what not when I get back from lunch. Turns out he enjoys Elton John so I've been playing that for him.\n\nUpdate 3: Put some grass and flies in there for little Gonzalo. Will try to get pics later. Changed the tunes to the likes of Led Zeppelin. We'll keep going with this classic rock selection and see how much he enjoys it. Gonzalo said earlier: \"It *bugs* me that they don't make them like they used to,\" when asked what he thought of classic rock. I think we'll be good friends.\n\nUpdate 4: Played Led Zeppelin IV for him, he really liked that one. He complimented me on my music choices. Started playing something completely different, Fleet Foxes, and I think it's slowly growing on him. Going to buy some edibles for us to eat after work, he seems the type to enjoy getting high.\n\nUpdate 5: Came home from work. Gonzalo was still chillin like a villain. He hadn't eaten any of the flies yet, but I think he did drink up the soaked cotton ball. He still seems pretty hung up on the ex though, so I'm taking him with me to my coworker's to get really drunk and help take his mind off things. More updates to come! (and hopefully pics, but I never use imgur or anything)\n\nUpdate 6/Final: So, went to coworker's, smoked a ton and watched Archer and Rick and Morty. I fell asleep with Gonzalo in his room on the table. I woke up around 4 am and went to check on Gonzo, and he was gone. $20 was missing out of my wallet, but a note saying \"appreciate everything. so long and thanks for the flies\" was tucked inside. I'm at a loss for words because I never got to say goodbye. He talked about leaving again but I thought that was just the THC talking... I guess I was wrong. He was too good for this town, and maybe one day our paths will cross again. *cue Don't You Forget About Me*\n\nEdit: still don't know what kind of spider it was, all I know is that it's small and dark brown. It likes classic rock, and has a good tolerance for THC. Also enjoys watching 90s sitcoms, so if you know any species of spider that matches that description, let me know.", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 964626, "post_title": "Guys, I woke up and saw a spider on the covers.

Although I don't consider myself an extremely religious person nowadays, I did grow up in a religious environment and this one idea of virginity has kinda stuck with me. I don't feel oppressed in any way, in reality I all for sexual expression and freedom. But I find my virginity important to me. However, I'm not going to lie, reddit has had me a little scared because it seems like most people here believe being a virgin until marriage is a horrible idea that just sets everyone up for failure because the couple does not understand their sexual compatibility (I can understand this but I don't know if its always true).\n\nAnyways, my main question is, do you guys think any guy will ever want to get involved with me? I see so many guys I am interested in, and my friends tell me to go and talk to them but I am always hesitant because I don't want to get interested in a guy and then have him maybe like me back, only to know that the relationship may not be as physical as they hoped. Don't get me wrong, I am a very very sexual person in my head but sex (including oral) is just something I am not comfortable with yet and I don't want to trick people and string them along, that would make me a horrible person. I think, maybe one day I'll find a guy who will want to be with me just cause I'm awesome but then again, I don't know how great of a person I am. People say I'm funny/cool but is that enough to make a sexless relationship work? I'm lonely and I would love the type of companionship you get in a relationship. But I never move forward with these crushes just cause I know nothing will come of it. Maybe something will but then again, how do I bring this up with a guy? Obviously it would be weird to do so on a first date, right? I keep telling myself to go with the flow and chill out and then things will work out. But I can't help but feel a little bit sad/lonely/pressured since everyone around me is in relationships.\n\nsorry this is so long!\ntl;dr: I want to wait till marriage to have sex. I would be ok, possibly, with doing other things until then (oral) but even then I dont know because this is all so new to me and I'm trying to understand my boundaries. I feel like a shit person because I want to be in a relationship with people and I have the opportunity to but I don't want to burden them with all this and string them along.\n\nedit: I guess I also want to know, is it OK for me to go out on dates with a guy and not talk about it right off the bat?

When I got there his roommates were leaving, he introduced me to them, they asked if we wanted to go out with them, I politely declined because *\"Hey, I have stuff to do here!\"* (didn't say that out loud, just in my head thankfully). Then he took me to his room to pick a DVD together (the room smelled like fresh laundry, really nice). I took a look at his shelf full of DVDs, but I pretty much had seen all of them so I asked if he had any preferences ,he told me he didn't and that we didn't have to watch a movie if there was nothing interesting (*ding ding ding jackpot*). We ended up just laying on his bed talking about random stuff, making out and basically dry humping. At some point my panties were drenched, so I put my big girl panties on and told him what I wanted to tell him, which was basically \"I really like you, I like this, but I'm a virgin and I've never done anything like this before but still, I want to suck your dick\" (not literally, but this was the tl;dr). I was REALLY nervous, but he was reaaally nice, he told me that he didn't want me to feel pressured to do something just to please him, that we can take things slowly if I felt uncomfortable, obviously all the nice talk just made me want to do it even more! \n\nSo I DID IT. It was weird taking his pants off and holding his dick in my hands for the first time, but it felt natural to just...put it in my mouth. I'm not going to go into detail, but I just tried to follow some of the tips I read online (the basic stuff) and I think it didn't went terribly. At some point I felt his hands on my head and I thought \"omg, he's going to push my head and this will not end well\", but he was just playing with my hair and giving me head scratches (soooo nice). He came after a while (something like 10/15 minutes, thankfully because I was getting tired), I hadn't really thought about what I was going to do when he came, but there in the moment I had his dick in my mouth, he said he was going to come and I felt it would ruin the moment if I took it out. I ended up swallowing because it was easier and faster than figuring out wtf I was going to do with it.\nHe seemed happy at the end and I got a lot of kisses and cuddles so I'm gonna put it in the mind folder of positive experiences. \n\nTL;DR: Nice guys don't finish last, nice guys get blowjobs.\n\n**Edit:** Guys, GUYS.

I've had it happen at work twice and I just feel awful about it. The first time I experienced it I was sat down and the boss just went through a list of ~20 things that I basically suck at. By the time we got to the end of the list, I was full pledge crying. You know, like a baby. \n\nToday I experienced something similar at work. I work for a new company, and a bunch of information didn't get passed around correctly. We had a huge job to replace a few projector screens and a bunch of equipment to control it. Someone up the food chain made a mistake and we got the wrong screens. We finished all the work we could do and went back to the office. Upon getting back to the office I went to talk to the design person and asked them what was going on. Upon entering my bosses office to talk to him about the day, he just exploded and started cursing. He yelled at me for me not telling him anything (which I came to do) and I just couldn't help but cry. \n\nI feel that it's because i'm already upset about the day, and I start to be blamed for things not going right. I understand that i'm an adult (26) and people get yelled at...but I just don't want to cry when shit like this happens. Is there something I can do on my own to help stop that reaction, or is it something I need professional help with?\n\n\nedit/\n\nThanks for everyone's comments, thoughts, and ideas they've shared with me over the past day.

Well either she was attempting to move in to strike or come in with a surprise takedown (she says she doesn't remember) and timed it wrong and I caught her flush on the jaw. Her legs immediately went limp and she flopped to the ground completely unconscious.  I immediately knelt down next to her and started calling her name trying to wake her up. She finally came to after about a minute and was out of it. She knew her name and where she was but had no idea what happened so I took her straight to the ER and got her checked out. Doctor said she had a concussion but she'll be okay, just needs to rest and take it easy. I can't shake this guilty feeling though. I know it was a total accident and I'm not a bad person for what happened, but it still feels bad. She's been knocked out two other times during her combat sports career so it's not new to her and she's been totally cool about it joking around about it and all that.

I know it's been a long time, but I thought it would be fun to update you. \n\nI'm twenty four now, and \"Liam\" and I have been together for almost a year and a half. We are currently living together in our own place. We went out for dinner last month with some friends, and our friend \"Jack\" asked if we would be engaged by Valentine's Day. Liam did a quick nod but I saw it out of the corner of my eye. So there's that ;)\n\nIt's funny how much you change in your early to mid twenties, even in such a short period of time. Looking back on my post feels like an entirely different person wrote it. Liam and I have been so happy and content with our relationship for a while now. He is the love of my life. \n\nAND I'm back in school, we're saving up money and having the time of our lives.

She didn\u2019t suspect he was a creep, though she says he had made one strange comment to her one time. \n\nAnyways back to that night. She went over to the coworkers apartment expecting others to be coming as well. She told me that even if no one else came, she would have been comfortable since she thought she knew him well.    She had a glass of wine and that was the last thing she remembered until she woke up naked in his bed at 5 am. She quietly left and had vomit all over her shirt. She never spoke to the guy after this, and he moved away two months after that night. My wife went to the doctor two weeks after to make sure she was okay, she was on birth control already and didn\u2019t have any STIs. \n\nTo further complicate things, she doesn\u2019t know if he drugged her wine or if her anxiety medication interacted with the alcohol ( which I\u2019ve seen before in her to make her throw up and pass out). Either way she was not conscious when it happened. She did not tell the police or anyone else but a counselor. \n\nI am so mixed up I don\u2019t know how to react. I have told her this was not her fault and I\u2019m very sorry it\u2019s happened to her. But I\u2019m angry she didn\u2019t tell me right away and I\u2019ve been encouraging her to talk to the police. If this person still lived close by I think I would actually kill him I\u2019m so mad. \n\nJust the thought of her being with another guy (even if she doesn\u2019t remember it) makes my stomach turn. I haven\u2019t been able to sleep from these mixed up emotions. We had been dating for 6 years before getting engaged (started a year after high school), and were both virgins. We were both the only ones each other had sex with, which saddens me deeply that this is no longer the case. I also feel dirty knowing we had sex regularly after the event (though not in the time before her doctor cleared her). \n\nHow should I be feeling? I\u2019m so confused. I\u2019ve tried to ensure her that this wasn\u2019t her fault. I just feel so lost. She says she didn\u2019t want to tell me earlier because she didn\u2019t want to lose me, but couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer because of guilt. I\u2019m worried that our relationship will no longer work out. I love her to death but would feel uncomfortable being intimate from now on (based on what I\u2019ve pictured and can\u2019t get out of my head) and don\u2019t know how we could continue with this marriage. \n\nSo I\u2019m asking for help, what should I tell myself, how should I feel, etc?\n\nTL:DR - wife was raped by coworker a year ago and just told me now. I\u2019m confused and don\u2019t know how to feel. Help me.

Virtually everyone agree'd that this lady was nothing but trouble but in all fairness, I should have included a little bit more back story to make this less biased against her (although after everything was said and done, I'm still dodging her shit like fucking Neo and Smith). \n\nSo firstly: She's had one serious relationship. From high school. 4 years ago. Her emotional view of relationships was stunted and shallow. She is incredibly naive to social repercussions, as she never really learned to deal with them herself but rather, she always had people flocking for her attention and her affection; I.E. her miss congeniality high school type mentality. She's a daddy's girl and as such, has never actually held down a 'real' job of her own. Her dad actually owned a company that she herself got fired at because she was so terrible at getting along with other people because of her extreme social awkwardness. Her dad is basically responsible for paying all of her bills too, which is why I guess when she skipped out on work today, instead of calling her soon to be boss that she wasn't coming in today, she sent him a fucking email....That I had to type out for her because her grammar was so terrible. Oh, and to add salt to the wound, she also texted her company, which is a landline phone. When I asked why she didn't just call, she said \"I'm afraid of what they'll say and don't want to hear them get mad at me\". \n\nCoupled with the fact that she was raped as a teenager and to my understanding always had a pretty difficult time coping to a circumstance that was extremely traumatic and I began to understand why she said some of the things she said and why she acted the way she acted, or at least I tried to. She also had some really fucked rare deficiency in her body that caused her to lose parts of her hair, resulting in her having to wear a wig. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo the actual story starts off harmless enough. After she suffocates me with pictures of her modeling career and her smothering affection for her pussy (cat), I left from her apartment to mine to change clothes, contemplating whether this was going to be a glorious disaster. So I set up a meeting at Star Bucks and we embark on our journey from there. After some engaging coffee talk, we head over to a pumpkin patch where we win a free pumpkin by catching an escaped rabbit which she dived for like a boss. Pretty impressive rabbit catching skills that she'll undoubtedly add to her resume. We then head over to the mall. Now at this point everything is actually going really well. I am enjoying her arm locking, and calling me \"baby\" and her genuine excitement for trying to be good at her job (even though she totally lied and called in) by buying merchandise for customers she would be selling to. Her job by the way for those who are curious is a Promotions Manager for a 3rd party company that sells event tickets to big games and the like. On our \"date\" she pitched her sale at least 20 times to random stores I was dragged into, so I was slightly annoyed but cheered her on because I was glad she was excited. Her random bursts of social energy would soon start to make me uncomfortable though when we got to a mattress store and after having a sales pitch done on their mechandise, proceeded to ask if they were hiring? And then gave the mattress guy a longer than appropriate sensual hug, this was after she tried selling him a pair of her event tickets. \n\nSo we're still walking around the mall and she asks if I've ever taken Adderall, which I did when I was in college, and then asks if I would like some. I take it because why not, I'll be super focused the rest of our date. **This is important later in the story.** \n\nThroughout our \"date\" she's very touchy. Holding my hand, locking arms, even modeling out new underwear and scrubs she wants to buy. Throughout our conversations I would make subtle references to Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad or It's Always Sunny, and she never understood any of them even though she's my age. Game of fucking Thrones and YOU AIN'T HEARD OF IT??? She didn't even know what The Hobbit was or what it was about. She talked about how she hated reading and was pretty uninformed about current events like Ebola. And she would confidently announce certainties that she had no idea what she was talking about. But her bubbly personality was quirky and somewhat redeeming, so I persisted on getting to know her more. I'm constantly going from \"I like her. She is making me uncomfortable. Wow she is interesting. Man this is uncomfortable. God, what a nice ass. Geez, her stomach is so tight. She has the intelligence of a potato\" -- All sorts of emotional highs and lows packed in a small time frame. \n\nAfter treading along the mall for a few hours and her sharing her excitement for events coming up in our area that she wants to visit with me, we finally make our way over to the movies. We agree to watch Annabell, which is a fantastic horror flick by the way, and that's when the tone of our \"date\" starts to change. So right before the movie starts, I see she's texting some guy and seems pretty distraught about it. I try to ignore it but she's huffing and rolling her eyes and making crazy hand gestures that frighten me. So that's when she says out of the blue:\n\n\"I really think we should just be friends. I don't want to move too fast\".\n\n\"K\"\n\nI'm pretty annoyed at that statement because just the other night I'm pretty sure you were choking down my barrel of unborn children, but who am I to judge. Oh, and her many references to us \"dating\" while speaking to various retail representatives that gave off the impression that we were dating. I really felt indifferent either way because she already had me on the fence anyway, so I didn't plan on escalating.\n\nOK so now I guess we're sitting as \"friends\" now in the movie theater. But she has her legs crossed over mine and is latched on to my chest. Yup, this is totally what friends do. Anyways, remember the adderall I took a few paragraphs before? Well now it's starting to wear off and it doesn't take much for me to start getting sick. I'm feeling really hot and need water, and although I'm not showing it, I can tell I want to puke anytime. I'm feeling like shit and throughout the movie she keeps asking if I'm OK, referencing what she said earlier about us being \"friends\" and if I was bothered by it. I told her no which I think really bothered her because she isn't used to rejecting guys or whatever and having them basically worshiping her to my zero reaction, so she starts to get anxious. \n\nQue the movie ending and we're now back at her place and she's going on and on about not wanting to move so fast. I keep telling her that I completely understand and it isn't a big deal. She states that friendships NEED to be made because that's the only way \"true love blossoms\". I excuse myself and end up puking (because at that time I really do feel like shit, but it literally couldn't have came at a more coincidental time) and now I'm starting to feel pretty awful and not so much as my usual self, so I start talking less. So she then babbles on even more that what she said is clearly bothering me and that I should respect her decision to just be friends. Right. I got that the other 3 times you've made the point to stress. I tell her that if she just wanted to be friends, then sucking my dick and begging me to eat her vagina was probably not the best approach to earn friendship and that the expectation of last night basically threw out any chance of a normal \"friendship\" out the door with me. I told her that after she started texting that guy from the movies, that her tone completely changed. I said if she was still getting over the guy I understood, but I wasn't really going to pursue any friendships she had in mind.\n\nSo she starts to get pissed. Like real pissed. She begins on going on this 15 minute tangent, yelling about how men always do this to her and how she is always fucked over and how I'm exactly the same as all the others. I'm like:\n\n\"Whoa now! You're the one who started calling me baby, and holding my hand, and latching onto me the entire day we've been together, and inviting me over to sleep in your bed to keep you safe. This isn't how a friendship is created with someone you barely know. And if you weren't in the right mindset to date, then escalating our sexual encounter equally is unfair to me.\"\n\nShe then goes on to say how she treats all of her friends like that and that just because she strips down to her bra and panties, that it doesn't mean anything sexual, or sleeping in the same bed as her because she does it with her girlfriends all the time. I told her that the way she treats her girlfriends and the way men perceive her actions, will be received differently, and that her actions are misleading. Men do not look at boobies and NOT think something sexual. You especially don't lay half naked beside somebody and HONESTLY expect them to ASSUME you only want to be friends. [Honestly.](http://i.imgur.com/ZE2ooxN.png)\n\nSo we sit there, 2 days into knowing each other, already arguing, and me having to break down why her view on friendship will not work with me and that the expectations that have been set will make it unlikely for any friendships to happen with me. She goes on the defensive and blurts out how awkward and uncomfortable she is, so I announce I'm leaving and for her to have a good night.\n\nSo then she starts to break down. With her face in her hands she starts crying... Sobbing away. How she doesn't understand relationships and why men don't want to be friends with her. That friendships are the only way for a couple to be happy, referencing her sister and her sister's 3 year boyfriend. At this point I'm convinced her emotional maturity is worse than a baked turd. I briefly explain, again, that although I agree how important it is to be friends, I also believe that natural escalation is also a very healthy part of a relationship. I told her that I'm not interested in pursuing anything that would make her uncomfortable but at this stage and from her reaction, I would not be interested in staying with contact with her and begin to head out the door.\n\nSo she grabs at my shirt and says that she's sorry, and if I'll call her tomorrow. I tell her that I'm deleting her contact information and she should do the same. Although she is a sweet girl with a lot of good qualities, we are on two different paths of life and would not be compatible on any spectrum. So she takes a snow globe that's beside her and tosses it at the wall right past my head, smashing it to pieces. I straight jet the fuck out of there. Trick also left that sweetass pumpkin we won earlier in my truck. So at least that's going for me. Oh, and I didn't pay for the movie, so I'm really happy about having an extra $60 in my pocket. \n\nSo the moral of this story? Don't ever ignore your gut. And if the majority of Reddit says a chic is crazy, she's crazy sauce.\n\n***TL;DR: On fence of going on date with abnormally hot clingy chic which gave me a cannon of red flags yesterday. Decide to go on date because first impressions aren't always accurate and I wanted to give her a fair shot after pushing my load in her mouth yesterday. Have decent date throughout. Is buck retarded on almost all social and political issues. BITCH DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE HELL GAME OF FUCKING THRONES WAS!!! Can you believe that?? Models panties with that sweet crazy ass. Personality is somewhat redeemable, although worldview is very shallow and naive. Calls me \"baby\" and very affectionate throughout date, did enjoy. Tells me mid movie while legs and head attached to me that she only wants to be friends, did not enjoy. I act indifferent. End up puking. She takes my puking out of context and assumes I'm upset that we're not going to fuck. I'm not upset that we're not going to fuck. Claims that we only can be friends and that she only sleeps with people who she is dating and that she admits to moving too fast. I say that shoving my load down her throat is confusing and not realistic if she wants to stay platonic as she can't be straddled half naked around me in her bed, how that isn't appropriate for a friendship especially when I find her sexually attractive. She doesn't understand. I agree that we should move slower but do not agree to just being friends. She doesn't understand. She bursts out in crying. Throws snow globe at my head and misses. Bitch left her pumpkin in my truck we won at the pumpkin patch after catching a rabbit. Didn't pay for shit, now have acquired sweet ass pumpkin. Grateful that I don't have a snow globe on my head.***\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Complimentary pumpkin prize](http://imgur.com/U4iJSWd)", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 964626, "post_title": "*UPDATE* So I've got an abnormally attractive woman acting clingy after one date.

Both my wife and I are in our late 20s; I'm 27 and she's 29. We got married about six months ago after dating for about a year and a half.\n\nWhen we got married, I noticed a noticeable lack of interest from her when we were having sex. We'd still do it 2-3 times a week (which is fine by me) but she's just wasn't *into* it. She treated it like a chore, went through the motions. At first I thought it was just my perception because I keep hearing how after marriage, the love life kind of dims down. Maybe I was just overreacting.\n\nI confronted her about it a few weeks back and she admitted that yeah, she was starting to feel \"weird\" about it. I pressed her for details but she wouldn't say anything.\n\nNow here's the part I'm not very proud of... I went through her phone the next day looking for texts because honestly, I was gripped with paranoia and thought that she was acting a little fishy. Well it looks like there was something fishy. For a few weeks at least, she'd been texting a guy whose name I recognize as her ex boyfriend. They dated while she was in grad school and the relationship lasted about three years. It broke off because he started to become abusive and finally sexually assaulted her. I know about this stuff because she kinda brought it up during our dating phase, but I don't know details since she didn't want to go into it too much.\n\n(Edit: Guess I should mention the texts werent' sexual in nature. Pretty innocent stuff, just \"how's it going\" etc. It still doesn't make sense because she said her ex was an evil guy, but I'm confident she's not cheating.)\n\nSo I talked to her again and long story short: she wants me to act like her ex-boyfriend in bed. She says that he fucked with her mind so much that she has a psychological need to associate sex with him. So she wants to say his name during sex and wants me to do the same things he did in bed; wear the same smelling cologne, say the same things, etc. Otherwise she just couldn't get into it.\n\nI was totally blown away... initially refused and our sex life just dropped. We went to counseling and it didn't really help, though we'll keep going for a while.\n\nFinally two days ago I agreed to do what she wanted. I bought that cologne, dressed in polos during foreplay cause that's what her ex did, and sadly she was completely animated during the whole night. She laughed and was so wild that it reminded me of how we used to be during dating.\n\nReddit, I'm crushed. I hated that night. I've never before had a girlfriend while she's had eleven partners before, so maybe my inexperience just doesn't compare to her previous boyfriends... the thought keeps haunting me. I can't continue acting like her ex, its degrading. But she's made it clear that unless I do, the sex life will be mediocre from now on. We had a fight about it yesterday and currently we're not on speaking terms.\n\nWhat in the bloody fuck do I do now?

I feel like I am being forced to behave in a way I do not wish to behave\n- You have to like someone to message them\n- They seem to be Tinderfying themselves...I tried going with their flow, and just liking a lot of people, and now I am blocked from liking and see the message \"We're glad you like so many people but...Try messaging someone you liked and set up a date\". I did message people and I am still blocked\n\nIn real life relationships, there is something called [Stonewalling](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/anger-in-the-age-entitlement/201212/how-ruin-perfectly-good-relationship-0). Stonewalling is a refusal to communicate or cooperate, and is a behavior that typically leads to divorce or otherwise broken relationships. \n\nNow if you look at the world of Interaction Design (app design) much of our assumptions are based on psychology research. Believe it or not we have relationships with apps. With this in mind it feels like I am being stonewalled by the app, I do not feel like I can express myself within the app any longer. \n\nOne obvious thought is \"Hey! I could do way better if I made an app!\"\nI work in the field, and I would very much like to make a competing app. But I am not sure what the value proposition would be \u2013 and I'd love to hear your thoughts on what you would do different than the options we have today (all trash as far as I am concerned). \n\n____\n\nEdit: My main man /u/fasterfind has a really good point - less images and more words - which I agree with.

Well the advice worked (thanks guys), the double date went great and we started talking more and hanging out etc. But today I came to realize that she tells her friend everything and I mean EVERYTHING that goes on between us. I found out because my friend started to make fun of some of the shit i may have said to her. Turns out this girl tells my friends gf who tells my friend who tells my other friends and everyone knows my private beeswax. Now I can take the banter, that is no problem, but the thing is that whenever I text her I feel like I'm texting my buddy's gf or even my group of friends and that makes it really hard to flirt and text her cute \"cheesy\" shit. Everything we do from now on I know I'm gonna get shit on later from the assholes I call my friends. How do I stop this shit from happening? I feel like there's no future with this girl if this shit keeps happening.\n\n\n\n---\u2014--------------------------------------\n\n\n\nEDIT: holy shit I did not expect this to blow up. I feel like I need to clarify some stuff. Yes I know women share stuff. I know women talk to their friends and that's perfectly fine. I'm glad she's excited to talk about me. The issue here is that the amount of detail that is coming back to me is unnerving. And the fact that the person she's telling everything to is a person I don't really like at all and will use this information to make fun of me to make herself feel better. Many of you have helped me realize that my friends gf is a huge part of the problem and I agree but unfortunately it all ties in together. I can't call her cute names because I will hear about it for weeks. If we end up having sex, the whole time I'll be thinking what she's gonna tell her friend and what her friend is gonna tell my friends. She's too close to my circle and that makes anything I do or say come back to bite me in the ass. Yes, this might be immature thinking on my part but it's something that truly bothers me and it's nice to see many of you agree with me. I know it's not really a relationship but I feel like the situation is preventing it from becoming one and I also feel like talking to her will make me seem obsessive and controlling.

All of his family and friends were shocked. I had been worried about him, though. I didn't think he was depressed, but he seemed much more indifferent to life. He never was a kid who seemed to have much emotion - not unhappy or happy. (He wasn't on the autism spectrum.) He was well-liked, he was ranked #1 in his class of almost 500, he was athletic, and he was attractive (per his peers; I always thought so, too, but I'm biased). He had such a high ACT score that he was able to complete abbreviated college applications, and he already was received early acceptance to some colleges to study engineering. Paying for college was not a concern.\n\nI'm not trying to brag. I'm trying to show that, on paper, he should feel good about himself, and confident about the future. But, he didn't/wasn't. He thought about the world and himself in black and white terms, and I truly think he thought he wasn't good enough. Even though everyone said he was the nicest, happiest kid they knew, I never thought he was comfortable in his own skin. He played a lot of video games in his free time, after school and sports. Video games seemed to be the only thing he truly cared about, and he did share with me that he wasn't looking forward to being an adult. He had his first job this summer, and he said he hated working.\n\nAlso: I did put him in therapy in middle school, because he wasn't eating. He said he thought he was fat; he has never been fat - he had a muscular build. He kept telling the therapist what he thought she wanted to hear, and she didn't see through it, so he stopped. His father was in his daily life, but they weren't close. He was closer to me than anyone, because I did see that he wasn't who everyone else thought. He has a younger sister and brother, and while he wasn't close to them, there were no issues. Friends liked him a lot, but they told me since he died that he never opened up to them. He really kept everything inside.\n\nI am trying to understand better how he might have been feeling inside, which led to him ending his life.

I (23M) have several friends my age who are (for now) happily married. Some of them even have children, and some of those children were even intentional! So if you have found the person you want to spend the rest of your life with already I wish you both nothing but the best of luck and feel about as happy as I can for you given that you are an internet stranger.\n\nHaving said that... whyyy??? Why not just move in together? Why not live together in exclusivity for, oh I don't know, SEVERAL YEARS?

Why would you want to get a bunch of paperwork and lawyers and family and a hard-to-dissolve contract involved in something that is already going just fine?\n\nIn my mind, children and family should be the reasons for marriage, not love. Marriage shouldn't be some big romantic gesture, it should be a commitment between two *straight, heterosexual people* (or two gays, that's cool) to create and be responsible for a real, living, breathing, shitting child. The marriage itself should last at *least* 18 years, if not forever. If you're younger than 25 (ok, that's arbitrary; let's just say young), how likely is it that you're in a position to truly support a child? Can you send him/her to a good school? Will you be able to put him/her through college? Will you be able to support your family if someone gets sick with cancer? Or AIDS? What if they grow up to date a black man? WHAT THEN?

My daughters were both born and raised here however. Parenting in America was not really easy on me or my daughters. There is such a clash of cultures and values that I didn\u2019t know what exactly to do as a father.\n\nI did my best to preserve as much of our culture as we could, I had them take Hindi classes, my daughters both loved to partake in Indian dances, and they both excelled in school. But when my eldest daughter started her college education things started to change. She went to a school out of state, and really partook in the entire American culture. She was asking for money for books when in reality she was spending it on partying and clothes. I only found out about this because of my youngest, whom showed me through Facebook. I told her this was not how I raised her or the person I wanted her to become. We argued a lot, my wife and I essentially gave up on our side. We wanted to preserve our relationship with our daughter, so we took a hands off approach. \n\nI don\u2019t know if American culture might be okay, I only grew up on what I know to be our way of life. So we as a family just ignored that of our daughter, her new boyfriends. I would continue to pay for her college and necessities but if she wanted to exceed and buy money for clothes it would be through a job of her own. Prior to this, money was never a problem in our household. If my children ever needed anything, they just had to ask. \n\nWhen our youngest started going to school, we feared she too would be radically Americanized. However, that wasn\u2019t the case she got involved in the Indian Community on campus. During her second year of college, she told us she he had a boyfriend, we ended up meeting him and his parents. Though he wasn\u2019t in our caste, he was Indian as well had a similar upbringing and similar values. After college we approved of them getting married. \n\nMy eldest, ended up getting a job in California and didn\u2019t speak to us much in general.  My wife was the one whom always had the closest relationship with our daughter but after my daughter\u2019s rebellion my wife stopped talking to her. I ended up being the one who would call and keep in touch with our daughter. She didn\u2019t want much to do with us. \n\nAs time went on my youngest daughter and her husband recently had their first child. For the celebration my daughter came to visit us. She stayed for about a week, and we bonded together as a family. Soon after she got went back, she was skyping with me and her sister.\n\nMe and her have been talking far more now than ever before which I am truly grateful for. She has mentioned to me now that she would like me to find a guy for her, or someone that fills the traditional Indian role. A part of me was really happy to hear this, but as I discussed this further with my wife I don\u2019t think it is in her best interest. \n\nTo us, happiness in life comes from excelling in our careers and education, marrying a spouse with similar values, and having children, for us there was no fleeting romance, our fiery lust. There has a been a deep love over time between me and my wife, but not quite like the American way of doing things. Over time we have grown more accepting and understanding of the culture, and we have come to terms with our daughter\u2019s decisions. \n\nI don\u2019t think our daughter would be a suitable person for this type of marriage. She has already had plenty of relationships, and If I had to bet she has had sex. She loves to socialize, drink, go to bars. I don\u2019t doubt that there is a guy out there that she could end up with, however I don\u2019t think I will be one to find such a guy in the traditional Indian community. \n\nThis leads to my dilemma. My daughter has requested, that I help her look but what exactly do I tell her? I know it took a lot coming to me, to ask for dating helps. I don\u2019t want to reject her in a way that will distance her from our family, but at the same time I don\u2019t want her to get into a life that isn\u2019t going to be enough for her. And I personally don\u2019t feel comfortable expunging details about her past to a future partner. At least for marriage, if a man or a woman has drunk alcohol or touched chicken, can cause all sorts of problems when going through marriage. It's not to say that there aren't Indian men, that don't share Western Values, but they often aren't the ones looking for an arranged marriage either.\n\nI know our culture seems strange to many of you, but please keep it in mind when you are responding to my post. \n\n-\tThankyou. \n", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 964626, "post_title": "My daughter is coming to me to help me find her a husband.", "post_ups": 1086, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/237b11/my_daughter_is_coming_to_me_to_help_me_find_her_a/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:37.971294", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Reformed_Monkey", "post_created_utc": 1511793299.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "7fvjwo", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 292, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1081, "post_selftext": "A little background.

We hit it off, I had to leave, we exchanged numbers and that was that. I get a text out of the blue a few days ago from her so we get chatting and set up a date for dinner last night. This is when I specifically said that due to my belief, we should split the bill. I stated that at this point we were two strangers and this wasn't a romantic date. She completely agreed, multiple times, that she was fine with it and we'd split the bill. \n\nDate night rolls around, we meet up a few blocks away from the restaurant and decide to get a cab. I've been the victim of the \"I left my purse at home/in the car\" line before, so I asked her if she had everything before we got in and she said she did. The meter comes to $8, so I asked her since I only had a $5 if she wouldn't mind paying the other $3. She agreed and did so by card. So we're in the restaurant now and she is constantly ordering the most expensive item. I mean constantly. When asked what to drink, she orders the most expensive bottle of white, saying \"I've never tried this one before! and giggling.\" I'm cool, we're splitting the cheque. No issue. She orders the most expensive starter, followed by the most expensive main (as well as a glass of red to compliment the meat) and finally a dessert. \n\nThe total comes to around $180. My food and half of the bottle of wine came to around $50, while hers came to $130. But you know, that's cool. I'm gonna stick by my word. I put down $100, more than half but that's all fine with me. She doesn't look at it or anything. After about 10 minutes of her obviously avoiding the subject, she asks, \"uh, I think the bill was a bit more than 100.\" I smirk, tell her that we've agreed to split it, at which point she asks me if I was \"actually serious\" before saying \"I don't have my purse on me anyway.\" I see what's happened. I smile at her, tell her I apologise for bringing it up, and say that I've left my card in my coat so I'll go over to get it. I pick up the $100 from the table. I walk over, grab my coat, and tell the waiter that I've pulled over that I need to leave and would like to pay for my half of the bill for the table I was at, and pay for the $90 half of the bill. I leave the restaurant, walk the other way to avoid her seeing me from the window, and get a cab back home. \n\nThis is followed by multiple texts and missed calls from her calling me a jackass, I'm \"everything wrong with men nowadays,\" and that she'd \"file a police report if she ever saw me again,\" which was greatly juxtaposed with her texts agreeing to split the bill just a few texts up.\n\nMy roommate called me an asshole because I left her there, but I told him that she'd payed for the $3 in the cab anyway so it couldn't be as if she had no money whatsoever. Idk, I just wanted another opinion on this. \n\nEDIT: Wow, I didn't expect this kind of response. I showed my roommate this and we both couldn't believe the amount of different people's perspectives that we garnered.

He knows next to nothing beyond her name.\n\nEveryone sits around, chilling, playing games, drinking etc. I make small talk with this pretty lady, and after chit-chatting for some twenty minutes or so, she suddenly asks me who are the two toughest, baddest men in the party.\n\n\"Ummm.... Mike?\" I pointed to a bodybuilder relaxing on the sofa. \"And Billy.\" I pointed to a soldier having drinks with several others.\n\nShe cups her mouth and yells, \"YO BILLY!

I'm not going to use it for anything other than this thread. Hopefully the reasons for me making this thread will become clear as you read this post.\n\nSecondly - I looked at a lot of subreddits to see where best this post would go. Something about /r/relationships put me off, as the following isn't really a communication/relationship problem. It's something that has effected me right down to my masculinity, and I've been looking for stories from the male perspective and found very little - so /r/AskMen seemed like the right place to ask. I'd really like to hear some experiences of this from the boyfriend point of view. I think that'd help. I apologise if the content is way off for this subreddit. \n\nI'm not really one for trigger warnings, but yeah, some of this content is disturbing and includes sexual violence.\n\n\nOkay. So, two nights ago I get 9 missed phone calls at about 5am. I'd been watching Band of Brothers with my housemates that night, and because I get a lot of emails through from work in the evening, I'd set my phone to silent so there wasn't a constant sequence of vibrations while we were basking in the glory. I went to bed, forgetting to put my phone back on vibrate.\n\nThe number wasn't from a number I recognised, and I wake up to a text message : 'Call this number as soon as you can please'. So I do. It's 8am in the morning (I'm from the UK), and the phone is answered straight away and it's a girl speaking. I ask who it is. We'll call her Sarah (names have been changed, obviously). We'll call my girlfriend Alice. This year, we all finished our final year at uni.\n\nSarah and Alice work at a pub together, and I knew they had been planning a night out together for a while, so they could celebrate before their housing contracts ran out and had to go back home. They were set on it, and Alice had had a rough few months with a close relative dying, she has depression (which had been okay, but not great lately) and her mother had a crisis at home, which of course worried her. They were both really looking forward to this night, just a girl's thing. Rather than go out in London (where we're based), they decided to go to a city an hour or so away. \n\nI'll fast forward to the details and why I'm struggling a lot now. In the early morning, the girls got split up outside a club, and Alice ended up at the entrance of an alleyway. She was then attacked by four guys. Three of them held her down while the other guy raped her. They left her unconscious in the alley and from what I understand Sarah found her and rang for an ambulance. \n\nI've been with Alice almost two years. We're both very headstrong and a bit stubborn, and yeah we've been on and off a lot for those two years. But we've always been mutually exclusive, and our relationship was never one where we needed drama to function. We really care about each other, I guess we're just a bit argumentative.\n\nAlice has been spending most of the time since it happened sleeping - the police didn't let her sleep for ages while they asked questions (fair enough). Then they gave her a lift to one of those clinics where they do all the DNA swabbing and more invasive medicals. After that I think she'd had enough. Her exact words were 'I feel human again' when she woke up yesterday.\n\nI'm a naturally dominant guy. I'm 6'4, muscular, and I teach people martial arts. Our sex has always been with me as a dominant, her as a submissive, to quite a developed kinky level. Now I feel completely stripped of everything. I feel entirely useless, and Alice doesn't want to tell me everything that happened yet (I get that, I know it takes time). But not knowing is killing me. I keep on imagining the ways it could have happened and what they did, and then I get so angry - then I start playing out these ridiculous revenge fantasies. I can't sleep. The other thing is that this guy could have given her an STD - we won't find out for a week I think. Imagining how her life could be ruined if she has HIV because of this makes me feel ill. Also, the fact that three guys helped one guy rape someone, makes me really suspect whether this was a gang initiation thing. Nearly all gangs in Britain are related to drug use/smuggling, and hard drugs promote bad decisions and a lack of maintenance in health. I'd be surprised if this guy didn't carry something. \n\nI know this is a long-haul process, one that's going to take time. My issue is that I feel stuck between two walls - one, blind rage, the other, blind grief. Bouncing between them is making me feel hollow. Alice is being an absolute trooper and seems to be as okay as she can be while we wait for the results. She hasn't told me yet how damaged things are internally, but her ankles and knees are quite badly hurt and she can't properly walk. \n\nAlice knows this has effected me, but I've kept this level of emotion to myself.\n\nI didn't think something could happen which could make me feel so vulnerable. Have any guys here had an experience like this? What, if anything, made it easier?\n\n**EDIT:** I finally managed to get some sleep last night - this post had maybe 80 upvotes and some really supportive and informative comments. I wake up and there's almost 300 upvotes, loads more comments, and messages in my inbox from survivors and partners of survivors offering their experiences. Thanks so much. For those people arriving on this thread, look out for /u/vikingkarl 's comments - they're patient and excellent and helped me a lot. I feel a lot better this morning, thanks /r/AskMen. \n\n**EDIT 2:** This is also an update. I spent the weekend with Alice - shes going to go home for this week we think. Since I was away this has had almost 1000 upvotes and I have too many PM to respond to straight away - also a load of new comments, nearly all of which are genuine and aren't troll. \n\n**Great News** - the police got the report from the clinic and sent the results to Alice. A broad range of tests have been done and she doesn't have the bulk of STIs/STDs that can be checked for at this point in time.. The relief was amazing. We found out about this at the end of the weekend (props to the police and emergency services for working all the time - Sundays don't count for these people). A few final blood tests in a few weeks will give us the final data we need.\n\nI don't think I'll update this thread beyond that. I made this post because I felt there was an enormous lack of 'I am the SO of someone who was raped' material online, and personally, it really helped me to read experience from others in the same position. A few times people have said I've been making this more about me, than about Alice, but I can only reiterate that in my case, **hearing some of the day-to-day experiences that follow such an event has really helped me.** Over the weekend Alice and I did a lot of talking. I made it clear that this weekend was not about me knowing what happened - and the same can be said for a weekend six months away. To be honest, this weekend shaped up to have some really funny moments where we were hanging out, and our senses of humour were on top form. However, she did share a lot of info with me about how it all happened. Although it made me feel sick, and furious, a lot of things that happened in my imagination did not happen to her. Knowing what happened means I can bury the things that didn't. \n\nOne detail that did get me - there were bruise marks on her arm, the imprints of fingers that gripped her too hard. That was a low point - right there, I was looking at the grip the attacker had left. At one point, when I held her, I realised I had my hand on that space, and there was a kind of physical bridge between her, the attacker, and myself, all linked by that fucking bruise. But that bruise had largely faded by this morning and it's not important.\n\nThe evidence the police have doesn't look that great - I think it's no CCTV, confusion about where the assault happened, and only a little DNA. But that's a different can of worms, and again, something that is part of a larger ongoing process, to be tackled as it needs to be.\n\nMany thanks /r/AskMen, this has been a long weekend, and between you all, you've helped out a total stranger.

We were going to move in together and everything but she told me she wasn't ready, and she told me a few days after that, that she wasn't happy and didn't know what she wanted. I think she suffered some depression and anxiety due to some medications.\n\nSo we took a break. I know, a break is never a good thing. But I love her. I didn't want to end things, at all. So I told her to take some time to think about it and if you really don't want to be together anymore that's fine. \n\nSo we took about a month break, we talked a little bit here and there, but she came back to me very apologetic, ready to start over. So of course I took her back, I love her.\n\nBut she told me that while we were on a break, and at her best friends house, her friends cousin was there and he ended up getting my girlfriends phone number from her friend. He starting texting her and talking to her. She admitted to texting him and said she was nice to him but that's it.\n\nSo eventually he developed feelings for her and wanted to hook up. She told him she didn't feel that way about him, and didn't want to take it further. He took it badly and began threatening her and took it further and sent a Snapchat around that said he had been fucking her for the past month.\n\nSo here we are. She swears it isn't true. And I believe her. What bothers me, however, is that this took place when we were on a break. The problem, is that there is no evidence ethier way.\n\nTLDR; my girlfriend and I were on a break. She was texting a guy and he developed feelings for her. When she said she didn't feel the same way, he we t ahead and told everyone  they were having sex.\n\nEDIT: let me make one more point, I believe her because of how much effort he has put forth in retaliating against her and trying to exploit her. I saw the Snapchat. It was very mean, it was your typical response if someone had just gotten rejected. \n\nEDIT 2: after a little research and asking around. I have found out that this guy has issues. He has abused girls before, and tweeted nasty things about them. I don't know if it makes things any clearer.

My bf(29) decided to make it his life mission to make me orgasm. After several months and hard work on his part, it finally happened.  AND I MEAN HAPPENED.  Earth-shattering, body convulsing, out of body experience kind of happened.  As a thank you, I wanted to do something unique and special for him.  So I sent him a singing gorilla to show my gratitude.  Before doing so, I asked Reddit if it was a good idea.  The majority said NO WAY, but didn't really help with a good alternative, so I sent the singing gorilla.  This is the update on what happened next.\n\nFirst of all, thanks to everyone for their input even though I didn't go with the majority opinion.\n\nSo my man went to his friends house to watch the Red Sox v Yankees game (apparently there was no soccer Friday).  I get a text message that said:\n\n*A Gorilla?  Really?*\n\nSo I am thinking, \"ohshitohshitohshitohshitohshitohshitohshitohshitohshitohshitohshitohshit.  I should have listened to the guys on Reddit.  He's mad\".\n\nThen the next text I get says:\n\n*You are AWESOME.  I'm going to marry you.*  \n\nSo I didn't think I would see him until today. But about an hour after I got his text, my doorbell rings.  I open it and by bf is standing there.  He doesn't say a word, he just pushes me up against the wall  and starts kissing me and ripping my clothes off.  It was so hot and animalistic, I thought I was dreaming.  He then picked me up and carried me to my bedroom, where he gave me not one, not two, but three hard rocking orgasms.  He still hasn't said a word to me.  \n\nAfter the second one, I took the advice of some on Reddit and gave him a long, slow, purposeful bj - like his dick was the only thing I wanted and I couldn't get enough.  He literally yelled when he came.  IT. WAS. AWESOME.  We still haven't spoken at this point, other than when he said, \"holy shit\" after he came.\n\nSo he then goes downtown on me for the third time and it was so intense, I literally could not move for about 5 minutes.  I was pretty spent after that one and really couldn't handle anymore. Again, we still haven't really spoken at this point.  I was dying of thirst so I go to get out of bed to get some water and I fell flat on my face on the side of the bed.  My legs just gave out and I couldn't walk.  My bf asked if I was alright, I told him he crippled me, and then he came and picked my off the floor and put my back on the bed and went and got me some water.  As I was drinking my water, he said, \"sorry I crippled you\".  I said, \"that's ok, it was totally worth it.  Walking is soo overrated\". \n\nSo then he looks at me and says, \"so what did you do today\"?  We both started laughing because it was really the first time we had spoken since he got there - it was just a lot of moaning and \"yes, yes, yes, more, right there, ohmygod YES\".  \n\nHe wasn't mad about the gorilla, but was embarrassed.  His buddies made fun of him and said his face turned beat red as the gorilla was singing \"that stupid song\".  He thought it was kinda cheesy, but in a sweet way.  He said it made him feel special that I would want to do something so unique to show him how much I love and appreciate him, and that overrode whatever embarrassment he had.  He said about 30 minutes later one of his friends asked him if he was going to sit there all night with that stupid goofy grin on his face.  He said he told them, \"nope, I'm going to see my girl.  See you fuckers later\"...and left.\n\nSo even though most guys told me not to do this, I am glad I didn't listen.  I wanted to make my man feel special and show my gratitude in a unique way and it was successful.  Although, I will note that when I told him I was originally going to send the gorilla to his office, he got this look of fear on his face and begged me to never send a singing telegram to his work...so good call Reddit.\n\nHe's playing in a softball tourney all day so I am making him and his friends homemade snacks to eat in between games.  I hope when I see him at the field he still has that goofy grin on his face!\n\nEDIT:  I forgot to add, my bf told me that knowing that he was able to help me orgasm for the first time has made him feel like he slayed a thousand dragons.  He concurred with what other guys said on the original thread that just knowing that he achieved what I thought was impossible was enough for him.  He said that he has literally been on cloud nine since and has thought about nothing since.  He's said he's just happy I will let him do it again and again and again.

I really can't just go up to her and be like \"hey you know something I can't smell\"\n \nDo I just roll with it?\n \nHelp me /r/askmen\n \nEDIT: so I'll follow up in a bit with the result. I'm just pretty insecure about it and we're not close enough where I can just mention it and pass it off as nothing.", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 964626, "post_title": "How do I tell the girl i'm seeing I can't smell", "post_ups": 965, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/5cn19p/how_do_i_tell_the_girl_im_seeing_i_cant_smell/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:39.665884", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "PhoneJazz", "post_created_utc": 1471188163.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "4xoitt", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 393, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 971, "post_selftext": "", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 964626, "post_title": "How meaningful would it be to you if a woman (other than family/SO) called you good-looking?", "post_ups": 971, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/4xoitt/how_meaningful_would_it_be_to_you_if_a_woman/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:39.665884", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Lyd_Euh", "post_created_utc": 1507838840.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "75zmiv", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 886, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 965, "post_selftext": "Inspired by AskWomen.

To cut a long story short one of the conditions for me taking him back was that we tried long distance as I went to study abroad from October to February. \n\nI have to say, throughout this time I did see a slight change in him, and honestly my insecurities about the past were the main cause of arguments however, he did still have those abusive tendencies, playing mental games, threatening to have sex with other people, breaking up with me every second etc. He was so good at what he did though, declaring his undying love and other bullshit to reel me back in.\n\nIn January however he suggested he moved with me to stay with me for my last month abroad. Silly me agreed. I paid for everything, his flights, rent, food . Was just so happy that we were reunited. Everything seemed to be perfect, but looking back now the saying 'too good to be true' comes to mind. The day before he moved he begged me to trust him and reassured me all his future plans included him. The last week together he told me he couldn't imagine us ending, he couldn't imagine starting all over again with someone else as we had seen and been through too much together. I was walking on air.\n\nThen it happened, after a really fun night out where I introduced him to my friends, everyone's spirits were high except his. He became verbally abusive after we parted ways with my friends, telling me to 'shut the fuck up' for no reason, with a smirk on his face. Not going into too much detail as it's a long story but when we got back to our apartment an argument escalated. Next thing I know he has me pinned to the bed, strangling me. I felt his fingers pressing down deeper so I reached for his face and clawed it, it was only then he let go. \n\nI was bent over on the bed on all fours in hysterics, screaming,crying choking for breath and he *actually* rubbed my back and asked if I was okay. The only words I could get out was 'you strangled me'. \n\nWithin ten minutes, he had packed his stuff and left, not before telling me I'm pathetic, and that nobody would believe me because he has marks on my face and I have none on mine. \n\nAfter he left I ran for help, police and paramedics were involved, they had pointed out a black eye that I didn't even notice, he obviously hit me before pinning me down. \n\nTurns out he was arrested at the airport trying to leave the country, and questioned but was let go and was told to go home. I flew home a couple of days later to be with my family and have since taken out a restraining order against him. I have had no contact now with him since that day.But I do have a court hearing with him this month to see if it should be extended or if he wants to contest it. \n\nI feel like I should apologize to the people who offered me advise. I literally did not listen, to my family, friends and strangers over the internet and it nearly cost me my life. I'm now left to deal with trauma of it.\n\nI'm pretty sure he is ruining my reputation behind my back,as friends and people who once interacted with me have stopped. I confided in one of my good friends about what happened, and I discovered she has been in close contact with him, going out with him etc and she's claiming she's trying to keep it 'neutral' so I wouldn't be surprised if he's told people I'm lying. The level of betrayal I feel is heartbreaking. I genuinely loved him and was committed to him.\n\nHe was always mentally, verbally and emotionally abusive, the height of the physical abuse was a few pushes and shoves, but this escalated so quickly into attempted murder and is scary how quickly someone can snap. I'm now reading old messages between us and I'm completely disgusted with myself I stayed with this animal for so long. The way he spoke to me and treated me was horrific. That being said, it is still early days and I still find myself to love him. God knows why. I need counselling. \n\nSo hopefully anyone male or female who is in the same position as I was, learns from my mistakes. These people certainly do not change. \n\n\n\n**EDIT: Seriously overwhelmed by all the support, thanks so much. I really appreciate it.

(And apparently some gals!)\n\nAs I promised, I have an update for ya'll and I'm happy to announce that it's a...well...happy one :)\n\nI sincerely took everyone's advice and I can't stop beaming with joy!   I know it's only been two weeks since my conundrum but I started making changes starting that night.  Through many of the comments, I realized that I had serious issues in being able to prioritize my life and this was obviously taking a toll in every aspect of it.  \n\nFirst things first, I am engaging in sexual activities before my husband initiates and I do it with fervor.  I give him BJ's like it's an Olympic sport and I'm going for the gold.  During sex, I whisper to him how much he turns me on, how I love his cock, I focus on different parts of his body and I tell him what I love about it (he has an incredibly sexy back and his arms.....lord have mercy.)  The thing is, I have always thought these things about him but I underestimated the power that focus and words can have on turning me on even more!  He is obviously loving it and he is so much more happier (and nicer all-around) because of these changes.  \n\nOther areas of my life which have been suffering, namely my social life, has also taken a turn for the better.  After I posted a reply to someone's comment about how I didn't even have time to socialize with friends, it hit me hard that this is no life to live.  Even though it was true that I don't have time, and still is, this just told me that I need to reassess things and really figure out who my true friends are.  I have since reached out to them and even scheduled a dinner with them for this Friday.  But, I digress....\n\nAll I can say is, thank you so much to every single person who commented.  Thank you so so much.  I know it may seem hard to believe to some, if not all, of you but you guys truly helped me out in more ways than one; in my time of despair and loneliness.  I was desperate and instead of being cruel and not understanding, you guys provided me with such kindness which in turn gave me the strength to carry on. \n\nMuch love and respect to all.

I don\u2019t think I\u2019m that annoying overly doting gf but it\u2019s a good reminder to make sure I don\u2019t make him feel too cramped\n* KEEP TELLING HIM. I do, every day. I'll keep doing it, don't worry.\n* TREATMENT FOR CRACKED SKIN: O\u2019Keefes Working Hands, Bag Balm, Climbon, cocoa butter, coconut oil, Tinactin, aquaphor (all with bandages and gloves)\n* COOKING or BRINGING HIM AMAZING FOOD (and focus on refuelling and recovery food after his long day)\n* SEX (maybe someone mentioned blowjobs too, I dunno)\n* PLAYING GAMES TOGETHER: games from his childhood, card games, or (even better) video games with him\n* KEEP THE APARTMENT CLEAN (bonus points for nice-smelling candles)", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_subscribers": 964626, "post_title": "My boyfriend works a difficult labour job and comes home exhausted.

I read all the comments and really appreciated all the support and new perspectives. \n\nSo on the advice of many people, I went over to his house a couple of hours ago. He was a lot calmer today and at the start, it felt like our normal relationship again. We then sat down and he said, 'I know i've said it a lot over the past week... but I really am sorry. I don't know what happened and I swear it won't happen again'. \n\nI told him that I believed him. I get how hectic his work schedule has been like lately. I know he will learn from this. \n\nHe then told me that he would make it up to me, but I stopped him. I said that even though I forgive him, and I really truly love him, this couldn't work out for now. I told him that he needed to go to anger management counselling, get back into soccer or start meditating... just do something that would let him stress less. \n\nI told him honestly what I felt - that this job was doing him more harm than good. But I know how hard he's worked to get to the position he is in. If that's where he wants to stay, then i'm still happy for him. But he can't let it overtake his life. \n\nWe sat there in silence for a bit and he said 'that's it?'. I replied with 'for now'. He told me he loved me and that he was sorry. I told him I loved him too. \n\nWe gave each other a hug and I walked out.

I knew her a little bit before we started dating and hooked up with her pretty soon after she became single.\n\nWe have a pretty good sex life.  She wants it almost as much as I do and usually our foreplay includes toys, and sometimes we use them while fucking too.  Her favorite toy as long as I knew her had been this particular dildo that she'd always had as long as we'd been together.  I didn't really think much of it.  Sometimes when things were getting hot and heavy she'd hand me the toy and have me thrust it inside of her while I attended to other parts of her body, as this was the best way to make her orgasm.  At the time I really thought nothing of it as I know a lot of girls can't cum from PIV.\n\nFull disclosure I had always known my gf kept in touch with some of her ex boyfriends that she was still on good terms with and had been friends before and after their relationship ended.  This one guy Tom I knew after hanging out with him once or twice when we were all drinking together, and since she never spent any one on one time with him really I had no problem at all with them getting in touch as I still occasionally talked with girls I dated in college for instance.\n\nOne day recently though I saw on her facebook page that she had been tagged in a photo with tom from another mutual friend in some photo from when they were all together + friends from two years ago.  I was reading through the comments when the mutual friend said something along the lines of \"omg u guys were so cute together!!1 :)\".    Well Tom replied to it with \"lol haha well at least [my gf's name] still has something to remember me by ;)\".  I thought of course at the time they were just talking about the photo, but when I checked again a few hours later, the comments were gone, all of them, which weirded me out.  I asked my GF what Tom had been talking about, about what he meant with the something to remember me by comment.  She didn't know what I was talking about at first but then told me about the dildo.  Apparently, when she and Tom were still together, they had the idea together to make a mold of his cock using one of those dildo molding kits so that my GF would have something to use when she went to study abroad for the semester.  And the dildo was the very same favorite one that we used during our foreplay.  I'll admit i freaked the fuck out at the time and told her to get rid of it that instant, that I can't believe she wanted to be fucked using Tom's cock while we were having sex.  She yelled back at me telling me that I was acting like a jealous child and that it was just a dildo in her collection and that i was trying to control her.  So yeah that convo didn't end well and we kinda cooled off a bit separately.\n\nWe had sex since the argument a few days later though we hadn't used the toy.  When she was in the bathroom I looked at it again though and started feeling mad all over again.  I never really thought about it before but it is bigger and thicker than I am so to speak which of course brought some feelings of inadequacy.  I talked to her about it again bringing it up and told her how I felt about it, that I couldn't help feel that in my mind it was like she was preferring tom's cock to mine.  She told me it was just plastic to her and that the only reason she had it was because like I mentioned earlier she has a really hard cumming from anything else but somehow the shape of the dildo was the best thing at making her cum compared to any other toy.  She said of course my oral skills are even better but that when she is by herself pretty much the only way is using that dildo and not to take it personally, that it's nothing about Tom and all about giving herself the best chance of cumming as possible.  I didn't really want to start another fight so I just kind of kept my mouth shut about it.\n\nStill, inside i'm still pretty pissed.  Am I just acting overly jealous like she said though?  I don't want to come off like those girlfriend's who won't even let their guy watch porn because i've been in one of those relationships and I totally get the control angle.  But goddamn it makes me feel like shit knowing that sometimes when she's by herself she is using that dildo to get herself off.  Like, is she thinking of me, or Tom?  I know she said she thinks of me and what can I say, that she's lying?  Ugh.  So what should I do cause I don't want to start resenting her for it but I don't want to start another fight.\n\n----\n\nEdit:  Wow, so many replies since I left for dinner!

I too often lament the fact that I didn't take more of my dad's advice. I can think of countless examples.\n\n\nWhen I was in fourth grade, I was walking through a Barnes & Nobles during summer break when my dad pointed to a book and said \"Oh, man, I've heard about this one. I think you'll really like it. It's about this kid and he goes to a special school.\"\n\n\"yea,\" I said, \"That's what I want to read about during summer vacation... School\"\n\n\nThat book was Harry Potter... Maybe you've heard of it. I ended up being forced to read it in class, and for a time it was my absolute favorite series.\n\n\nDuring High School, I expressed an interest in writing, and traveling. My dad told me I should start a blog, and that I should write one article every single day, just for practice. It seemed like a waste of time to me. That was never going to lead to making any money. These days, I do online marketing for a living, and I'm all too aware that, had I taken his advice, I would have soon been positioned perfectly to ride blogging, youtube, and podcasting straight to the top. I would be presiding over a ten-year old publishing empire, rather than just getting my feet wet. This one hits right where it hurts.\n\n\nAfter high-school, another book recommendation -- The 4-Hour Workweek -- which I initially ignored, went on to be my favorite book ever, change my career path, and altered the way I looked at life and work.\n\n\nAnd then there was Natalia, the girl I fell head over heels in love with. She was traveling and my dad said, \"Be sure you don't fall out of touch. You want to be on her mind, or someone else will be.\" But staying in touch, I thought, that'd mean being vulnerable; Showing I was interested. Better to play it cool, and maybe give her a call when she got home...... Nope. \n\n\nAll told, my father's advice, if implemented properly, could probably have led me to a very different place in life. Of course, hindsight is 20/20, and a man needs to learn some of these things for himself. But still, I have to laugh. \n\n\nWhat advice did your father give you that you wish you had taken?
