I've been actually attempting to read them all, but for anyone who doesn't want to go through every one of them I will some up the main things I took away:\n\n- If you are planning on getting pregnant in your mid-thirties or later, it is smart to have fertility testing in your twenties or early thirties. \n\n- Staying healthy is incredibly important. A lot of responses about having kids earlier say the benefit would be you and your parents are more active with them. I am very fortunate that I stay active and at nearly 70, both my parents are very healthy and energetic and could probably run circles around most people half their age. I can't imagine if my parents didn't take care of themselves and I had to worry about them passing away soon.  \n\n- Women who waited tend to have less financial stress and feel more patient with their kids\n\n- The downsides seem to be parents feeling more tired and worrying about having less time with their children and less time with grandparents (Sidenote from my experience: I never knew my grandfathers and while my mom has said she wishes I met her dad it was never a big deal to me.  I couldn't miss something I never had.  He died out of the blue too and that's just part of life. Unexpected things I happen and I don't want to rush into kids just out of fear my parents may die. I've talked to my mom about this and she fully supports it.  She's excited to be a grandma some day but says to never rush it just to give her and my dad grandkids.)\n\nPersonally this has given me a ton of reassurance that I won't regret waiting til my late thirties for kids. My parents had me and my brother when they were comfortable and they provided us with an amazing life with financial stability and vacations and I want the same for my kids.  So I'll be getting my fertility tested and will be sure to stay as healthy as I can and not feel rushed.  \n\n", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_subscribers": 856605, "post_title": "Women who waited until you were in your late 30's or older to have kids: If you have any regrets you waited what are they?

There\u2019s this unwritten rule that it\u2019s not ladylike, or it\u2019s wrong, or the guy should go first. The whole thing feels silly and outdated! Women are extremely independent in every facet of our lives, except dating. We wanted to encourage a confident connection.

I also have this honey vanilla stuff that is awesome.  \n\nAnyways what can I do to step my tea game up?  How can I get the most out of my tea, the best it can be, etc etc etc?  How do you like your tea?  What's your favorite?  Do you boil it in a pot like I used to?  You maybe should look into a kettle, they're like 9 bucks on amazon.  Did you know tea is a liquid which makes it different from a gas or solid?  Genghis Khan once married 9 different types of tea together, and now those teas can be seen from the international space station!  I clearly have no clue what I'm talking about, lets just talk about TEA!  LET ME INTO THIS SECRET SOCIETY YOU LADIES HAVE BEEN KEEPING ME OUT OF, WITH TEA PARTIES AND DOILIES AND ALL THAT FANCY STUFF!

So I took out a business card - wrote my cell number on the front and on the back thought that since I was reverting to middle school flirting I would try and be a bit cute with it.  \n\n\n\nSo I wrote \"Will you go out with me? \n\n* Coffee (with a check box); \n* Lunch (checkbox); \n* No thanks, find a new way to walk to work\n\n\n\nSaw her right around our usual place, got a smile and as we got closer gave her the \"1 second\" finger, she slows down and as we approach I take one ear of my headphones out, she does the same and I hand her the card \"coffee-side\" up and said \"let me know tomorrow\".  \n\n\n\nShe was understandably a little thrown off, so I smiled and just said, \"hope to hear from you\".\n\n\nI had resigned myself to the full day waiting game but I just got back from a meeting and had a voicemail on my work phone.  \n\n\n\n\"Hi, this is _____, the girl you handed the cutest note in the world to today.  After I read it I actually said, 'I'll do either' but you were already too far away.  I wanted to give you your note back tomorrrow but feel bad making you wait for the answer, so lets talk soon and find a place for drinks after work\" and then left her number.\n\n\n\n\nSo score.  Thanks again for the advice and with a meeting story like this, I hope something substantial comes out of it.  \n\n+++++ **UPDATE 2** +++++\n\nWent out for a drink last night and we had an amazing time, I'm so glad I went for it.  We had a few drinks, some appetizers and a bunch of laughs.  Had a great non-awkward goodnight and shared a ton of texts afterwards.  On the walk to work today, I came around the corner to a big smile, and was a bit unsure of the protocol, do we both stop, slow dow, etc.   \n\nShe made it easy, I met her on my side of the street with a big smile, she gave me a quick kiss on the cheek and said I looked nice and then \"have a good day at work\" with a wink and walked away.  While walking away I get a text that says \"How proud of me are you that I didn't make-out with you on the sidewalk :)\"\n\n\n**Well done reddit and a big thanks to MOMZIL**\n\n\nI'm amazed at the traffic here, so much so that I'm thinking I need to delete these threads....", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_subscribers": 856604, "post_title": "Update - Passing a girl on the way to work", "post_ups": 1502, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/ywlus/update_passing_a_girl_on_the_way_to_work/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:45.835977", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "iced-torch", "post_created_utc": 1537358447.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "9h4irz", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 412, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1500, "post_selftext": "", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_subscribers": 856604, "post_title": "Have you ever realized you were the abuser in a relationship?

I couldn't get a hold of her initially so I sent an e-mail telling her everything. I will not include my entire e-mail but here is a portion:\n\n\"*I understand he was \"joking\" and maybe some would debate that I am overreacting, but I am astounded someone who had never met me and in a position to hire potential employees would make a joke in any way insinuating I work at a brothel. For me personally this crosses a massive professional boundary and if I were his superior I would not tolerate it for a second. When coming into the interview I was prepared to give him a second chance, but I found the fact that he asked if I was getting married to not only be completely illegal but not innocent in any way. I also found the fact that he was audacious enough to ask that in front of his own equal, yourself, to be rather astounding. I did not appreciate the comments he made on my boyfriend and he has also made some in our e-mails (ie. \"We have no problems with staff here having siblings, but we do not allow them to have boyfriends, sorry about that. (totally kidding)\").*\"\n\nShe gave me a phone call shortly after and right off the bat said, \"I just read your e-mail and I can honestly say I feel sick right to my stomach.\" She said she was \"disgusted that a forty year old man with kids\" had some sort of crush on me. She apologized profusely and told me she showed her superior immediately and he was shocked as well. She related with me about how ridiculous his question had been in the interview and told me she called him out in private after the interview.\n\nShe assured me actions would be taken. She told me she was so proud of my strong demeanour because she herself had dealt with an issue similar to this in her career in EMS. She commended me on my actions and told me she knew I would be scooped up by another service in only a matter of time and told me she could just tell there was a fire in me. She gave me the best of luck, continued to apologize profusely, assured his reprimanding and expressed her shame on behalf of the company.\n\nAskWomen, I will be honest. It took me a couple days to gain the courage to type out the e-mail I did, even though I have been trying to keep a strong face. Thank you all so much for your support. Maybe to some this would be easy, but for me something was holding me back from being completely courageous. I am so happy I wrote that e-mail and the woman's kind words stirred my heart.\n\nThank you everyone here so much. Your advice was invaluable. You are an amazing community.

I said something like \"Hey come on, all girls get *some* kind of attention at bars\" and then she asked me to name all the women who were in our group. I could only remember about 5 of them, and then she pointed out that I had left out basically all of the \"conventionally unattractive\" women.\n\nIt made me feel like a total asshole.

Guys wouldn't talk to them unless they were pushing them out of the way to go to the bathroom. Guys would come chat them up occasionally but it would be an obvious \"wingman\" stunt so the guy's friend would get to chat with the hot girl nearby.

A lot of it was very helpful and it was a self confidence boost to know I was on the right track.  Thanks!\n\nI've never been a particularly emotional guy.  Surely, I know the feeling of love  and I know the joy of a hug from my niece but 6 months ago if someone had told me I'd cry tears in happiness I would have thought them crazy.  As I waited near the baggage claim I had the worst case of butterflies in my entire life.  A first/second date didn't even compare with the turmoil I had going on and as I waited I was able to occupy my mind with every horrible scenario possible for Liz's visit.  Meeting Liz I was greeted with a full on tight hug which, right off the bat, started kicking my emotional butt but then she quickly followed that with a \"I'm so happy to finally get to  hug my Dad.\"  It took every ounce of fake man cough I could muster to hold the tears at bay.  I start with this because it pretty much embodies her entire visit.  Between our initial meeting and her departure I had to use the fake cough, clearing of throat or sudden bathroom visit on more than a handful of occasions.  \n\nWe did a lot of fun things during her visit.  Went skiing, ice skating, saw a Broadway show.  Lots of firsts for her since she's only lived in a much warmer climate.  I'm glad I was warned about giving her personal time/space.  She wanted her alone time and I probably would have been either worried or annoyed had I not mentally prepared myself ahead of time.  We share a common interest in science and wanted to see where I worked so we spent a day doing that.  I know the parents out there will think \"Well no duhh\" but while visiting my work Liz showed a sincere understanding of a few concepts and I felt such an overwhelming feeling of pride.  I was completely taken off guard by it! \n\n\"I love you\" was finally said the night before her flight home.  Throughout the visit I danced around it a bit to see her reaction but I refused to have her leave without hearing the words.  That evening, as we were scanning in photos I had saved from before I left, I told her about how on several occasions I almost threw these away but could never do it.  The box followed this unsentimental guy through years of grad school, medical school and several moves between different states after that.  More than once I placed it into the garbage only to go and dig it out later because I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to our story together.  I took the opportunity to explain to her how I have a 5 year relationship with her in my memory that she doesn't equally share and because of this I need to tell her that I loved her.  I loved her then and I love her now.   As we sat in silence the moments following and I considered how a better man than myself would not have walked away, regardless of what a stupid DNA test said, I noticed her holding back the tears this time.  \n\nSo where does it go from here?  We've decided we're going to see each other monthly even though it's a bit of flying to accomplish it.  She also wants to spend spring break and summer vacation with me and I'm quite excited about it.   After an 11 year gap I'm a Dad again and I love it.\n\nThanks again AskWomen!

There was this guy who was kind of awkward and standing in the corner. He was overweight, dressed in a t-shirt/jeans/tennis shoes combo (at a club, remember). Looked like he hadn't shaved in a week. Occasionally I saw him shoot jealous glances my way because I was dancing with some of the girls on the dance floor. Sympathetically I went over to make small talk with him, and he immediately started talking about how women in this city were \"so damn shallow\" and had no empathy because they didn't come over and ask him to dance. He then went on about how girls have been raised to demand millionaires who look like Chris Hemsworth. I'm telling you, this guy was straight out of a Redditian nightmare.\n\n**2.** The second time was yesterday. I met another guy during a young professionals event organized through a social networking site here. He seemed like a nice dude but not really in good physical condition. He had a double chin, was wearing a Slayer t-shirt and basketball shorts with flip flops (at an event where everyone else was in polos and slacks). He also had food stains around his mouth the whole time. When we were alone we started to banter about how hard dating was, in good fun; or so I thought. He soon started to rate all the girls who had been in our group, on a numbers scale. And he would make comments like \"Alicia's got a 8/10 body right now... But notice the stretch marks on her arms. She's a former fat chick. Meaning loose skin. I swear to god, if we don't tell women to put down the Dreyers ice cream, there are gonna be no hot women left.\"\n\nThe whole experiences have left me feeling rather ashamed of my own gender. If this is what you girls have to deal with all the time, I am sorry.\n\nDo you meet a lot of guys who feel like they deserve gorgeous women while not lifting a finger to make themselves look good by hitting the gym, dressing decently, etc?

And we offer women free beer to just hang out with us. They aren't total strangers either, they're people we sort of know.\n\nWhat are some reasons women would be skeptical of going to a party, and how can I make women feel welcome coming to my house?\n\nEDIT: The whole free beer thing needs some explaining... we usually get a keg or something. So when they ask if they should bring anything, I just say, \"No, we have a keg.\"\n\nEDIT 2: We are college aged so not all of us can go to bars yet.\n\nEDIT 3: I asked for women's perspective's and I got it. I can honestly say I have a lot to think about as a result. Thanks to everyone who responded. \n\nEDIT 4: Finally made it to the front page, and reddit thinks I'm a creep, loser, rapist, sexist, asshole. Go figure.

Over the past few months, we have noticed an increase in questions asking users who have experienced traumatic events in their lives to share those experiences. Talking through traumatic events with other survivors is an important part of healing and we absolutely do not wish to discourage our users from doing so. The entire mod team is grateful that we have curated a space where our users feel comfortable enough to be vulnerable and openly share these experiences, and we take our responsibility to keep you all feeling safe very seriously.\n\nRecently, we have unfortunately seen an increase in accounts from outside of our community posting these questions in bad faith, to mock, argue with, or in some horrible cases fetishize the folks who are brave enough to post and share their stories in those threads. This behavior is absolutely unacceptable.\n\nThose threads have always received extra scrutiny from the mod team, because of the risk to our community if they are posted in bad faith. After much internal discussion between the mod team, we have decided that effective immediately, a user who has been found to be posting a \u201ctrauma tourism\u201d thread or asking users to share their stories in bad faith will be permanently banned from this subreddit. We try not to take such harsh moderation measures right off the bat, instead utilizing a system of removals, warnings, and temporary bans to give users who have made a genuine mistake the chance to redeem themselves.\n\nHowever, given the overly sensitive nature of threads centered on discussing trauma, and the obvious violation of trust and consent that comes with bad faith actors mining our users for trauma porn to be mocked, debated, or fetishized, we have decided that this policy is necessary.\n\nThis policy is in no way intended to discourage good faith posts and discussions about trauma or abuse. We will still be approving those topics just as we would any other, and a thorough review of the topic by the moderation team will be conducted before any bans are assessed. This review will include (but is not limited to) the user\u2019s post history both in this sub and on reddit as a whole, tone and phrasing of the comment, previous rulebreaking behavior, and the tone of any comments the user makes in their thread. \nAs moderators, we are only human (for now) and we do make mistakes. \n\nIf you are banned because of this (or any other) policy, and believe that the ban was assessed unfairly, we encourage you to contact the moderation team [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskWomen) to discuss your case. \n\nAs always, if you are unsure if a topic you wish to submit meets our subreddit standards for submission, we encourage you to message the moderator team [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskWomen) and ask us. We don\u2019t bite, and we would rather help you to not break the rules in the first place.\n\nWe have left the comments open to allow for user discussion and questions surrounding this policy change. Please remember that our subreddit rules remain in effect in this thread, and we will remove rulebreaking comments as we would in any other topic.", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_subscribers": 856605, "post_title": "ANNOUNCEMENT: Update to our moderation policy regarding threads that discuss user experiences of trauma, assault and abuse", "post_ups": 949, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8xqgco/announcement_update_to_our_moderation_policy/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:48.768967", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "longernohuman", "post_created_utc": 1479509606.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "5dpezd", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 858, "post_num_crossposts": 1, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 953, "post_selftext": "", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_subscribers": 856605, "post_title": "Girls: what things guys like to do to each other that you don't understand and hate?", "post_ups": 953, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/5dpezd/girls_what_things_guys_like_to_do_to_each_other/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:48.768967", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "GuruGrendo", "post_created_utc": 1459470221.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1459470810.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "4csxiy", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 412, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 955, "post_selftext": "Dad jokes are good too.

We were in the sitting room and he was overly touchy and feely and kept saying he wanted me, this made me very uncomfortable. I stood up but I think he misunderstood it for consent so he started pushing me towards the bedroom. I kept saying no but he wouldn't listen. He lived on this small apartment where the bedroom was just past the kitchen so as he was pulling me, I used my left hand to grab a knife off the table top, pointed it to his face and told him to back off. I will never forget how scared he looked at me after that. \n\nI think I can handle such situations more maturely today given that I'm older but whenever I remember that day I shiver as things could have gone horribly wrong. \n\nWhat's the craziest thing you have done to protect yourself from unwanted advances? \n\n\nEDIT: I'm sad, happy and crying at the same time when reading all your responses! It's always good to know that you are not alone and I've picked up a few new ways to defend myself :-D. \n\nThanks for all your kind words, the best part about growing up is learning not to blame myself for other people's actions. It happened such a long time ago but I remember like it was yesterday, even his perfume is still fresh in my mind. Immediately after he backed off, I ran to the couch, picked my jacket and left while still holding the knife. I think he was too shocked because he didn't even try to follow me. I ran until I was far away from that place as possible and the floodgates opened, I think it was a mixture of relief, adrenaline and fear. For some time, I felt like it was my fault considering I was the one who went to his place. As a result, I no longer go to a guy's place until like the third/fourth date. \n\nTIL other ways: a strong kick in the nuts, fingers in the eyes, hand/wrist twist, using my stiletto as a weapon, even vomit  :-)\n\n", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_subscribers": 856605, "post_title": "I once pulled a knife on a guy to get him to back off me.

As some had pointed out, this is my first real job hunt after graduating and my instincts are still developing. It really helped to get some confirmation to my gut feeling.\n\nI decided to go forth with the initial stages of the hiring process because it also allowed me to see the type of testing held in this province. I do believe it was a good experience to write the written exam - but what happened in the interview portion shocked me.\n\nIt was him and his fellow female co-worker counterpart (they were equals with the same title). We got through the main interview portion, a scenario, some other questions, etc. The woman really seemed to like me and they were already insinuating giving me the job which is a nice ego boost.\n\nThen he (let's call him Dave) asks me if I know of any scheduling conflicts coming up that I already knew of. Let me just put this word for word, ladies..\n\nDave: Really, no conflicts? No friends' weddings coming up? Or I don't know, maybe...Are you getting married?\nFemale co-worker: Excuse me? What you just asked is illegal. [Seems flabbergasted]\n\nThe woman tried to play it off as a joke to ease my tension but I could see the look of 'God not this shit again' on her face. There was also another female candidate interviewed before me and judging by the woman's shock at him asking that I can assume he only asked me that question which makes me more uncomfortable.\n\nThere is a two day 'test-drive' portion of the hiring process as well and when he asked when I'd be free to complete it, it went something like this:\n\nDave: You're staying with your boyfriend right? He won't mind if you're gone for two days?\nMe: Uh, no.\nDave: Really? Oh, he doesn't sound like a very good boyfriend then does he.\nMe: ...\n\nObviously I'm not entertaining this shit any further. When they call me back to set up the two-day test drive I will ask to speak to the woman and tell her all of my concerns including the brothel comment. This is the right thing to do, right? Ladies, is there anything else I should be doing?\n\nThank you all very much for your insight.

Is it better left without her knowing and having that stress, or should I tell her because she has the right to know? And if so, how do I go about telling her? She's so kind, I feel awful for her. Well, for anyone who has this done to them- kind or not, it's not fair. \nMe and her aren't good friends or anything, I just know who she is from mutual friends and we say hello in passing. \nWhat do you guys think I should do? Please help! \n\n\nEdit: So I have told her, I told her I just merely came across a site (afraid she would get concerned with who told me of them initially), and offered her a little advice on how to get them off/linked her that URL from reddit that was familiar. She seems thankful but is a little short- probably a little shocked and worried about what to do now. I told her I would do anything to help/talk if she wanted to. But as of now she is taking care of it! I'm glad I told her, she was unaware of them- so at least she can do something now!! \n\nEdit 2: So We have been talking and she has contacted the police, and they are ready to do whatever it takes to get the pictures down- it turns out she was 16-17 in the pictures so it really is child pornography. Once she finds out who did it she says she plans on taking them to court. This will prove to guys in our area that no matter what the circumstances- THIS IS NOT OK. I don't care if you're mad at someone or they hurt you- posting pictures that could really hurt someone or cause depression is just sick. Take the high road and walk away.

The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly.\n> \n> I have been remorseful of my actions. And I\u2019ve tried to learn from them. And run from them. Now I\u2019m aware of the extent of the impact of my actions. I learned yesterday the extent to which I left these women who admired me feeling badly about themselves and cautious around other men who would never have put them in that position.\n> \n> I also took advantage of the fact that I was widely admired in my and their community, which disabled them from sharing their story and brought hardship to them when they tried because people who look up to me didn\u2019t want to hear it. I didn\u2019t think that I was doing any of that because my position allowed me not to think about it.\n> \n> There is nothing about this that I forgive myself for. And I have to reconcile it with who I am. Which is nothing compared to the task I left them with.\n> \n> I wish I had reacted to their admiration of me by being a good example to them as a man and given them some guidance as a comedian, including because I admired their work.\n> \n> The hardest regret to live with is what you\u2019ve done to hurt someone else. And I can hardly wrap my head around the scope of hurt I brought on them. I\u2019d be remiss to exclude the hurt that I\u2019ve brought on people who I work with and have worked with who\u2019s professional and personal lives have been impacted by all of this, including projects currently in production: the cast and crew of Better Things, Baskets, The Cops, One Mississippi, and I Love You Daddy. I deeply regret that this has brought negative attention to my manager Dave Becky who only tried to mediate a situation that I caused. I\u2019ve brought anguish and hardship to the people at FX who have given me so much The Orchard who took a chance on my movie. and every other entity that has bet on me through the years.\n> \n> I\u2019ve brought pain to my family, my friends, my children and their mother.\n> \n> I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want. I will now step back and take a long time to listen.\n> \n> Thank you for reading.", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_subscribers": 856605, "post_title": "What do you think of Louis CK's apology?", "post_ups": 793, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/7c3wuf/what_do_you_think_of_louis_cks_apology/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:52.163234", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "slaughtxor", "post_created_utc": 1375753288.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "1js60w", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 469, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 797, "post_selftext": "A girl my friend knows let loose in casual conversation that she does what she called \"The Ramp.\" She explained that \"The Ramp\" is when, while defecating, you partially submerge your hand in the toilet water at an angle so that the deuce hits your hand and then rolls into the water with nary a sound.\n\nShe does this so people won't know she's pooping.

I was at a Halloween party last night that started with a bit of a formal dinner with set seating arrangements.\nI ended up between a guy I didn't know at all and one of my closest girlfriends who's extremely pretty. I'm not, and usually I'm fine with it. It's things I can't change, just being very tall with broad shoulders from swimming and having a huge head and an odd-looking face. \n\nDinner went on and the guy next to me kept completely ignoring me and instead leaning over to my friend to chat with her. At first I thought we were all just talking - but he just ignored everything I said while my friend was getting quite uncomfortable. She asked me to come outside with her to have a smoke. \n\nOutside, we started talking to some other people until that guy joined us. My friend immediately started chatting to me about work and the guy kept ranting that nobody at the party wanted to play boardgames. Another friend pointed to me and said I was the person to talk to about gaming things. He turned, grinned, and said \"God, no, not with that.\"\n\nAnd suddenly I felt 14 and worthless again. I've not felt that way in ages which is probably because I stick to my boyfriend and my close circle of friends and don't venture out with randoms anymore as I did when I was a teenager. But I remember being shoved aside like I was worth less than my friends when I was that age. It's not like I should even care what shitty people think but it's still gnawing away at my confidence.

I'd like to thank Whole Foods, for making the best organic tampons, they were never uncomfortable and they never let me down. \n\nI'd also like to thank Instead Softcup, 12 Hour protection. You allowed me to have some really awesome sex on my period, without the mess and not even my boyfriend at the time could tell I was on my period or that you were allowing us to have a rockin time in the sack-thanks for keeping that just between us :).\n\nTo my ovaries, thanks for being able to stick around, so I'll still want to have rockin sex :)! \n\nTo the men at my favorite burger joint, you have NO IDEA what a lifesaver your bacon cheeseburger was every month and when you started putting rootbeer floats on the menu, I thought I'd just about died and gone to heaven!\n\n\nTo my uterus, cervix and goddamm fallopian tubes. Please know, that although I am disappointed, I know it's not personal. I know you didn't fail on me, on purpose. We're just not a good fit anymore it seems and it's better for all of us, to just part ways. I appreciate you trying all these years, for us to make a go of it but it seems, my body and I will be in much better harmony without you. Sometimes their's nothing to do anymore but to say goodbye. \n\nAnd last but not least, To my future child, should I be so lucky: If I am not your biological mother, I hope you don't care, I hope so very much, that I am enough. If you ever want to go to seek out your biological mother, I can't deny that a part of me wouldn't be hurt but I would still, absolutely support you. I can only empathize what it must be like but I can imagine it's only natural to be curious and have questions that you would want your biological parents to answer. I want you to know though, that whether we look alike or not, I don't give a damm. Whether people can tell or not that we're not biologically related or not, I don't give a damm. I'll do my best to be the best mum I can be and to me, that means giving you unconditional love, making sure you know how loved you are and helping you become who you want to be. I won't ever encourage you to be anyone but you. Even if that makes you the class \"weirdo\" or if you're the most \"regular\" child ever. Whoever you are is who I want you to be. And even though I haven't even meant you and even though I don't know you, I love you already. I'll find you. I believe that if any good is to come out of not being able to have biological children, it's this one thing but it's the only one that matters; that I was meant to find you in this world, not inside my stomach. \n\n\nAnd to close I'd like to steal from the late and great Edward R.

He's 16 about to be 17. I'm very proud of him for a lot of reasons: He's kind and mostly confident. Now, he's asked about girls and we've had a lot of very frank discussions about sex (sex is positive, masturbation is good for you, etc.). When it comes to women, I've explained to him the most important thing to remember is they are people and like all people they deserve the benefit of the doubt whenever possible and basic respect and dignity. I've explained to him the concepts of enthusiastic consent, looking out for others (including men), and speaking out against reprehensible behavior.\n\nI've talked to him about how to \"pick up\" women. Pretty much the \"method\" I've explained is this: Talk to them like human beings, introduce yourself (Hi my name is poisonghost's son) and engage them in conversation as you would any human being. And above all make sure you're a decent human being. To wit, be passionate about something, anything in your life, be confident about that thing, be curious and open about the experience's of others and be grounded in your own space. Don't let people run over you, don't let people run over others. Be respectful of the boundaries of everyone you interact with.\n\nDon't catcall, it's crass. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Don't be afraid to be wrong.\n\nAgain, always seek enthusiastic consent. Always use condoms (no matter what anyone says).\n\nIs there anything I've missed? Anything I've put to him wrong? I'd love any comments or suggestions (crowd source is the best source). Thanks in advance.\n\n**Edit 3: A couple people suggested cross posting this to /r/askmen. Wish me luck. I'm doing that right now!**\n\n**Edit: changed \"womenfolk\" to \"women.\" Was trying to be tongue in cheek. Failed miserably.**\n\n**Edit 2: This kind of blew up on me. I'm honestly humbled and honored to have so much great advice. And I got reddit gold. Thank you to whomever did that. I thought that was mythical. Like the lottery. Or unicorns. (reddit gold is the unicorn of fake internet points?). I'm really going to take a lot of this advice to heart. All of the comments and ideas were appreciated, even (especially) the criticism. All the ideas and comments will be in my thoughts moving forward. A short list of some of the future topics of conversation: Transgender people, managing expectations (your own and others), listening, listening, listening, dealing with rejection constructively, communicating your feelings and again (because it can't be said enough) enthusiastic consent.**\n\n**Thank you for the compliments, to everyone, but again, I've got a great wife who's a big part of my son's life and I've been lucky to wind up with such a great kid. I tried to take the accolades graciously, but honestly, it's a lot more them than me.**\n\n**I'll try and respond to more comments, but can't make any guarantees moving forward.
