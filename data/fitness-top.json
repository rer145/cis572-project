This post does not represent a change in that policy, but rather that we feel the issue of Net Neutrality is so incredibly important to our community and to the world of fitness that we are willing to make an exception to something we have historically been extremely strict and uncompromising about.\n\nConsider some of the popular and highly regarded sources of fitness information that we have today. People like (in no particular order): Greg Nuckols, Alan Thrall, Mark Rippetoe, Jeff Cavaliere/Athlean-X, Cody LeFever/GZCL, our own u/MythicalStrength, Omar Isuf, Mark Bell, Jam Wandler, Brian Alsruhe, Jonnie Candito, Layne Norton, Chris Duffin, Ben Pollack, Megsquats, Eric Cressey, Brad Schoenfeld, Mike Israetel, Bradley Martin, Chad Wesley Smith, Joe DeFranco, Marisa Inda, Janae Marie Kroc. Websites like Strength and Conditioning Research, Examine, Juggernaut Training Systems, EliteFTS, Rogue, Muscle and Strength, BodyBuilding.com, T-Nation, Body Recomposition, Keto Gains, MyFitnessPal, Sci-Fit, Starting Strongman, ExRx, and all the disparate fitness sub-Reddits.\n\nNow imagine a world where the telecom company that owns your ISP has seen that there's money to be made if they jump into the fitness market, and they've decided to launch their own Daily Workouts service, so they throttle or block your internet traffic when you go to watch some of the most popular fitness channels on YouTube, and *there is nothing you can do about it*. What they are doing has been made completely legal. You cannot speak with your money because you have either no other choices in ISP in your region, significantly worse choices in service, or your other choices are owned by a *different* telecom juggernaut that is doing exactly the same thing.\n\nImagine a world where Greg Nuckols can be legally forced to pay Comcast so that their customers can access StrengTheory unimpeded, and so he must either start charging, run intrusive ads, or shut down. Replace \"Greg Nuckols\" with anyone you care to name.\n\nThink that can't happen? [They've already tried. Repeatedly.](http://archive.is/y8e4H) The only thing that stopped them was the FCC - The same FCC whose chairman now wants to dismantle everything that stopped them from becoming this generation's Robber Barons.\n\nThe Internet facilitates the exchange of information between individuals in a way that has revolutionized fitness. It has provided athletes and coaches with a platform to connect with and share high quality training methodology with more people than ever in history. It has lowered the barrier to finding  training and nutrition information. It has helped uncountable numbers of fitness enthusiasts of all levels of experience to learn how to achieve their goals. It has lowered the financial barrier to pursuing fitness by spreading information that dispels myths about snake oil supplements, over-marketed fitness programs, and unethical industry practices. Though there is a dark side to that coin as well, the list of positives and benefits is enormous and their value cannot be overstated.\n\nIt is because of the importance of Net Neutrality to the entire world of fitness that we are making an exception to our normal practices for this post. Everything that can be done to protect Net Neutrality **must** be done.\n\n**We strongly urge everyone within the sound of our voice to contact their Congressmen and Congresswomen to tell them of the importance of Net Neutrality.** The internet is famous in recent years for \"slacktivism\", but this issue is too important to simply share things on social media. I, personally, have already called my representatives and will be hand writing letters to everyone who is relevant later today.\n\nThis website is currently making the rounds and will help you take what action you can: www.battleforthenet.com", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Net Neutrality - A serious issue that cannot be ignored", "post_ups": 29975, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7etjhj/net_neutrality_a_serious_issue_that_cannot_be/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:08.475838", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "iamaliftaholic", "post_created_utc": 1466743965.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1466799386.0, "post_gilded": 2, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 2, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "4pl3yc", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 640, "post_num_crossposts": 6, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 16845, "post_selftext": "I've been seriously lifting weights for eight years now. Looking back at when I first started, I did so many things wrong but it took me a lot of trial and error to get where I'm at today. By no means do I know everything now -- not even close. I finished school with a BS in Kinesiology and got my CSCS from the National Strength and Conditioning Association, and will start my Master's program in the fall. There have been many times where I was dead-set on being right about things, only to later find out I was wrong. \n\nThat's the beauty of exercise and strength training: continuing to learn and grow. You should never be complacent with what you know. Buy books, read articles, ask around your gym. You can only benefit from this. You can add to what you already have in your arsenal and become a complete package. Here are some things I wish I knew when I started 8 years ago. (Disclaimer: this is mainly directed at beginners, but some of these things may be new to you even if you've been lifting for some time)\n\n1. **Just because your numbers are going up doesn't mean you're doing the exercise right.** I remember hitting plenty of milestones in regards to benching, squatting, and deadlifting. However, I would later find out little things I was doing wrong that could have led to injury. Fixing these minor tweaks made the exercises much harder, but I felt much stronger and safer because of them.\n\n2. **Mobility work is extremely important.** After a couple years of lifting, I was at the top of the world. I was bigger, stronger, had more confidence, etc. However, I didn't realize how tight I was, and how that was restricting much of what I did in the weight room and in my life. If you don't know much about mobility, do some research. Thoracic spine mobility, shoulder mobility, hip mobility, ankle mobility, the list goes on and on. Look up people like Kelly Starrett, Eric Cressey, Matthew Ibraham, and others. They all have YouTube channels and their attention to detail in regards to range of motion, stability, and mobility are some of the most useful and eye-opening pieces of information you can find. \n\n3. **Never underestimate the power of warming up.** I see a lot of people walk into the gym, do a couple of shoulder circles, then jump into their workout. I used to do the same thing. However, once I started adding in dynamic warmups and prehab/mobility exercises before lifting, I noticed a world's difference. Consider the exercises you'll be doing that day and work on those areas before you hit the weights. \n\n4. **Compound movements really do trump all.** This was a hard lesson for me to learn. I used to do the typical back/biceps, chest/triceps, shoulders/traps, legs split (which, depending on your goals, isn't necessarily a bad thing). However, once I switched over to Push/Pull/Leg splits, I really noticed a change in my body. Cut down the isolation work. Focus on exercises that will truly challenge your strength, stability, and coordination. Pull ups, chin ups, bent over rows, squats, deadlifts, RDLs, overhead presses, bench/incline bench, pushups, dips, cleans, snatches, etc. Those are the exercises that should make up the majority of your workouts. Find ways to make them harder if you've already mastered them. Not only will your strength increase, but you'll look even better.\n\n5. **The best core work you can do (in terms of both safety and results) doesn't involve crunches and russian twists** Just hear me out on this one. I used to do the usual ab exercises -- sit ups, crunches, leg raises, russian twists, side bends, etc. While these will all work your abs, they do little to nothing to help your overall core stability. Start using movements that will help you in your other lifts (and they will strengthen and grow your abs as well). These movements refer to anti-extension/flexion, anti-rotation, rotational movements, etc. I've been doing these exercises for my core and have noticed my other lifts improve because of them (in addition to being extremely sore the next day): Hanging leg raises, Pallof presses, landmine rotations, woodchops, planks on a stability ball, rollouts (wheel or stability ball), dead bugs, bird dogs, back extensions, dragonfly's, rotational throws, plank slides with gliders, side planks, farmer carries, overhead carries, L sits, etc. A lot of these can be done on one knee or can be made harder by taking away an arm or leg. Basically, any exercise that challenges your body's ability to stay stable has a profound effect on your overall strength and still give you that ab soreness that so many people desire (even though that's not what we're after..but you know what I'm saying). Another note on this: people tend to think of the \"core\" as just your abs. But your core is actually all of the structures that support your trunk and limbs. This includes your abdominals, obliques, shoulder joints, hip joints, lower back muscles, etc. By strengthening these areas, you improve your trunk rigidity. When your trunk rigidity increases, it allows more freedom of movement from your limbs. All proximal tightness will improve distal ROM.\n\n6. **Kettlebells are AWESOME** I avoided kettlebells for a very long time up until these past few years. Talk about a game-changer. Kettlebells allow you to do some crazy movements that'll challenge your body in ways that you didn't think possible. Kettlebell swings are towards the top of my list. Not only are they great for glute strength/power, but it has a carryover effect for teaching proper hip hinge mechanics, and is a great tool to add in for high intensity conditioning. Turkish get ups, windmills, clean and presses, one-armed presses, goblet squats (great for beginners), and many other exercises challenge you in a unique way. If you haven't tried training with kettlebells, I recommend you start now. \n\n7. **Cardio really, really, really does not have to be a drag** I know a lot of people have recently moved away from the long duration treadmill, elliptical, stair-stepper, and biking trend that has dominated the fitness culture for so long. But a lot of people still limit themselves to just that. Circuits and HIIT are truly superior if you want to add in cardio work. Not only is it faster, but it's way less boring and much more fun and effective. Some ideas of exercises to use for your conditioning: PROWLER PUSHES, kettlebell swings, rower intervals, ball slams (both front and side to side), plyometric work, speed ladders, tire flips, mountain climbers, box jumps, sprints, battle ropes, jump ropes, sled pulls (with a rope, working primarily your back), etc. These will not only leave you gassed but also work your entire body instead of just your legs. The possibilities are endless.\n\n8. **Writing out, or following, a detailed workout program will get you to that next level** I can't tell you how many of my workouts in years past consisted of me walking into the gym and meandering from exercise to exercise. Sure I walked out with a nice pump, but how did I know I actually made any progress. When I follow a pre-written routine, I go into the gym on a mission. I know what I'm going to do, how many times, and how much weight I'll use. This really drills discipline into you. Some days you come in feeling sluggish, but if you have a routine set up, you know that you must finish what you wrote down. Otherwise, you'd probably cut your workout short. Having a specific goal changes your mindset completely. Tracking your progress keeps you honest and prepared. Looking back on your numbers and seeing them increase is an awesome feeling. Look into programs like 5/3/1, starting strength, PHAT, just to name a few. Or, if you feel competent enough, write up your own. Take progress pictures. Track your numbers. It is essential for success.\n\n9. **Learn your damn anatomy.** A lot of things really started clicking for me once I began studying anatomy and physiology. Although it may be boring, once you learn about where each bone is, where your muscles originate and insert, how the contraction process takes place, etc. then you will start viewing lifting in a whole new light. Biomechanics is a big one too. These things can change how you lift and help you pay more attention to your technique. For instance, you know you need to keep your elbows back to target your triceps during dips, but do you know WHY? Did you know that your pec actually inserts onto your humerus (arm bone) therefore when you keep your arms close you're essentially taking the pec out of [majority of] the movement? Not only will this help you, but it will help if someone ever needs advice or has any \"why\" questions. Do your muscles flex? Well, no they don't. Your joints flex and extend. Your muscles contract and relax. Find out the function of each muscle, what muscles contribute to elbow/shoulder/hip/knee extension and flexion, and you'll learn a lot of new things. Look up websites like getbodysmart.com which have great illustrations of muscle function and placement.\n\n10. **Nutrition and sleep really are as important as people make them out to be.** I know, I know. Everyone has heard this by now. But I had to mention it. Just google the benefits of sleep if you don't know them, but they are substantial. Nutrition..well, I could write an entire essay on that subject alone but you must, and I mean MUST make this a priority over everything else. If you have your nutrition on point, everything else will come with relative ease. Don't undermine its importance. \n\n11. **Breathing mechanics are important.** This is one that I've really had to learn to incorporate lately. And I'm not talking about the typical \"exhale when exerting/using concentric contractions and inhale during lowering/eccentric contractions. I'm talking about proper breathing and rib alignment. Google or YouTube proper breathing mechanics and setup. 90/90 breathing is a great exercise to use. Most of us here are chest breathers, when in reality we need to be using our diaphragms. This will change the way you do pretty much every exercise.\n\n12. **Film yourself.** I'm adding this one a day late because it totally slipped my mind last night. There's a difference between what you feel like you're doing and what you're ACTUALLY doing. The best way to find out the truth is to film yourself from the side. This is such a big help, especially if you're wondering how your form is. Try to have a friend film you squat or deadlift in slow motion, and watch the video carefully. Look at how you initiate the movement, if/when you start rounding your back, how your head position looks, etc. Or, you can even film yourself doing these exercises in your room with no weight. Although it may sound weird, doing certain exercises with a shirt off will actually show you the muscles themselves moving, and if you do an exercise from a rear view you can see your spinal mechanics at work. It's really an interesting thing to do and will help you spot any errors and correct your form.\n\nThat's all I could think of for now, but I'm sure there's a lot more. I figured if it was longer than this I'd lose your attention (unless I already lost you a long time ago).\n\nLike I said earlier, by no means do I know everything. Not even close. But in order to be the best you can be in the world of physical fitness, you must continue to learn and experiment. Be proud of where you are, but ask yourself what aspects you're ignoring or could improve. Much love r/fitness, I'm constantly amazed at the amount of support and passion you guys have for the subject and each other.\n\nEdit: Some helpful websites and articles:\n\nhttp://www.mobility-101.com/\n\nhttp://ericcressey.com/\n\nhttp://breakingmuscle.com/\n\nhttps://www.onnit.com/\n\nhttp://movement-as-medicine.com/\n\nhttp://www.stack.com/c/training\n\nhttp://fitnesspainfree.com/\n\nKelly Starrett YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/sanfranciscocrossfit\n\nEric Cressey YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/ecressey\n\nMatthew Ibrahim YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkU4ohyN8VMn8UhJ8aeZFAQ\n\nSTACK YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/STACKVids\n\nAlan Thrall YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/athrall7\n\nTodd Durkin YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/ToddDurkinFQ10\n\nMark Rippetoe YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/AasgaardCo/featured\n\nEdit 2: Getting a lot of specific questions regarding what's best for warming up and mobility.

The link is in the header and the summary is below them.\n\n### 1. [Video: How to do Proper Pullups](https://youtu.be/P9knQsSe23o)\n\n* There are two phases of a pullup: The scapular pull in the beginning (with straight arms) and then the actual pullup.  This can be done in one fluid motion but if you take a video of yourself and find your shoulders remain shrugged up *or* if you can barely get the chin-over, you should consciously focus on improving your scapular pull.\n\n* Also, make sure you're **going down ALL THE WAY** and NOT doing half-ROM pullups which are *super* common. Another tip is to keep your feet uncrossed, thighs together and in front of you as it will make you stronger.\n\n### 2. [Video: How to do pullups if you can't do any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLjb-iXpxWE)\n\n* In part two, I demonstrate how to **perform negative pullups properly,** emphasizing *the importance of lifting/tucking the knees up as you lower down so that your feet dont hit the ground before your arms are straight.* Your goal is to do 10-second negatives.\n\n* If you can't control the negative, then you need to work on your rows (incline rows to be exact) which are an easier pulling exercise and a prerequisite for pullups. In the RR, we recommend you get to 3 sets of 8 reps (\"3x8\") of horizontal rows before moving to the pullup progression.\n\n* If you are unsure how or where to do rows, review the video on [bodyweight rows here](https://youtu.be/rloXYB8M3vU).\n\nI hope that helps!

In that sense, both are carcinogens. But smoking increases your relative risk of lung cancer by 2,500 percent; eating two slices of bacon a day increases your relative risk for colorectal cancer by 18 percent.

This is important for many weightlifting exercises, but also for handstands and hand-balancing. It is also important for shoulder health, especially when older. Stand up with a straight bodyline, tense your butt muscles and move your arms overhead. Move your arms backwards without losing the straight bodyline. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=161))\n\n* **[Spine Backbend](https://i.imgur.com/GqJdRKA.png)** | The spine backbend focuses on thoracic spine mobility. If you ever dreamt of doing bridges on the floor, this is your exercise. A good thoracic spinal mobility can be progressed into all kinds of [fancy exercises](https://media3.giphy.com/media/12lXUg3Zm8jhjW/200w.gif). Place your palms (or fingertips) on your shoulderblades and tense your butt. Now lean back without arching your lower back and move the arms. You can bend the knees a little. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=357))\n\n* **[Rear Hand Clasp](https://i.imgur.com/2Tb7ric.png)** | Did you ever want to scratch your back but couldn't reach the spot because you lacked behind-the-back flexibility? This is your exercise. It's good for your shoulderblades and to counter long sitting periods. This stretch is very important for upper body posture aswell! Get into a straight bodyline. Take a towel, a band or a t-shirt and grab both ends with your arms. One arm is overhead and one is behind the back. The upper arm pulls the lower arm gently into the stretch. Pull upwards. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=494))\n\n* **[Lying Cross](https://i.imgur.com/IghCB3M.png)** | The lying cross is a stretch that is aimed at people with poor posture. Start on all fours and move one arm below the other arm until your shoulder [touches the floor.](https://i.imgur.com/gSSlesx.png) To deepen the stretch, lay down on the floor and extend the non-stretched arm to the front. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=809))\n\n* **[Wrist-Biceps Stretch](https://i.imgur.com/oLzxXRA.png)** | This stretch works on your wrist flexibility and stretches your forearms, your biceps and your deltoid muscles. Stand next to a wall and place your palms on it. Fingers pointing backwards. Now straighten your arm and twist your upper body to the opposite direction. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=962))\n\n### Lower Body ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=1248))\n\n* **[One-Leg Pike](https://i.imgur.com/AkQKIrG.png)** | This stretches your hamstrings. Most people that sit on a computer all day have tight hamstrings, because those muscles are very tensed in a chair-sitting position. When you stretch them regularily, you can take load off your lower back. Flexible hamstrings progress into [the pike stretch](http://bravocrossfit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seated-pike-.jpg). Place your foot on a chair and lean forward with a straight back. If you're advanced enough to touch your toes with a straight back (!), then you can progress to the [standing version of the stretch.](https://i.imgur.com/SWZAKMa.png) ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=1248))\n\n* **[Kneeling Lunge](https://i.imgur.com/uzdn3Ad.png)** | The kneeling lunge works on your hamstrings, your quads and your hip muscles like the iliopsoas. This is the most important stretch to gain flexibility for the [front splits](https://cdn.gmb.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/splits-front.jpg). Place one foot in front of you and extend it slowly with a straight back. Use your hands to balance yourself properly. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=1521))\n\n* **[Pancake](https://i.imgur.com/uOIvAJG.png)** | The pancake stretches your hamstrings and your leg adductors. With strong leg adductors, you will have it much easier in martial arts and all dance moves. It also [looks really cool](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57e3a24d9f74564d81effe58/t/5a7d733324a6949ae9f16915/1518170938439/Pancake.jpg) in the full progression. Sit on the floor with a straight back and extend the legs to both sides. Lean forward.

Grab them with your hands and gently pull forward with a straight back. Try to bring your knees to the floor. If that's not yet possible, feel free to place a pillow under your knees. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=1930))\n\n* **[Calf Stretch](https://i.imgur.com/eWF32yZ.png)** | Many people neglect their calf muscles, although it is necessary to give your calves some love. Tight calves love to cramp and hurt. It can prevent heel spurs and all kind of degenerative feet diseases to regularily stretch and strengthen your feet muscles. Grab something and bend one knee forward. Extend the back leg and try to push the heel into the ground.

Feel free to insert your own specific stretch into the program!\n\n***\n\n###**How often should i do this program?**\n\nA good starting point would be two times a week. If you have the time, do it three times a week! If you lack time, split it up into upper and lower body and do both once a week.\n\n***\n\n###**Can i do this every day?**\n\nAbsolutely! However, if you feel pain or discomfort, do it a bit less. Your muscles need rest too and stretching is taxing your nervous system quite hard.\n\n***\n\n###**I have medical condition [insert here], can i do the program?**\n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all answer for this one. Ask on the subreddit and people will make sure to help you with your specific problem.\n\n***\n\n###**When should i do the program?**\n\nAny time when you are relatively stress free is perfect. When your mind is relaxed, stretching is easier. Don't do it before a workout, because it increases injury risk. After a workout is fine!\n\n***\n\n###**I don't like this stretch: [insert stretch], can i replace it with something else?**\n\nAbsolutely! You won't benefit from stretches that you don't do, because you hate them. Switch them up as much as you like and need.\n\n***\n\nHave anything to add or any questions?

Once again, I want to thank /r/Fitness  for all the support you've given me this past year, I truly appreciate it and hope I can repay it in kind.\n\n**Just-Show-me-the-Photos...**\n\n[Before/After Photos](https://imgur.com/a/jnLz1)\n\n\n**TL;DWTR (aka I've got a minute, give me the juicy details):**\n\nSo, it has been 1 year since I hit my 200lbs loss, ~9 months since I got below 200lbs for the first time in my adult life, and just over 6 months since I underwent skin removal surgery where the removed ~244 sq inches of skin. To make it short, it has been one crazy year. This post is both an update for all of the above, plus an update on my diet/exercise plan (as per the rules).\n\nThe surgery went well, but as you can see from the photos I'm kind of lopsided. My right side did not turn out as well as my left. As far as weight, I have maintained my 200lbs weight loss throughout the entire surgery, recovery and now as I work to regain what strength/muscle I lost.\n\nBelow is a VERY abbreviated backstory, the original is still [available here](https://ap.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5lioa6/m3862_4078_2072_200lbs_weight_loss/) and the second [update is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5wpxhb/update_goal_reached_m3862_4078_1996lbs_2082lbs/)\n\u200b\n\n*****************************************\n*****************************************\n\n**Quick Background:**\n\nI won't rehash the whole story again as the original posts from last year are still available, links below. \n\n\u200bWhen I was a kid I was told I would never be fat. By the time I graduated from High School I was ~320lbs. Starting my Junior year of college I moved to main campus, weighing about 390, and reached 400+ by end of the 1st year on campus. Second year on campus was when I reached my recorded max of 407.8lbs. It is likely that I weighed more, but the 407.8 figure is the highest I found logged by a medical office, so it is the one I use.\n\n\n*****************************************\n*****************************************\n\n**Diet:** \n\nFor the 2 years I have stuck to IIFYM, which is, in my humble opinion, the best out of the options I've personally tried. Approximately, 1800-1900 cals/day cutting. After the surgery I was told I had to eat, so I reverse dieted to 2000 to aid recovery. But this translated into \"eat all the foods\" since I didn't really have anything else to do. This did put some fat back on me since all I could do was sit and walk short distances. But I did maintain the 200lbs loss for a year now and have never crossed back into that.\n\nI shoot for 130g of food-based protein, minimum, regardless of diet or supplementation. Even on cheat days. But I usually get more like 180g a day.\n\nFat is usually under 45g/day, carbs make up the rest.\n\nTypical Meals:\n\n* **Breakfast:** 60g Oatmeal sweetened w/ Splenda, 4 piece of toast from Heiner's 35 calorie bread\n* **Pre-Workout:** Large Apple\n* **Lunch:** 8oz chicken breast, 250g sweet potato.\n* **Protein Bar** Rarely, but I prefer ones that don't go under a 10cal:1g protein ratio. (eg. 200cal bar w/ 20g protein)\n* **Dinner:** 6-8oz Lean meat, veggies, and I end the day's eating @ 6-7pm with a single serving protein pancake w/ SF syrup. Kodiak Dark Chocolate is hands down the best IMO.\n\nI don't personally believe in supplementation. Just a personal thing. But, I will drink some Myprotein-brand BCAAs after a particularly difficult workout, but nothing else. I do occasionally use protein powder, but it is usually to cook with, not drink, and when I do get some it is usually Myprotein or ON brand.\n\n*****************************************\n*****************************************\n\n**Exercise:** \n\nMy approach to fitness, given my age, is functional with a heavy slant on looking decent. I would like to have abs just one time in my life, just to look like the classic \"male.\" However, over the last few weeks I have realized that I just wasn't putting my all into it. I realize that, technically, I am still recovering from a massive surgery where the front of my body was split in twain. But, I never get sore anymore, I rarely mix up my exercises. I didn't add in new ones. I did a strict split and just tried to put up more weight. I told myself that *insert exercises I was good at* exercises is what I could do due to *insert BS excuse here* and never pushed forward.\n\nThen I met a good friend of mine, who is 18 years old. 21 years my junior, a local soccer star, cross country State finalist, and still hits the gym everyday. He pushes me harder than anyone I have ever met, refuses the \"nonsense\" of my age until I have actually tried something new. It reminds me of my niece who always says \"I don't like that\" when you offer something new to eat. For me it's \"Im too old/weak/recovering for that.\" He doesn't accept that until I have tried. If I could give any tip to someone new to this fitness/weight loss world it would be to find someone who doesn't take excuses. Not because you are paying them, but because they honestly know you well enough to see past the excuses, to see the person you could be.\n\nOver the last few weeks I have been fine tuning a new program, it is still in progress but this is pretty close to the final plan. The idea was to move away from a regular split to something that mimicked a 2 day/wk split while making it accessible for someone who doesn't have the recovery ability of a 20 year old. Plus, adding in more functional movements and core to each day versus a dedicated day. **Each day is a Heavy/Light split, the Heavy area being the main focus of the day and the Light being a secondary day, but no reduction in weight, just a reduced number of exercises.** \n\n**Split:**\n\nI don't have a set rep/set pattern for any exercise other than **10 reps for the first 2 sets of any exercise, then all additional sets are to failure.** Average range of sets is 4-8, depending on the exercise, weight, etc.\n\n* **Monday** is Heavy Chest / Light Back + Chinups, Pushups, 3x Core Exercises \n* **Tuesday** is Heavy Core / Light Legs + Pushups, Chinups, 2x Bicep Exercises\n* **Weds** is Heavy Back / Light Chest +  Pushups, Vacuums, 2x Core Exercises \n* **Thursday** is Deadlifts, Rackpulls, Pullovers, Pushups, 3x Core Exercises, Chinups\n* **Friday** is Heavy Shoulders / Light Arms + Pushups, Asst. Pullups, 3x Core exercises \n* **Sat** is Heavy Legs (focused) then Light Full Body (more or less I workout various things, all to failure, while I chat and enjoy the day) + Iso Bicep Exercises\n* **Sun** is Rest Day\n\n**Breakdown of Exercises:**\n\n* **Chest:** Chest Press (Machine), Landmine Press, Sven Press, Flat Bench, Incline Bench\n\n* **Back:** Machine Rows, Lat Pulldown, T-bar Row, Iso Low-Row, Cable Mid-Row, Lat Pressdown, Australian Pullups, DB Shrugs, I/T/Y/Ws, DB Rows, Lumbar Hyperextensions, Robbery Exercise w/ 20lb DBs\n* **Core:** Core Twist, Flutter Kicks, Reverse Crunches, Oblique Crunches, V holds, V Ball Passes, Ab-Pullovers, Hanging Leg Lift, L-Sit, Roman Chair Crunches\n* **Legs:** High Bar Squat, Goblet Squat, Air Squat, Barbell Calf Press, Leg Extensions, Glute Kickback Machine, Hamstring Curls, Glute Thrusts, Abd/Add Press, Leg Press\n* **Shoulders:** DB Scap Holds, Dislocations, DB OHP, BB OHP, Lateral Raises, Plate Raises, Plate Steering (use a plate like a steering wheel)\n* **Bicep/Tricep:** Standing DB Curl, Preacher Curls, Iso DB Curls, Cable Curls, Drag Curls, Hammer Curls, Tricep Pushdown, Tricep Cable Extension, Internal/External Rotator Cuff Cable Pulls\n\nAgain, these are all the same format. **10 reps for 2 sets, then everything else to failure with no hard set range.** Average is 4-8 sets, depends on exercise, weight, etc. Deadlifts are the odd man out, it is 5 reps each set, no set limits, just until I can't do it anymore or form breaks down. Usually it's 6-10 sets depending on weight progression.\n\nThe Mods asked me to elaborate on the weight progression of my fitness plan. Given my age I'm not really chasing the same dreams that the younger people are so my progression is more tailored to overall fitness. When I start a new exercise I find a weight that I can do 4-6 sets with, to failure each set, and that is where I start. However, this is not a hard and fast rule, some days as I start increasing the weight through the sets I get worn out and don't progress in weight that week. My goal is to push to failure each and every time. Overall I feel this gives a better workout for me and seems to still allow decent recovery.\n\nAs an example, I logged my previous deadlift day.\n\n* **Set 1:** 95lbs x 21 reps\n* **Set 2:** 115lbs x 17reps\n* **Set 3:** 135lbs x 13reps\n* **Set 4:** 185lbs x 10reps\n* **Set 5:** 205lbs x 6 reps\n* **Set 6:** 235lbs x 4 reps\n* **Set 7:** 235lbs x 3 reps\n\nI do log my workouts, but I don't track # of reps. I only track that I did a set to failure, how many sets I did total, and the maximum weight used. This is done by putting an X or a dot next to exercise which denotes a completed set. Then at the end I write down the maximum weight used across the exercise.\n\n**Cardio:** \n\nI have slowly added in either **sprint cardio** (Sprints on the Treadmill Usually) or some **long slow cardio** (Stair Climber is still my favorite). I do this **3-4 days a week and I do at least 2x 2-minute Sprints every day but Saturday.**\n\nI also do rehab-given exercises for shoulders, knees, and back to maintain the health of those areas. Those are just peppered in throughout the week. I won't list these here, **if you have an injury, see a doctor/physio.**\n\nYes, it is a lot each day. But I tend to thrive on a meticulously laid out plans. Plus, if I over-shoot in the plan, then Ill either overachieve daily or at least hit the mark in execution.\n\nI've only been lifting heavy again for about 2.5 months between the surgery and my shoulder. So these are my horribly weak, Post Recovery Lifts (these are for reps of 3 of more, not 1RM)\n\n* **Flat bench:** 155lbs\n* **Squat:** 155lbs\n* **Deadlift:** 235lbs\n\n**Extras:**\n\nI like to hike/backpack, swim for distance, and I run on the rare occasion, but aside from the gym I don't do much in the way of sports.\n\n*****************************************\n*****************************************\n\n\u200b**Whats Next:**\n\nYou can stamp a big \"VAIN\" on my forehead, but I want freaking abs. Just once. Also traps.\n\nMy gym mates and I just finished a 6 week \"Add-On\" plan I developed where we did vacuums and pushups every morning. I went from barely being able to do 15 pushups to easily being able to bust out 40-45 in one go. Everyone whined about the vacuums after the first 3 days, but now they are thanking me, it really is an undervalued exercise. Now that is done, I am planning to focus on my posture and my shoulders. I have some kyphosis in the upper back from years of being a computer geek then later a WoW nerd. So, I want to correct my posture as much as I can, which will translate into better, stronger shoulders.\n\nI am also going to have to try and figure out how to get the other 1 or 2 skin removals I will need to look \"normal\". My rear flanks/love-handle area will absolutely need fixed and my chest will likely need to be fixed. Until that point, I will continue to lose fat and get as functionally strong as I can get.\n\n*****************************************\n*****************************************\n\n**FAQ**\n\n* Are you going to lose any more weight?\n\n>My plastic surgeon has recommended I go down to 185, but no lower. At that point I should be focused on more of a recomp. As you can see from the pictures, there is still fat under the skin. I need to get rid of as much of that as I can.\n\n* Did you have surgery or use any drugs/medicine/chemicals?\n\n>\u200bNo. Nothing against them, I just feel the \"quick\" (but, clearly not painless) methods available lack a certain educational value to them. Sure, I can teach someone the techniques to keep off the 100lbs they lost from weight loss surgery, but actually living it for years, dealing with failures/obstacles, is nearly always the best teacher.\n\n* What's next?\n\n>I'd still like to climb a mountain. Maybe Mt. Rainier or Mt. Elbert?\u200b Something with proper snow and requires a bit of technical climbing.\u200b I'v\u200be \u200balways been a bit of an armchair mountaineer. A friend of mine climbed Kilimanjaro about a year after a dual cervical fusion, plus he is 12 years older than me, so what is and isn't possible for me kind of has been thrown out the window.\n\n* Did you ever consider suicide?\n\n>I put this on every update I do, or anything I post connected with weight loss. The answer is yes I have, on a few occasions, not my finest moments. **If you are considering suicide, PLEASE get help, there are lots of options for help, regardless of where you are in the world. You might think suicide will stop what you are currently feeling, but it also robs you of everything you could be. In the US you can call 1-800-273-8255, 911, or go to the nearest Emergency Room. Also, [here is a list of Suicide Prevention orgs in various countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines)**\n\n\u200bIf anyone has any other questions or comments feel free to ask.\u200b\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Finally hit 213lbs lost, then got under 200lbs, then 244 square inches of skin was removed, 4 months of recovery.

There was a gym in my town but it was quite expensive \u20ac65 per month for 1 free weight area and a stupid [milon circle?](http://www.miloncirkel.com/)..\n\n### Moving to England\n\nAlmost 2 years ago, I moved to the UK (Swindon) and they had a 24 hour gym. I thought, no more excuses and let's go. Browsing reddit and other forums I decided to start with Stronglifts 5x5. \n\n### Stronglifts 5x5\n\nThis was a great workout to start with, I did it for 3 months straight, never missing a single workout and gained a lot, the beginning is always fast. In those 3 months I went from 62kg (137lbs) to 70kg (155lbs). I got my bench up to 60kg, deadlift 120kg, row 70kg and OHP 45kg. I was **over the moon**, I felt stronger, shirts started to fit tighter and people started to notice slightly\n\n*Diet*: My diet at that time consisted of.. eating a ton of food and whole milk (GOMAD). I didn't count calories (still don't) but I always checked what pasta had the most calories, what meat etc. That and the additional 2000kcal I got from drinking 2.5L whole milk a day had me gaining a lot of weight. I stopped doing GOMAD after my skin started to get bad (a lot of pimples) and I had to go to the toilet about every hour. \n\n### PHUL \n\nAfter feeling *fairly* strong and done with Stronglifts, I started [PHUL](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout). 4 days a week. I did this for about 3 months and again, saw some nice gains. Switching up routines has worked really well for me. After ~3 months I just don't get sore anymore, so I change workouts and then I do. I did this workout up until like 76kg (167lbs).\n\n*Diet:* During these 3 months, I again, ate as much as possible. I was completely done with the milk but started taking weight gainer shakes. I bought the [Optimum Nutrition](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/opt/sm.html) one and took one before bed, every night.\n\n### PHAT\n\nAfter not getting sore anymore from PHUL, I started [PHAT](http://www.simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html). 5 days a week, training hard. I did this for about 4 months and saw decent results. I got up to 80kg (176lbs), my goal weight. You know what happens once you reach your goal? You feel great, but you want more (or at least I do). So the current goal then was (and still is now) 90kg (200lbs).\n\n*Diet:* Nothing special, still kept up the weight gainer shakes every night and just ate **a lot**. \n\n### Moving back to the Netherlands\n\nMy year in England was done, I wanted to move back. It was as if the god Brodin himself wanted me to keep getting gains because in my tiny town, there suddenly was a brand new, shiny **24h** gym. This couldn't be a coincidence.\n\n### 6 day PPL split\n\nI started with 3 days a week, went up to 4 days a week, moved to 5 days a week so now the most logical next step to me was to go 6 days a week. So I did with this [6 day PPL split](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/6-day-powerbuilding-split-meal-plan). I had been lifting for almost a year now and people told me I looked like I lift.. **Achievement Unlocked** -> Not looking DYEL anymore, finally. So I did this 6 days a week, again never skipping a workout and religiously going, looking forward to every day. \n\n**Diet:** Same old, just eat a lot. I moved back with my parents so I don't decide what's for dinner anymore... I got tired of the weight gainer shakes so I found something even better. \"quark\" with wallnuts.  I can't find the direct English word for it but it looks like [this](https://www.boodschappenboer.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Almhof-Volle-Kwark-Spaanse-Sinaasappel-500g1.jpg), it's like really thick yoghurt. One 500ml cup with wallnuts contains about 1050kcal and again, I took one before bed, every night. \n\n### Lazar Angelov's workout + Running\n\nI started this workout a month ago, when I was 83kg (182lbs) and I am at the time of writing, 85.5kg (189lbs). [This workout](http://www.gymaholic.co/articles/fitness/19/lazar-angelov-workout-and-diet) is a lot of fun and has muscle group days rather than pull / push days. Which is nice after ~10 months doing PPL. Before starting this workout I took a week off lifting because I had been lifting non stop. I hated not lifting and not going to the gym. Every hour I was thinking about the weights, looking at /r/bodybuilding, images of Steve Cook and Calum von Moger.. After that week I started the workout and man, I got super sore (again)! \n\n**Running**: So my new job was on the 4th floor, I take the elevator every day because Dom told me cardio kills gainz. I took the stairs \"for fun\" once and noticed my endurance sucked big time. Since Lazar's workout is 5 days a week, I got 2 rest days. That's 1 too much so I started running. Just 5-8km every Sunday. \n\n**Diet:** Same as with the PPL split, living the quark and wallnuts still. \n\n___ \n\n### Supplements\n\nI took protein shakes, BCAAs, ZMA, whatever. None of them longer than 2 weeks because I just didn't dig the shakes. The only supplements I have taken daily and will continue to do so are:\n\n* Creatine (3g)\n* Multivitamin\n* Fish Oil\n\nI feel like that's all I need, 5 pills when I wake up (multi + fish oil) and 1 scoop of creatine before I go to bed.\n\n### Sleep\n\n8 hours a night, every night. I know and feel sleep is important. My new job requires me to get up at 05:45. This is why I am in bed 21:45 Sunday to Thursday. I religiously sleep 8 hours at least and about 8.5-9 in the weekend. \n\n### No alcohol\n\nThis is an overstatement, I sure drank some pints in England with my colleagues but only 1 night a week. If I drank Friday, I didn't drink on Saturday and vice-versa. I barely drink **any** alcohol nowadays as it just doesn't taste as good anymore. I used to love drinking beer with my friends but now I just drink water, only water.\n\n___ \n\n### Conclusion\n\nStarting to lift has been the best decision in my life. I was always that skinny kid with red hair. I was scared of confrontation and I just felt weak. Now 1.5 years later people tell me I'm \"getting big\" and \"starting to look like a closet\" (that probably sounds cooler in Dutch). Someone in that /r/brogress thread told me I inspired him (or her). That was really cool to hear. I hope to inspire more people and that's why I wrote this long ass post. \n\nEDIT:\nI don't know why my post got locked but I didn't do it. Thanks for the nice PMs everyone and yes I like this manbun for now, I'm not going to cut it off because a few internet strangers tell me to haha!\n\nEDIT2: \nSome of you have asked my Instagram / Snapchat, it's the same as my reddit username but I don't post a lot. Just the occasional gym selfie..\n\nEDIT3: \nSo it went kinda viral, [The LAD Bible posted it on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LADbible/posts/2680121988701641?comment_id=948105178606573&notif_t=like).

I tried googling it, but came up with nothing. My curiosity is too immense to just let it go.\n\nPicture this. I'm in the gym doing my thing. I grabbed a bench and was doing dumbbell rows by myself. Nothing out of the ordinary, until I see these pair of guys working out right next to me. One of them was big. Strong big. As in if he slapped my girlfriends ass, I would tell her to apologize to avoid a confrontation big. Now the other guy was more or less the opposite. He looked like one of those guys that ventures out from the confines of his own home maybe once every six months. \n\nThe big guy, he's doing dumbbell curls, and putting up a respectable numbers, but I couldn't help but be distracted by the smaller one. He's standing so close to him he could kiss him, and has his index finger extended and won't stop poking the big guy's arm. Like locked in, laser precision, just tap tap tapping the guy's bicep. And the big guy obviously wants this to happen. He's curling the weight, and I'm talking about teeth clenched, veins popping out of his skull, grunt yelling effort being put into this exercise, while this guy who looks more robot than human won't give the tapping a rest. \n\nThere also seems to be this sort of quiet self-consciousness about the whole procedure, because every once and a while the big guy would look around like he was being watched. To be fair he was. I couldn't take my eyes off of it. We made eye contact several times, and I hated myself for it.\n\nThey switch places, and now it's the little guys turn. He adjusts the weight, and starts curling. And the big one is standing next to him, scrolling through his phone, rocking his body just slightly to the music in his headphones. Of course, now I'm thinking \"why isn't he getting his bicep tapped?\" And now I'm in this existential loop where I'm asking myself why I'm so concerned with who's getting their arm tapped, and maybe that I'm the strange one for expecting the taps to be returned. \n\nAnd then it happens. The big one, he sees the little guy struggling and he hops right in. Only he's not just using one finger. He's using five, then ten. He's mixing up rhythms and tempos, and circling around his struggling friend in an elegant display of whatever the fuck I'm watching. I mean, he's tapping this kid's bicep like this talent was a gift from God, and he was born to exercise it. The thing is, this smaller guy, his form improves, his arm, although quaking before, is now steady and he grits his teeth and finishes the set. I couldn't believe my eyes.\n\nI guess what I'm wondering is what the hell was going on? Did I stumble upon some secret fitness tip past down from generations of bicep tappers? Is this a normal thing that I was blissfully unaware of? Obviously, I'm making a bigger deal out of this then what needs to be made, but if I don't discover some kind of answer to what was happening, I fear that I will never be satisfied in this life or the next.\n\nEdit: Just got home, and apparently I just got reddit gold. If there's one thing I hate it's people that get all mooshy and emotional once they're gilded, so I'm not going to do any of that. Instead I would like to take the time to talk about an issue very near and dear to my heart: Milk. It's a beverage that simply should not be a menu option in any country that is not ravaged by corruption or poverty, and personally, as an American I'm ashamed to see it available here in the states. Call me a bigot. I don't care. I'll say it: I'm lactose intolerant. I'm just playing. Thanks for the love people! If I could, I would tap each and every single one of your biceps, provided that the exchange was consensual.

It sucked. I had been fat my entire life and always wanted to change it. I wanted to change because for one its unhealthy to be that size. I had zero confidence. I wanted to be in the military and one day be a police officer or firefighter/paramedic but I wasn't going to get there being fat. There are plenty of reasons I can rattle off for my obesity but it all comes down to laziness and ignorance to nutrition.\n\nSo 2.5 years ago my uncle got me into lifting (forcefully lol). We'd lift almost everyday after I got up around 3pm (I worked 3rd shift). We'd lift for a few hours and before I knew it I had to get ready for work soon. So I had only a small window of time to eat and chill out versus waking up and eating/chilling all day then going to work. A month went by and I finally weighed myself. I lost 6 pounds and figured to myself that I might as well keep this up... and that's what happened. I found out about calorie counting which made my progress even better and taught me how to eat (I honestly had zero clue about the whole energy in vs energy out stuff). Then I found reddit and r/fitness and took in lots of info from here and just applied all the basics from the FAQ + other things, 2.5 years go by and boom! I'm fit enough to go to recruit training so I do, and I accomplish a huge goal! \n\nThats all I can think to write right now so feel free to ask questions!\n\nedit: I'm 5'11 btw, forgot to put it in the title.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Transformation(M/22/SW:366lbs CW:190lbs) From morbid obesity to US Marine.", "post_ups": 10999, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3chqy8/transformationm22sw366lbs_cw190lbs_from_morbid/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:08.475838", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Tovero", "post_created_utc": 1511651294.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1511652172.0, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "7fircq", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 477, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 10659, "post_selftext": "Yesterday I hit a 455lb / 207kg deadlift, which brought my total up to 1,002lb.

I started powerlifting training specifically in the fall of 2013, my 1st powerlifting meet was summer 2014 after reddit told me I was actually pretty good and should compete, lol. I was 110lb / 50kg when I started lifting.\n\nI was self coached up until this past summer when I started working with RTS and Mike. \n\nI did starting strength my 1st year of powerlifting but stalled out around the time I did my 1st meet. My numbers were S:245 B:135 D:335 @120lb bodyweight. After that, I switched to a PPL x2 that I wrote. I did that for another year and a half till my lifts were around S: 275 B:150 D:405. I then started an upper/lower split where I did bench 2x a week and squat + deadlifts 2x a week but I alternated which I focused on as the main lift. I was on that until I started coaching with RTS. My lifts were S:315 B:175 D:425 and bodyweight was 128 out of comp.\n\n\n**Current Training**\n\n\nI decided to go up a weight class at that time, from 125 (57kg) to 138 (63kg). I am 5'5 so I was doing myself a huge disservice competing in the 57kg class where everyone else was a half foot smaller than me. Since going up 4 months ago, my lifts have increased dramatically and so has my wilks! RTS had me on an upper/lower split similar to my old one till I competed at USAPL Raw Nationals last month. \n\nSince Nationals, I have been on a full body routine 4x a week, with a bench variation each workout as well as a squat or deadlift variation and accessories. The volume each workout is low to make up for the high frequency. It took my joints and muscles about 3 weeks to get used to the frequency. I seem to be handling it ok now.\n\nThe deadlift PR was a total YOLO move on my part and not programmed at all :). I wanted to play with the deadlift bar. This was my 2nd time ever using one, with the 1st being back in 2014.\n\n[Progress photos](https://imgur.com/a/2Q4FG).\n\n\n**Diet**\n\nPretty relaxed. I suck at eating so my #1 goal is just getting my calories. I maintain around 2200-2500. My #2 goal is getting enough protein. I aim for 100g bare minimum and 160g+ when I am prepping for a comp. For supplements, I use protein powder and sometimes take creatine. I take a multivitamin, fish oil, vitamin D, zinc, magnesium, and melatonin every night before bed. \n\n\n ", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Made it to the 1,000lb club!!

To begin, this picture is from when I had already lost 50 pounds (so around 210-220).\n\nThe first 50 pounds was lost 100% through using a keto diet paired with strict calorie counting. I kept my daily calorie intake around 1400-1600 per day and it took approximately 4 months to shed the first 50 pounds. Again, no exercise was used, barely even walks around the neighborhood.\n\nThe next 50-60 pounds, I decided I'd like to speed things up a bit so I implemented running around my neighborhood paired with some light dumbbell training. Mainly just 15 pound dumbbells and different variations of chest presses, curls, tricep extensions, etc. This got me all the way down to 160 pounds. Now was the time to actually build up muscle and by this point I was 3 years into the process.\n\nSo for the last 5 years I've kept the same workouts and have progress. I have been running PHAT (Power Hypertrophy Adaptive Training). It's a 5 day a week workout program that I stuck to religiously and over the past 5 years I can count on both my hands the amount of workouts I actually missed.\n\nInstead of typing out the workout, I used this spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z88d0BCV7jDOyPouLc5TzYjAqY9u_p8ZnTmDkaABACE/edit#gid=0\n\nI have gone through 5 years of bulking and cutting cycles and have finally reached the body I want.\n\nIf anyone has any questions about any of my struggles along the way, please reach out and I'll try my hardest to help!\n\nAs for diet, it was strictly an IIFYM approach. I did this 100% through calorie counting!!! No BS fad diets or anything. I ate what I wanted, when I wanted, but as long as I was under my caloric goals for the day (around 1600-1800 for cutting, 2800-3000 for bulking) I always saw results.\n\nAn additional picture featuring saggy stomach: https://imgur.com/a/ISsqbDH\n\nand another progress picture from when I initially dropped from 275 to 160 before starting to build muscle - https://imgur.com/a/JKpfeCE", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "8 long years of trial & error, sweat, grueling workouts, a near perfect diet, and a goal that finally got achieved", "post_ups": 10254, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8skhqu/8_long_years_of_trial_error_sweat_grueling/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:08.475838", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "FroztbyteSC2", "post_created_utc": 1528116527.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1528135356.0, "post_gilded": 3, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 3, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "8ogzss", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 660, "post_num_crossposts": 2, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 9778, "post_selftext": "26/M/5\u201910 - How Fitness Transformed me from an Obese, Narrow-Minded Gamer into a Wildly Different Person\n\n**PHOTOS:**\n\n[Before and After Photos](https://imgur.com/a/zhqy9Ux) (TLDR): \n\n**Weight:** \n\n215lbs \u2014> 155 lbs\n\n(That\u2019s 97.5kg down to 70.3kg)\n\n\n\n**Time Period:** \n\nTechnically 3 years of weight loss (explained in post) but the most dramatic changes happened in the past year. I started lifting in May of 2017.\n\n\n\n**Lift Progress Summary:**\n\nDL:       95lbs -\u2013> 295x3 (275x5)\n\nSquat:  75lbs \u2014> 265x5\n\nBench: 105lbs \u2013> 185x3 (175x5)\n\nOHP:    65lbs \u2014> 115x5\n\n\n\nNever did 1-rep Maxes. These are just the highest lifts I\u2019ve recorded in the gym. \n\n\n\nMost of these are from a few months ago when I weighed a few more pounds and my lifting routine was more \u2018consistent.\u2019 My lifts are a bit lower now.\n\n\n\n**Program:** \n\nFor the most part, I based it on u/metallicadpa \u2019s PPL Program. It\u2019s available in the \u2018recommended routines\u2019 in this subreddit\u2019s wiki.\n\nEDIT: A lot of folks in the comments asked for a link to the PPL program. Here it is:\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/\n\n\n*Disclaimer: I didn\u2019t truly follow this program as prescribed. And to be honest, if I had stuck to this program more strictly, I\u2019m sure I would\u2019ve seen a lot better results. It\u2019s very effective. But for a variety of life/personal reasons combined with some fuckarounditis, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to the creator to say that I \u2018actually\u2019 followed his program for a full year. Nonetheless, I\u2019m pretty happy with my progress so far and I owe a lot to this program for giving me my foundation.*\n\n\n\n**Diet**\n\nAs for Diet, I just tracked my calories with MyFitnessPal. \n\n\n\nThe specifics of what I ate are not too important - but the act of counting calories consistently is the single most important thing I did in this entire journey. \n\n\n\nYes daily calorie-tracking is tedious. Yes it sucks. But that\u2019s exactly why so many people fail at weight loss. If you want the results bad enough, you\u2019ll do it.\n\n\n\n*Anyway - A typical day of eating might look like this:* \n\n-I skip breakfast most days. I guess this means I \u201cintermittent fast.\u201d It works for me because I\u2019m not hungry in the morning and I\u2019m always very hungry after work / in the evening.\n\n\n\nLunch (~420 calories)\n\n* Turkey sandwich on thin wheat\n*\n* Sliced orange/yellow bell peppers\n \n* Dannon Light/Fit Greek Yogurt\n\n\n\nI like to meal prep this on Sundays so it\u2019s basically on auto-pilot.\n\n\n\nDinner: (1000-1100 calories)\n\n* Chicken Breast - 8-12oz\n\n* Small/healthy microwaveable meals, usually with Chicken (think weight watchers, healthy choice, etc)\n \n* Steamed Vegetables\n \n* A few cups of Greek Yogurt \n\n\n\nAlso coffee and water. Copious amounts of black coffee and water.\n\n\n\n**PREFACE:**\n\nFirst, this is probably not the most dramatic transformation you\u2019ll ever read. But this roughly marks 1 year of \u2018getting my shit\u2019 together so it seems like a fitting time for a progress post. So much has changed for me in the last year, between work, life, fitness, and more - and most of it started with discovering the r/fitness community a year ago. So it felt like the right time to post something.\n\n\n\nSecond, while this post is not about video games - some sections will talk about them in-detail. I\u2019ll try to mark the sections as skippable for the non-gaming audience here. But I think there are a lot of folks, specifically gamers, who might be in a similar situation to the \u2018old\u2019 me. So I\u2019m leaving those details in this story for folks who might be in a similar phase of their fitness journey to where I used to be.\n\n\n\nLastly, I\u2019ll note that I don\u2019t believe video games are inherently \u2018bad\u2019 (I still enjoy them a lot from time to time). It\u2019s just that in my case, my old approach to games reinforced a very problematic and sedentary lifestyle. A lifestyle that I\u2019m now happy to be rid of.\n\n\n\nAlright, let\u2019s begin - \n\n\n\n**Background / How I got fat**\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve actually been out of shape for most of my life.  I almost never exercised or thought at all about the consequences of what I was eating. I typically ate whatever was either convenient or tasted good without ever thinking about what I was putting into my body. \n\n\n\nGrowing up, I never had any athletic sports that I was passionate about, but I definitely did have a \u2018competitive drive.\u2019 My main hobby growing up was playing video games - a hobby that i\u2019ve loved since as long as I could remember holding a SNES controller in my hands. As I got older, this \u2018drive\u2019 manifested itself in my gaming experience. Starting with Halo, then Starcraft 2 (hey look at my reddit name), then eventually League of Legends and more - the drive kept me hooked on games. I was determined to get better. \n\n\n\nThe positive side - is that I developed some helpful habits that helped me to get decently good at games. I had the discipline to constantly self-criticize my own play, refine my technique, and learn from gaming professionals in order to get better than my peers and improve.\n\n\n\nBut this \u2018drive\u2019 mindset was a double-edged sword. While the \u2018focus\u2019 was certainly valuable, I realize now that I was actually extremely narrow-minded. I ignored many other critical aspects of my life in favor of competitive improvement. It took me a long time to realize this. Snapping out of it - really all began here with r/fitness.\n\n\n\n**College - The Weight-Gain Train**\n\n\n\nWhen I went to college, everything got worse...waaaaaaay worse. My newfound \u2018freedom\u2019 led to increased consumption of junk food, much more heavy drinking. I basically realized I could eat Pizza and Chipotle whenever I wanted. So I did just that.\n\n\n\nI was also a chronic procrastinator and had a very unhealthy approach to academics. It would not be uncommon to find me in a computer lab procrastinating until 2:30am, ordering a pizza, and then finally doing my assignment. Despite spending hours constantly procrastinating or gaming, I always told myself \u201cI didn\u2019t have the time to workout\u201d because I was constantly behind on schoolwork. \n\n\n\nThis led to a significant weight gain (I know, shocker!). But I got better at games - which was all I really cared about.\n\n\n\n**Post-Graduation**\n\n\n\nWhen I graduated I weighed about 215lbs. I gained more than 40 pounds while in my 4 years at school.\n\n\n\nNow that I had graduated and had a full-time job, I \u2018said\u2019 enough is enough and tried to refine some of my bad habits. I cut out major diet offenders. No more late night pizza orders. No more soda or energy drinks. Yes I\u2019d still frequently eat junk food for dinner and didn\u2019t track my calories, but I forced myself to at least eat a healthier lunch.\n\n\n\nAnd I began running. God this sucked at first. I remember I couldn\u2019t run a single damn mile. Not even close. I was wheezing and drooping in sweat in less than a half-mile. But I just kept going to a local park after work and made running part of my routine.  Gradually the distance increased substantially.\n\n\n\nAll these new habits took me a long way. I lost quite a bit of weight (at least 20lbs). I was feeling good about it. Eventually even tried on my old suit and my crazy long sleeves made me feel like one of those inflatable \u2018arm flailing\u2019 tube men that you see in front of grand openings. Success (or so I thought).\n\n\n\nBut eventually the progress stopped. The weight loss halted. It happened because it got harder and I wasn\u2019t actually pushing myself. I wasn\u2019t really trying.\n\n\n\nAnd I also still poured almost every free moment I had into video games...\n\n\n\n**From Gaming to Fitness**\n\n\n\nThis section probably won\u2019t make any sense to anyone who doesn\u2019t play competitive video games so you can SKIP this section and jump to \u2018EPIPHANY\u2019 if that\u2019s not your cup-of-tea.\n\n\n\nBut failing to get promoted into Diamond league in League of Legends might\u2019ve been one the best things that ever happened to me. Let me attempt to explain.\n\n\n\nI was not just a casual gamer. I always strived to be competitive. I always wanted to be the best (or at least constantly getting better). I was addicted to seeing myself improve. In order to make that happen, I developed a sense of discipline and practice that helped me to climb decently fast. I won\u2019t pretend I was a League \u2018God\u2019 or anything. There are many better players than me. But I eventually climbed to top 2% in North America. I also co-launched and hosted a weekly podcast related to teaching people how to improve at the game (shoutout to anyone from Tforce/4wards who might be reading this) and I gave individual coaching/lessons. And that was all while working a full-time job with a 1.5hour commute, often playing half as many ranked games as many of my similarly-ranked peers.\n\n\n\nNow I attribute my rapid climb to my discipline & focus combined with my \u2018drive.\u2019 No matter how high I climbed, I was a constant student of the game. I learned from watching Korean pro players who were way better than me. I\u2019d spend hours breaking down what they did to be successful and trying to apply it to my own play. I constantly \u2018drilled\u2019 myself in somewhat repetitive tasks and game mechanics until it was almost sub-conscious to me. I regularly reviewed my play, or when I\u2019d make mistakes and was very critical of myself because I wanted to get better. \n\n\n\nAnd I climbed because\u2026I wanted it. I wanted it bad. I worked really hard at it. I was driven. But as anyone who has played the game knows - many folks don\u2019t truly care about their rank until the season is about to end. Until there\u2019s a deadline that they have to address. That was me (remember I mentioned I was a procrastinator?). \n\n\n\nAt the very end of season 6 of league of legends, I decided to \u201cpush myself\u201d to get into Diamond - but I had waited way too long to start. As the deadline approached, I dropped nearly everything else in my life to focus on climbing. I basically sat at my computer all day grinding games, practicing technique, or reviewing replays. Eat, sleep, game, repeat. I put in a ton of work and saw a tremendous amount of progress in a short period of time\u2026\n\n\n\nBut...it didn\u2019t happen. I ran out of time. The weekend before the season ended, I was a single victory away from winning a promotion series that would have granted me my coveted \u201cdiamond border\u201d multiple times. But I didn\u2019t make it. I was crushed.\n\n\n\nWhy do I mention this all this gaming nonsense? I swear it connects back to fitness. Here we go.\n\n\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t make it to Diamond, my first instinct was to get the climb out of the way early in Season 7. I was already practically there - so I thought \u201cthis will be a piece of cake.\u201d With this mindset I became lazy. I cut a lot of corners that helped me to climb in the first place and eventually started falling in rank. I realized that if I wanted to see the type of progress I needed to climb quickly again - I was going to have to invest every ounce of my free time and energy into this game again\u2026 \n\n\n\n\u2026And then that thought filled me with dread.\n\n\n\n**EPIPHANY**\n\nWait. why? Why should I work so hard for this? \n\n\n\nNow knowing how grueling my experience would be to get back to another Diamond promotion series with my old approach to the game - I asked myself - how could I possibly justify it? I would have to give up every free moment of my life to get a shiny border on a loading screen for internet bragging rights. \n\n\n\nI decided that I\u2019d be better off putting my time and efforts into something else. I hypothesized that if I put half as much effort into any other aspect of my life as I did trying to climb in video games - that I could see tremendous results. So I decided to test that theory\u2026with fitness. \n\n\n\nI then quit playing ranked league altogether, took a \u201cbefore\u201d photo - and then read the r/fitness wiki.\n\n\n\n**Foray into fitness - 1 Year Ago**\n\nMany initial struggles. I was terrified of attempting compound lifting movements at they gym. But I also knew they were important. I watched a bunch of YouTube videos on proper form and read a bunch of articles on diet. Most importantly - I read through the r/fitness wiki. Multiple times.\n\n\n\nI settled on doing u/metallicadpa\u2019s PPL routine. And I started counting my calories strictly.\n\n\n\n* A month later - wow. \n\n* 2 months and some beginner gains later - **Holy shit.** This actually works. \n\n\n\nI realized that if you truly work at something with persistence and  discipline day-in and day-out - then the seemingly impossible suddenly becomes possible. And I was never the same again.\n\n\n\n**Transforming my Life**\n\n\n\nWith all this extra time I had saved from not grinding video games - it quickly became apparent that I should pick up some new hobbies and practices. \n\n\n\nI picked up rock climbing to stay active. I got back into playing guitar -which I hadn\u2019t played in years. I pushed myself to be more social and outgoing after years of sitting inside a room playing games until 2am  nearly every evening. Soon my whole life felt very different. \n\n\n\nOver the course of the next year:\n\nWORK - I got promoted, and also joined an awesome new team recently. They\u2019re the best.\n\n\n\nSOCIAL - I made new friends, re-kindled old friendships, and \u2018hung out\u2019 with people way more than when I was grinding games. I shifted from my narrow-minded self that was only concerned with video games, who struggled to relate to people \u2014> to being genuinely interested in other people and their passions. It\u2019s been a massive life-changer.\n\n\n\nLIVING - I gradually transitioned from a recent college grad with student-loan debt living with his parents to an adult who is living debt-free in one of the most incredible cities in the world. \n\n\n\nPRODUCTIVITY, PROCRASTINATION, & STRESS - I realized that a lot of the stress I had and procrastination could be avoided by applying proper discipline and planning. By writing things down and properly managing my time with discipline day-in and day-out, I often work half as hard as I used to and achieve 5-10x times the results in terms of productivity. I often think back on how much stress I had during school with procrastination, and I now think I could easily get way better grades with half the amount of \u2018effort.\u2019  \n\n\n\nTRAVEL - Last year I went on a two-week Euro-trip with my friends and it was one of the best experiences of my life. This [photo from Norway](https://imgur.com/a/mZD8ryD) has one of my best genuine smiles. I love doing active & outdoor activities now. I am planning to travel more in the coming months.\n\n\n\n**A brief note regarding fitness, girls, and confidence:**\n\nA lot of people get into fitness to attract the opposite sex (or same sex). It was certainly a \u2018motivating factor\u2019 for me initially.\n\n\n\nAnd yes - the gains have helped :)\n\n\n\nBut really, the added confidence I gained from smiling at myself in the mirror in the morning, combined with developing a more broad range of hobbies & interests - did way more for my dating life than just fitness alone. If I just replaced my obsession with gaming with an obsession with fitness - I doubt I would be as happy as I am now.\n\n\n\n**Looking forward**\n\nI\u2019ve never really \u201cbulked\u201d before. I\u2019m eager to see where I could be after a full bulk-cut cycle. But right now, fitness has taken a bit of a back-seat compared to some other priorities in my life. That said, I\u2019m looking to start my first true \u2018bulk\u2019 sometime in the late fall, most likely November. \n\n\n\nFor now, I\u2019ll continue my weekly ritual of eating at a deficit during the week so that I can enjoy the weekends without as much guilt and still say \u2018somewhat\u2019 lean. I\u2019m probably not going to have a 6 pack at this rate (not willing to give up alcohol and other delicious weekend foods right now). Admittedly, that was a pretty hard pill to swallow initially but I\u2019ve come to terms with it. That said, I lead a pretty active lifestyle and I don\u2019t anticipate I\u2019ll get too out of shape either. And then I\u2019ll reign it all in and get \u2018strict\u2019 again once I start my bulk so it doesn\u2019t get too out of control.\n\n\n\n**Tips / advice that helped me**\n\n-**Read the wiki.** I know that this is beaten to death here, but seriously do it. It\u2019s probably the most important thing related to fitness that I\u2019ve ever read.\n\n-Consistency is everything. Fuck \u201cmotivation.\u201d This is about consistently about getting your ass in the gym and watching your diet. Even on days when you really don\u2019t want to.\n\n-Once you lose some weight - remember to buy new clothes that fit you. Seriously makes a big difference.\n\n-Meal prep on Sundays. Eat copious amounts of Chicken & Greek Yogurt. Drink plenty of Black Coffee.\n\n\n\n**Special Thanks**\n\n-This community. Especially progress posters. You gave me the reinforcement I needed. Thank you.\n\n-Thanks to u/metallicadpa for writing the PPL program.\n\n-And special thanks to the mods who keep this place up and running\n\n\n\n**Lastly I\u2019ll just say this:**\n\nIf you decide you want it bad enough, that\u2019s literally all it takes. Fitness is not complicated.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no magical barrier from preventing you from succeeding. Ignore any dumb voice or excuse in your head. It\u2019s all bullshit. \n\n\n\nSeriously, your results are yours, and they are there for the taking. Just start.\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "26/M/5\u201910 - How Fitness Transformed me from an Obese, Narrow-Minded Gamer into a Wildly Different Person", "post_ups": 9778, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8ogzss/26m510_how_fitness_transformed_me_from_an_obese/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:08.475838", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "RonBurgundyIsBest", "post_created_utc": 1422529874.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2u2k6q", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 1203, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 9573, "post_selftext": "I just stumbled over this newspaper article and thought this might be interesting to see here.

How does it work?**\n\n* A foam roller is a large, cylindrical self massage tool. You roll over this cylinder and the pressure of your own bodyweight helps to knead your muscles and relax large areas of your body. So, that's why I have one. It's like getting free massages for the rest of your life.\n\n* # [Link to video tutorial on how to use the foam roller.](http://youtu.be/miFbBqZ_Zj8?list=PLOj76wV2WfPuiHYrXTYsRQ67xfOJTcNd0)\n\n## **Foam Rolling GIFs**\n\nI also made looping GIF's with my doggie to help save you time.\n\n* [Upper Back](http://gfycat.com/CooperativeImpracticalGrassspider) (avoid lower back; edit: [read here why](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5pwxki/foam_rollers_and_lacrosse_balls_are_awesome/dcukorl/))\n* [Neck](http://gfycat.com/NastySomeCanadagoose) (not meant to be aggressive)\n* [Calves](http://gfycat.com/RemorsefulHandsomeHarrier)\n* [Shins](http://gfycat.com/OccasionalLameChafer) (lateral side to get anterior tibialis)\n* [Quads / Hip Flexors](http://gfycat.com/CircularLastHatchetfish) (bent legs and/or straight legs)\n* [IT Band / VLO / Hip](http://gfycat.com/AcidicCanineHornshark) \n\n**Note:** I like to do 10 passes for each body part. However, you don't *have to* constantly roll back and forth. Sometimes, just putting pressure on ONE tender spot and holding it for 30-60sec is effective, too.\n\n---\n\n## **What is a lacrosse ball? How does it work?**\n\n* When someone gives you a deep tissue massage, they use their palms/fingers/elbows to apply pressure to help relax tight muscles and make you feel better. A lacrosse ball is a fairly hard, dense ball about the size of a tennis ball that helps mimic this deep release massage with your own bodyweight. It allows for much more localized pressure than a foam roller.\n\n* # [Link to video tutorial on how to use a lacrosse ball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUjoQuJ36OU&index=5&list=PLOj76wV2WfPuiHYrXTYsRQ67xfOJTcNd0)\n\n* The best part is that you could go to town on your **glutes and hamstrings** in a way that not even many massage-therapists will because of how intimate that area is. (When was the last time someone FIRMLY massaged your ASS? Right?)  So thats why I have one, to get free ass massages, haha. (No but seriously, it's great for the whole body.)\n\n# **Lacrosse Ball GIFs**\n\nAgain, I made GIF's with my doggie to help save time.\n\n1.

This works extremely well for the glutes and triceps and many other areas.\n\n**Lacrosse Ball Alternatives**\n\n* If you don't have a lacrosse ball, you could use a tennis ball, baseball, softball, billiard ball, cricket ball, floor hockey ball, golf ball, spalding bouncey ball as alternatives. They don't work as well as the lacrosse one in some cases, but it's better than nothing and sometimes it may even be better!\n\nWith the combination of a lacrosse ball and foam roller, I can practically massage most of my body and the best part is, **these don't take up much room and I could easily travel with them,** *especially* the lacrosse ball.

And I must say that that has been *the* best thing of all. It has now been a year since the change above and I look the same, I have maintained both my weight/muscle-mass by going to the gym 1-2 (I haven't calorie-counted since) \n\nFor those that want to know\n**here are my measurements:**\n\n\n| My measurments   | Value    \n|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|\n|     **Age**    |          25 years|      \n|     **Sex**    |          Female|    \n| **Height**  |    5 ft 7 in/170 cm|  \n| **Starting weight**       |        136lbs/62kg |        \n| **Ending weight**       |        121lbs/55kg | \n| **Net weight loss**       |        15lbs/7kgs|  \n\n| HOW I DID IT |\n|:--| \n\n\nI decided to start heavy lifting after one very kind person in /r/fitness (shoutout to you /u/sknick_) recommended a very wonderful fitness-author to me. After reading a bit about him, I bought his book dedicated to heavy lifting for amateur women. It detailed everything about weight-lifting/weight loss from the beginning, and I was so thrilled I decided to follow the program to the T!\n\n\n\n**The exact program I followed during the 3 months**\n\n\n| Day  | Excersizes    \n|:-----------|------------:|\n|     **Monday** -  Chest and Abs |          Bench Press (3 sets, 4-6 reps)\n |Incline Bench press (3 sets, 4-6 reps)\n |Dumbell Incline Bench Press (3 sets, 8-10 reps)\n |Dips (3 sets, 8-10 reps)\n |Cable Crunch (3 sets, 15-20 reps)\n |Leg Raises (3 sets to failure)\n |Air Bikes (3 sets to failure)\n |------------------------------------------------------|      \n|     **Tuseday**  - Back  |          Barbell Deadlifts (3 sets, 4-6 reps)\n |Barbell Bent over Row (3 sets, 8-10 reps)\n |Dumbell one arm row (3 sets, 8-10 reps)\n |Close grup Front lateral pulldown (3 sets, 8-10 reps)\n |------------------------------------------------------| \n|     **Wednesday**  - Shoulders  |          Military Press (3 sets, 8-10 reps)\n |Barbell up right Row (3 sets, 8-10 reps)\n |Lateral Raise (3 sets, 8-10 reps)\n |Dumbell Bent Over Delt Raise (3 sets, 8-10 reps)\n |------------------------------------------------------|\n|     **Thursday**  - Arms  |          Dumbbell alternative Bicep curl (3 sets, 8-10 reps)\n |Tricep pushdown (V-Bar) (3 sets, 8-10 reps)\n |Barbell Curl (3 sets, 8-10 reps)\n |Dumbell seated Tricep Press (3 sets, 8-10 reps)\n |------------------------------------------------------|  \n|     **Friday**  - Legs  |          Barbell Squat (3 sets, 4-6 reps)\n |Leg Press Machine (3 sets, 8-10 reps)\n |Romanian Deadlift (3 sets, 8-10 reps)\n |------------------------------------------------------| \n\nThese workouts take around 45/60 minutes each (so not so much!). \n\n**HIIT-training**: In addition to these gym session I did High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) in the form of running 3 times a week, each session being 20 minute. \n(HIIT-jogging: You jog for a minute, sprint for 30-60 seconds, jog another minute, jog for 30-60 seconds again etc. until you reach around 20 minutes. There are great free apps for this type of workout, for example \"HIIT interval training timer\")\n\n------------------------\n\n\n**Calorie Counting**\n\nAs I wanted to get leaner I cut during these 3 months (I was at a calorie deficiency). To calculate what my daily macors (fats/proteins/carbohydrates) and calories should be for good weight-loss, I used the following formula for my starting weight (also taken from the book).\n\n1. Eat 1.2 grams of protein per pound of body weight each day\n2. Eat 1 gram of carbs per body weight each day\n3. Eat 0.2 grams of fats per body weight each day\n\nFor me that became 163 grams of protein per day (1,2 grams *136 lbs), 136 grams of carbohydrates per day (1 gram *136 lbs) and 27 grams of fat per day (0,2 grams *136 lbs).\n\nYou then use these values to count your daily calorie intake. 1 carb is 4 calories, 1 protein is 4 calories and one fat is 9 calories. \nI calculated about 1300 calories per day, which I followed exactly during those months.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nAnd that's all I did! Simply put my body feels great now and just filled with power. When I run I feel springy on my feet, when I play with my friends and family I use my body with joy because it feels so strong. And that is something I want to convey. Not only is heavy lifting a great way to get lean/look good if that is your main concern, but the changes to the *feeling* of your body is amazing. One of the best decisions I have made in my life :) The 3 months was an intense workout-effort, but once you get there maintaining what you achieved takes very little effort! (I go to the gym 1-2 a week and that's it, I look more or less the same as when I just finished the intense training period now one year later. When I maintain I go once a week with the following excersizes (also taken from the author): Squats *(3 sets, 4-6 reps)*, Deadlift *(3 sets, 4-6 reps)*, Bench Press *(3 sets, 4-6 reps)*, Barbell Row *(3 sets, 8-10 reps)*, Military Press *(3 sets, 4-6 reps)*\n\n\nMy purpose with posting is to perhaps help some other girls/guys out there like /u/sknick_ / helped me, and show them the amazing progress that is possible with weight-lifting!\n \nThanks for looking guys!

It's extremely unfortunate, as all the material I am quoting is his and not mine. I thought about it and in the end seeing how the post has been so appreciated by the community I decided it would be the lesser of two evil (between deleting the post, or deleting the author's name). However I don't feel really feel comfortable about it, so I don't know if I will leave the post up. \n\nAnyway thank you so much again! You can always ask in the comment-section and I will happily answer! :)\n\nPEACE OUT \n\n//Tramsar", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "What 3 months of heavy lifting and CC did to my butt!

As it ended on a Tuesday, I finished out the week, completing a total of 33 days of the challenge.\n\nThree weeks ago, [I shared all the details about the eating and workout plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/46fxfr/im_eating_and_training_like_dwayne_the_rock/), so I won\u2019t repeat it here.\n\n**TL;DR SUMMARY**\n\nAfter eating 5300 calories a day for 33 days, more than 23 hours of cardio, and almost 80lbs of cod!, I gained a total of 1lb. After over 28 hours of weight training, I got leaner and gained some muscle in my upper arms (most triceps), upper legs (mostly quads), my upper chest (you can see it pulled my chest up). Here are the [before and after photos](http://imgur.com/a/BxKRy). \n\n**THE ROCK\u2019S RESPONSES**\n\nI blogged every day during this month and a few articles got written about the challenge. They came to the attention of The Rock, who had a few things to say on Twitter about it. He doubted me at first, but then came around. [Here are screengrabs of The Rock\u2019s tweets](http://imgur.com/a/Mt6uG). \n\n**LIFTING RESULTS**\n\nI got stronger, though I hadn\u2019t done much isolated lifting in years, so definitely a lot of beginner gains here. I probably increased weights around 10-15% or so. Just to pick two random exercises for an example:  In the beginning of the month, I started the incline bench at around 115lbs (4x12/10/8/6), and now it starts at 150lbs. I was originally doing the 200 reps of leg press at 160-180lbs, now it\u2019s at 220-240lbs. \n\nOne change to the workout: in week 3, the lack of ab work became quite apparent, so I added 3 ab exercises: leg raises, russian twist, and stir the pot. More details are shown in the Google doc below.\n\n**SO NO WEIGHT GAIN?**\n\nApparently not. I didn\u2019t skip a single meal, ate every bite, and had nothing else besides this food the entire time. I thought I would put on a few pounds, so getting leaner was a surprise. I had never really subscribed to a pure \u201ccalories in, calories out\u201d belief, and this experience killed it for me. It\u2019s more than how much you eat, what you eat makes a huge difference. [Here\u2019s a photo gallery showing meal prep](http://imgur.com/a/bjcLT).\n\n**HOW I FELT ALL MONTH**\n\nTerrific. Even with so much food, I never felt overly full. Every morning I would do 50 mins of cardio, then eat 10oz of cod, 2 cups of oatmeal, and 2 hard boiled eggs (at the gym!) then weight train. I always used to work out on a mostly empty stomach (just a shake) so I thought this would make me nauseous, but it felt good.\n\nEven with all the workouts, I never felt sore. All the food seemed to be fueling my recovery. Even the little aches and pains of being in your late 30\u2019s went away. I also was serious about stretching/foam-rolling at the end of the workouts, so I didn\u2019t feel very tight either.\n\n**WAS IT WORTH IT?**\n\nI decided to do this as a challenge to myself, to see if I had to discipline to wake up at 5am everyday, do all these workouts, prepare all this food in advance, eat every meal, have no cheating, and live my normal life. I have no aspirations to get huge like The Rock, and 30 days wouldn\u2019t do it anyway. Overall, it was an extremely positive experience, and I highly encourage everyone to push themselves to try something new for a month.\n\nIf I had to do it over, the only change would be to take a ton of measurements, pictures, body scans, blood tests, etc beforehand. Would have been nice to quantify it more. There seems to have been a nice change in my body fat %, would have been great to have those numbers (anyone want to make estimates?).\n\nWould I suggest this plan to others? If you\u2019re chasing the physical results, you\u2019re almost certainly better off putting together a routine and meal plan specifically for you. It\u2019s also extremely expensive, at $42/day. While cod is an excellent source of low calorie, low fat protein, that benefit doesn\u2019t outweigh the cost of, say, chicken breast.\n\n**WHAT IS WORTH INCORPORATING?**\n\nYou could probably eat more, as long as it\u2019s the right foods. Experiment with increasing your protein and overall calories with good, clean food, and see what happens.\n\nThis is personal preference, but I liked doing cardio first, then weights, which I had never done. It\u2019s a good warmup, and it\u2019s nice to be done for the day after you lift that last weight.\n\nMastering efficient food prep is key. Not having to decide what you\u2019re eating at every meal is a pleasure, and not having to cook it. And with practice, you get a ton of return on your time investment. I can make 18 meals in about an hour now. I\u2019ll keep prepping food every few days.\n\nI have eaten mostly keto for years, but man, oatmeal is delicious. Starting every day with it moving forward.\n\n**WHAT\u2019S NEXT**\n\nI want to follow a more sustainable version of this program for longer, starting with another 30 days. So far, I\u2019m doing the same workouts 5x a week. I changed up the diet to have 5 meals, no cod, and comes in at 3579cal/451C/59F/294P. So far, I have noticed I\u2019m getting a bit sore now, in a way I wasn\u2019t before, so I\u2019m going to keep experimenting here to come up with a better version. \nIf there is interest in me sharing that diet, or putting up an update post after following a tweaked plan for 30 days, let me know. Or if anyone wants more detail on any specific piece of this, let me know.\n\n**DOCUMENTS TO SHARE**\n\nIn case anyone wants to try any of this, here is the [full meal plan and workout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h7TpQ4tM98jihx2gUrFWRH4EtOucPTiFfmPU1-hnA4A/edit?usp=sharing) in a handy Google doc (I have this saved to my phone and followed it at the gym),\nAlso, here are the [food costs, nutritional info, and a data dump from my Fitbit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FefRW39jUk3TmwWE6brxiSp6cbvQ-yEjD2Cf1G43F24/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nQuestions, thoughts?

When I first began this journey i had no idea where to start. I'm going to highlight all my strategies that have worked in the hopes of helping someone who is in a similar predicament.\n\n\n---------------------\n**Stats**\n---------------------\n---------------------\n\nSex: Male\n\nAge: 27\n\nHeight: 5\u201910\u201d\n\nBefore: **[240lb](http://i.imgur.com/JEKYYNg.jpg)**\n\nAfter: **[160lb](http://imgur.com/5qPbxJR)**\n\n**[Face gains](http://imgur.com/teT7BJ6)**\n\n---------------------\n**Recap and update**\n---------------------\n---------------------\n \n* Back in 2011 I was an **[obese, depressed, alcoholic, smoker.](http://i.imgur.com/JEKYYNg.jpg)**\n\n* After becoming fed up with my sloppyness and lack of dates, I started dieting and **[running on a treadmill.](http://i.imgur.com/NJWhPjM.jpg)**\n\n* I lost 80lbs, quit smoking and drinking and got **[really skinny.](http://i.imgur.com/CQtMdX7.png)**\n\n* Having lost so much weight, I had accumulated some **[loose skin.](http://i.imgur.com/mIFxjAB.png)**\n\n* Luckily, I am privileged enough to afford the surgery to remove said skin so I took the dive and **[got the surgery.](http://i.imgur.com/XLGMNYs.jpg)**\n\n* After the skin had gone I finally felt I could achieve a beach body and decided to enter a physique competition, more as a challenge to myself than anything else. **[Here I am on stage in October at the Iron Man Natural.](http://i.imgur.com/5qPbxJR.jpg)**\n\n* **[Here is the full album from the event.](http://imgur.com/a/clV63)**\n\n* Since the competition I have transitioned into my first **intentional** bulk ever. The mental aspect of this is incredibly difficult. Keep in mind I have been dieting consistently for almost 4 years. To reverse that mentality and actually welcome weight gain has proven to be a challenge. \n\n* The beginning of the bulk was awesome. I was still lean from my competition but started filling out from the increased calories. **[This gym selfie](http://i.imgur.com/qtrJ7YZ.jpg)** I took got featured on a fitness motivation **[Instagram account.](http://instagram.com/p/vZeZnUjecV)**\n\n* At the beginning of this year my local gym asked me if I would model for them as they needed pics for a new gym website. I wasn't expecting this opportunity and was not as lean as I would have liked. I agreed to the photo shoot and tried my best to dehydrate and carb load.\n\n* **[Here is the full album.](http://imgur.com/a/hRjtL)**\n\n\n---------------------\n**Diet**\n---------------------\n---------------------\n\n* I've tried almost every diet and had some success with a few of them but the philosophy I choose to follow today is that of IIFYM or counting macros.\n\n* Counting macros is not a diet per se but more a way of eating that makes you aware of what you are ingesting. To count macros you use a calorie counter to track all the foods you eat and then look at the macro nutrient breakdowns of those foods and eat in an intentional way that will hit your goal number of carbs, fats and proteins. In this way you can still subscribe to a more food specific diet but doing so with this strategy makes you conscious of your macros.\n\n* For my show prep I did a classic bodybuilder prep diet consisting of tilapia, brown rice and broccoli. Although I was not IIFYM dieting, I did calculate the macros to be **45 fat, 145 carb and 225 protein(1,885 calories)**. I got incredibly lean doing this but it was unnecessarily difficult.\n\n* After the competition I began increasing my calories slowly by about 15 carbs and 3 fats a week. This is called a reverse diet and it's purpose is to allow your body to adjust to increased calories without putting on excess fat. My current lean bulking macros are **60 fat, 400 carb and 200 protein(2,940 calories)**. I've gained a total of 20lbs since beginning this increase. **[Start](http://i.imgur.com/bryeDrv.jpg)** and **[now](http://i.imgur.com/PBVRnCD.jpg)**\n\n* **Supplements:** creatine, fish oil, multivitamin. I have never used steroids or pro-hormones.\n\n\n---------------------\n**Training**\n---------------------\n---------------------\n\n* Towards the end of my show prep, when I was reaching low single digit body fat percentages, my strength took a steep dive. Since my show, I have been focusing much of my time in the gym on strength.\n\n* I do Jim Wendler's Boring But Big 5/3/1 strength protocol. Here is a link to **[the program](http://www.jimwendler.com/2013/05/boring-but-big/)** and the **[5/3/1 calculator](http://blackironbeast.com/5/3/1/calculator)**. This program is for intermediate lifters. My favorite beginner program is ICF 5x5. **[Here is a graphic with the specific exercises](http://i.imgur.com/RmTpFHC.jpg)**.\n\n\n\n\n**Current one rep maxes:**\n\nOHP: 145lb\n\nSquat: 315lb\n\nBench: 240lb\n\nDL: 405lb\n\n\n---------------------\n**Motivation**\n---------------------\n---------------------\n\n* **\"How do you stay motivated?\"** This is the most frequent question I've received from my reddit posts and it\u2019s difficult to answer.\n\n* Originally my motivation was to look better and not be ignored by girls. This kept me going for a while but if that were my only motivation I would have fallen off a long time ago. Today my motivation is intrinsic, it comes from within. Lifting weights is part of who I am. It\u2019s not something I try to get out of the way any more. I cherish my time in the gym.\n\n* In the early days, to get through times of low motivation, I made the gym part of my routine. If I didn't think about it, I wouldn't think my way out of it. After work everyday I went to the gym on my way home. Instead of being home from work at 4:30, I was home at 5:30 because I went to the gym first. Making myself go was the hardest part.\n\n---------------------\n**Things I wish I had known**\n---------------------\n\n---------------------\n\n* **Cardio<Weights<Diet** - This is the order of importance if an aesthetically appealing physique is the goal. Diet is the most important part of gaining or losing weight. To gain or lose weight in order to achieve an aesthetic figure, weight training is paramount. Cardio is a tool to use in conjunction with diet and weights to help achieve a caloric deficit.\n\n* **Tracking** - If your goal is to achieve an aesthetic physique, tracking is a must. Tracking your diet, body weight and the weights you lift gives you the ability to view progress and analyze the variables. Being able to manipulate these variables is essential to break through plateaus. MyFitnessPal is great for tracking.\n\n-----------\n\n-\nA couple years ago I was sitting on my computer reading posts like this one, wondering if it was possible for me to do the same thing. It ***was*** possible for me and it ***is*** possible for you too. I am not naturally a fit person. The success I have found has come from consistent positive choices.\n\n-\nIf you are thinking about starting your own fitness journey, **DO IT**. You'll be glad you did. The way I feel is great, the way I look is awesome but the biggest difference is the way I'm treated today. I feel a sense of respect from complete strangers and people seem to **WANT** to talk to me. I'm still getting used to it, but it's awesome.\n\n-\nI'll answer any questions you may have. I'm an open book. I have no secrets.\n\n\n-\n\n**TL;DR [Before](http://i.imgur.com/JEKYYNg.jpg) and [after](http://imgur.com/5qPbxJR)**\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Clinically obese to ripped (part three)", "post_ups": 7524, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2wbm1a/clinically_obese_to_ripped_part_three/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:08.475838", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "reditttr", "post_created_utc": 1457977293.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1457982769.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "4ae4w4", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 340, "post_num_crossposts": 1, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 7403, "post_selftext": "Thought I might share these two videos that have helped me fix my posture.

Reading transformation posts on r/fitness is what got me started on my journey and I hope my own transformation post can inspire others to do the same. I owe a debt of gratitude to this community and would like to pay it back by helping others achieve what I have achieved. I will answer any question you may have. So ask!\n\n\n\n---------------------\n**Stats**\n---------------------\n---------------------\n\n\n\n**Sex**: Male\n\n**Age**: 28\n\n**Height**: 5\u201910\u201d\n\n**Before** : **[240lb](http://i.imgur.com/JEKYYNg.jpg)** (2011)\n\n**After**: **[173lb](http://i.imgur.com/pADfU13.jpg)**  (2016)\n\n\n\n**[Face gains](http://i.imgur.com/0cXs0DZ.jpg)**\n\n\n---------------------\n**Recap**\n---------------------\n---------------------\n\n \n* Back in 2011 I was diagnosed as prediabetic and **[clinically obese](http://i.imgur.com/WEZ1S8U.png)**.\n\n* I wanted to lose weight so I started lifting weights and tracking macros.\n\n* I lost 80lbs and was left with **[loose skin](http://i.imgur.com/mIFxjAB.png)** and got it **[surgically removed](http://i.imgur.com/XLGMNYs.jpg)**.\n\n* After the skin was gone, I decided I could finally get over my fear of taking my shirt off in public, so I entered a **[bodybuilding competition](http://i.imgur.com/5qPbxJR.jpg)**.\n\n\n---------------------\n**Update**\n---------------------\n---------------------\n\n\n\n* **The bulk** - After the competition, I decided I wanted to add size and get stronger, so I started eating in a way that would increase my bodyweight and in turn also increase my strength and size. This is called **bulking**. \n\n* **[The first bulk got out of hand](http://i.imgur.com/0I3iD1X.png)**. Although my strength had incresed a lot, when I cut down I realized that **[I hadn't gained much size](http://i.imgur.com/9qWVcCe.png)**. \n\n* **Controlled surplus** - I learned that the amount of muscle I grew during a bulk was not necessarily proportionate to the amount of weight I was gaining. Our bodies can only create a small amount of muscle at a time, so there is no benefit to being in a large surplus of calories versus a smaller surplus of calories. The only difference is the amount of fat that is stored in addition to the muscle in a larger surplus. The important thing is to be in a surplus. This means taking in more calories than you expend in order to allow your body to adapt and get bigger and stronger.\n\n* **Current condition** - I have since been bulking and cutting for a couple years. I have found a groove where I relax my diet during the winter months and eat how I want while tracking my macros to make sure I am getting sufficient protein. As a naturally fat person, this results in weight gain. I then cut during the spring or summer months. Here is my most recent **[winter bulk (8 months) and summer cut (10 weeks)](http://i.imgur.com/c2Cf5tk.jpg)** \n\n\n\n---------------------\n**Diet**\n---------------------\n---------------------\n\n\n* As a formerly obese person, I have tried or been prescribed just about every diet out there. What I have found to be most effective is the idea of energy balance. If your goal is to gain weight, you must eat more than your body requires. This is a caloric surplus. If you want to lose weight, you need to eat less than your body requires. This is a caloric deficit. If you want to maintain your bodyweight, you must eat around the amount your body expends in a day. This is called maintenance.\n\n\n\n* **Maintenance** - In order to diet (gaining or losing) you must first find your maintenance calories. You can use a calorie calculator like **[this one](http://mytdee.com/)** to help estimate this number but this is only an estimate and you will need to use trial and error to find your own personal maintenance.\n\n\n\n\n* **Tracking weight** - How I find my maintenance calorie intake is by weighing myself daily and taking my weekly averages. If my average weight from 2 consecutive weeks is around the same, I have found my maintenance calories. It is a moving target and will not be the same at the end of a cut as it was at the beginning of a cut.\n\n\n\n* **Tracking calories** - Once I know my maintenance calories, I can gain weight by adding calories to that number or lose weight by subtracting. When I begin a gaining or losing phase, I always start with increments of 500 calories at a time added onto my daily calorie goals. If I was maintaining my weight on 2500 calories a day, I would begin my diet on 2,000. I subtract these calories from carbs and fats. The tricky part is tracking accurately. I use **[MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com)**.\n\n\n\n* **Macros -** In a caloric surplus, as long as I am getting enough protein (0.8 to 1 gram per lb of bodyweight), it does not matter where the rest of the calories come from. In a deficit on the other hand, it can be important. If I am dieting, I always make sure to have at least 50 to 60 grams of fat. I have gone below 50 and I felt horrible. I keep my protein static year round and I eat as many carbs as my goals will allow. I like food.\n\n\n\n* **[bulking macros](http://i.imgur.com/U7c5YXG.jpg)**: 450 carb/190 protein/75 fat\n* **[cutting macros](http://i.imgur.com/pADfU13.jpg)**: 250 carb/190 protein/60 fat\n\n* **Supplements:** creatine, fish oil, multivitamin, whey. I have never used steroids.\n\n\n\n---------------------\n**Training**\n---------------------\n---------------------\n\n\n\n* **Strength training** To increase size and strength it is necessary to practice progressive overload. This is the idea of handling a higher workload overtime. The easiest way to do this is by focusing on strength. For this reason, I suggest starting out with a strength routine. I have done a couple strength routines in the past including **[5/3/1](https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101065094-5-3-1-for-a-beginner)** and **[Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.com/get-started/programs)**. These are great routines.\n\n\n\n* **Bodybuilding** - Over my lifting career, I have gravitated towards bodybuilder style lifting. I lift relatively heavy weights with an emphasis on stretching the muscle at one end of the rep and squeezing the muscle at the other end. I find that I feel good doing this and do not get injured. Most importantly, I enjoy it. By doing this day in and day out, I do gain strength (progressive overload) although not nearly as quickly as I would with a strength routine.\n\n\n\n\n**Current maxes:**\n\nOHP: 185lb 1RM\n\nSquat: 365lb 3RM\n\nBench: 275lb 3RM\n\nDL: 405lb (last tested over a year ago)\n\n\n\n---------------------\n**But how??**\n---------------------\n---------------------\n\n\n* **\"How do I motivate myself?\"** This is the most frequent question I've received from my reddit posts and it\u2019s difficult to answer. I don't know what motivates anyone else. For me, I got sick and tired of being sick and tired. I read every transformation post on r/fitness over and over again until I had an idea of what to do and I finally took action. After that, I fell in love with this lifestyle. I no longer need to stay motivated because this is just what I like to do.\n\n\n\n* **Make it routine** - When I was obese, I worked 40 hours a week and was very tired when I got home. The last thing I wanted to do was drive another 20 minutes to the gym. What I did instead was brought my gym clothes with me to work. I changed in the bathroom at work and stopped at the gym on my way home. This way it wasn't a choice. I did not need strong willpower every day. It was just part of my routine. The hardest part is often just getting to the gym.\n\n\n\n---------------------\n**Lessons learned**\n---------------------\n\n---------------------\n\n\n\n* **Cardio is not necessary for weightloss** - In the begining of my journey, **[I ran on an elliptical every day and I hated it](http://i.imgur.com/NJWhPjM.jpg)**. What I didn't know at the time was the idea of energy balance. Cardio worked because it increased my daily energy expenditure and forced me into a deficit. What I wish I had known was that those 300 calories I was burning every day on the elliptical could have just as easily come out of my diet. One less pop tart would have had the exact same affect on my physique. \n\n\n\n* **Tracking accurately** - Diet is the most important aspect of fitness. The way we look, feel and perform comes down to diet above all else. In order to control this aspect, it is important to be able to track it accurately. For me, this took a lot of practice. A behavior of mine that contributed to my obesity and still hinders my diet sometimes is unconscious eating. I stand in front of the fridge or a cupboard and shovel food into my mouth without even recognizing it. By tracking everything that enters my mouth I am able to recognize unconscious eating and stop myself before I start. Tracking my diet, body weight, pictures and the weights I lift also gives me the ability to view progress and analyze variables. Being able to manipulate these variables is essential to achieving my goals.\n\n-----------\n\n\nIf you are thinking about getting started on your own fitness journey, do yourself a favor and begin today. My only regret is not starting sooner. I have found a new way of life in fitness and it has allowed me to achieve things I didn't think were possible for me. Thanks again for all the support. I am truly grateful for this subreddit.\n\n\n\nAsk any questions you may have.

My friends still encourage me and said \"you know even though you lost you still lost 60 lbs which is incredible you should still keep trying!\" and I was like \"you know what? you guys are right!\" So I tried going back, but it felt different, I didn't feel the same motivation as I did before and I didn't last long and kept on failing over and over and started to slowly gain my weight back and was depressed and went MIA. because I felt so ashamed. Years passed by and I moved to Saint Louis to work at my cousins restaurant to start my life anew, to find myself and then one night...I skyped with one of my best friends and when I saw him I was so shocked, because he been trying to get fit too and he looked amazing, he progressed so much and I was like wow....and we talked and he gave me good advice encouraging me and etc. All night I was thinking \"wow....I'm really jealous, think i could've looked like that? what if I never gave up, what if I actually stayed on tracked..I don't think I can do it..\" but the next morning something happened..I felt something different inside me and I was like you know what....I don't wanna feel this way anymore! No more What ifs! I'm going to get my ass up and go back to the gym! The first week there....I finally felt it...the motivation that I had before except this time it was stronger, this time I'm not going to give up, I won't fail this time, I'm going to turn those dreams into reality and I felt an endless amount of motivation flowing inside of me and was able to push my self beyond my limits and even surpassed my weight goal of 200 and got to 190 and i feel great!\n\nI made a facebook video telling my whole story here, because I want to encourage people to never give up and achieve their goals!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ChrisKittavong/videos/1497362106954441/?l=8153277874841881366\n\nNo matter how many times you fall, always find the courage to stand back up again and keep pushing forward!

Okay so here goes:\n\n###What is the ketogenic (keto) diet?\n\nThe ketogenic diet is not intended to be a temporary diet for weight loss, although it works great for that, but it is more of a lifestyle change where you consistently and drastically reduce the amount of carbs you ingest. It not only makes you burn fat for energy (more on that below) but helps you become very aware of how rampant and ubiquitous carbs are in this day and age.\n\n###Why is it called ketogenic?\n\n* The word ketogenic is made up of two words: keto- and -genic.\n* The prefix \u201cketo-\u201d is short for ketones.\n* The suffix \u201c-genic\u201d is the same as genesis, which refers to \u201cthe creation of something\u201d\n* So the word ketogenic literally means the \u201ccreation of ketones.\u201d\n* Ketones are created from the break down of fat for energy when the body doesn\u2019t get enough carbs.\n* When the body is creating ketones, it is said to be in a state of ketosis where fat becomes the main source of fuel for energy rather than sugar (glycolysis).\n\n###What the fuck are ketones?\n\nKetones are like water-soluble fat molecules that can cross the blood-brain-barrier and provide energy for the brain.  There is this myth where people say that you MUST eat carbs because the brain can only survive off carbs or glucose. What they don\u2019t know (or conveniently forget to mention) is that the brain operates perfectly on ketones as well.  Think of them as the 4th macronutrient after carbs, protein and fat.\n\n### How is ketosis achieved?\n\nKetosis is achieved by practicing strict carbohydrate restriction consistently. The general limit is about 25-50grams of net carbs a day which is far lower than the typical 200-300grams most people ingest per day.  (Net carbs are carbs minus fiber.) Those carbs must be replaced with healthy fat sources. It takes a few days for ketosis to actually occur because you have a glycogen supply to get through initially, but one can reach ketosis faster if they exercise.\n\nNote: One can also reach ketosis if they starve themselves completely of all foods, but that is not ideal or recommended. What we're after is not starvational ketosis but nutritional ketosis which is achieved in the same fashion by simply restricting carbs.\n\n###What are the benefits of being in ketosis?\n\nThe promises of a ketogenic diet are quite impressive:\n\n* Helpful for metabolic syndrome (obesity) and preventing diabetes\n* Increased meal satiety and appetite blunting. This diet is more satiating than a low-fat diet and tends to makes it easier to avoid caloric overconsumption.\n* Greater rate of fat loss due to state of ketosis rather than glycolysis.\n* Note: You literally become a fat-burning machine.\n* Reduction or complete elimination of Type-2 Diabetes (Reduction in insulin resistance)\n* Reduction or complete elimination of hypertension (high blood pressure).\n* Improved lipid fat profile: LDL (the bad cholesterol) particle size increases which is a good thing. (The smaller ones cause more damage.)\n * [The SIZE of LDL particles may be more important than concentration of LDL cholesterol.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20531184)\n * Recent studies have shown independent relationships of levels of LDL size to risk of heart disease.\n* [Prevention of various cancers and reduction of cancer growths.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3267662/#!po=0.217391)\n * The mitochondria of cancer cells are damaged and require 200x the normal amounts of glucose to replicate at rapid rates. They cannot utilize ketones and cannot survive in ketosis without the presence of excess glucose.\n* [Possible treatment for Alzheimers.](http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1743-7075-6-31.pdf) ([another study\\)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19090989)\n* [Possible treatment for Parkinsons](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15728303)\n* [Improved memory for older adults](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21130529)\n* [Reduction or complete elimination of chronic systemic inflammation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3267662/#!po=0.217391)\n* A ketogenic diet has profoundly anti-inflammatory effects.\n* [Improved cardiovascular health](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/132/7/1879.abstract)\n* Very high muscle-sparing effect. (Muscle loss is mitigated in ketosis even at a caloric deficit!)\n* Proven treatment for epilepsy, more effective than current medications without the side effects.\n\nYou can extrapolate that if it\u2019s helping reverse the diseased conditions of people with Type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease, epilepsy, Alzheimer\u2019s and so forth, that it may PROACTIVELY help those of us who are not afflicted by those conditions and want to avoid them!\n\n###Before I continue: The ketogenic diet is NOT a panacea\n\nThe truth is that there is not a single, perfect diet that works for everybody.  In regards to this diet specifically, [Dom D\u2019agostino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWRnma8Tet0) says that this diet is excellent for ~70% of people out there but ~30% of the population does not respond well to this diet. Btw, Dom D\u2019agostino is the expert that originally got me hooked to trying keto. He calls ketones the 4th macronutrient in[ this podcast with Tim Ferris.](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/11/03/dominic-dagostino/)\n\n* Weight loss is NOT guaranteed on keto. You still need to be wary of your total intake of calories and counting your calories/macros is recommended until you figure out the diet. But after a lot of experience, many people find the keto diet to be liberating because they are able to maintain the diet without the need for calorie counting by consistently choosing only keto-friendly foods.\n\n###Why do you have to restrict the carbs so sharply? How does the body transition to burning fats for energy?\n\nI wrote a ton on that topic and I'm just summarizing here so here's a tl;dr infographic: http://i.imgur.com/HeEYexT.png\n\n###So\u2026 What are carbohydrates?\n\nCarbs are sugar. Sugars are carbs.  There are simple carbs (monosaccharides) and complex carbs (polysaccharides). There are also sugars found naturally in foods and extra sugars added artificially to foods. In the context of a ketogenic diet, they\u2019re all pretty much the same because the body eventually breaks them down into their simplest forms regardless. (The carbs that you will eat will come almost entirely from veggies or nuts on this diet.)\n\n### Don't we need carbs for energy?\n\n* Despite your body needing to break down carbs first and foremost when they are ingested, carbs are NOT an essential nutrient.  An essential nutrient is one your body needs to survive because it won\u2019t be able to make it on its own.  But your body readily creates sugar from fat and protein to regulate blood sugar levels.\n\n* Many people think they need carbs to perform at their very best performance-wise, but that\u2019s not true either. It takes a few weeks, but after someone becomes completely adapted to the ketogenic diet, they become very, very efficient at burning fats for fuel and the bandwidth or throughput within which your body can do this at is great. It\u2019s been ingrained in us that we need carbs to survive, or perform at our peak as athletes. We see sugar as energy. We see athletes drink Gatorade, so we think we can\u2019t perform at our best without it. We almost rely on it as a crutch. But when you\u2019re keto-adapted you are not chained to the hypoglycemic rollercoaster.\n\n**I'm only a quarter way through the article and it's only summarized the key points but the rest of the article talks about** \n\n* What's wrong with carbs\n* Which foods are high in carbs: all grains/bread, rice, pasta, cereal, starchy veggies, potato chips, vegetable chips, pita chips, cookies, crackers, ice cream, pudding, cakes, donuts, soft drinks (none of it!) and fruits/fruit juices (except berries and avocados).\n* A rebuttal to people who say, \"I like food too much.\"\n* How to calculate how many NET carbs a food has (total carbs minus fiber)\n* What to eat if you don't eat carbs?\n* How sustainable is such a relatively restrictive diet? How do you eat out?\n* Can you get all the proper nutrients off of it? How does one create a well formulated keto diet?\n* Isn't this diet expensive?\n* What are all the pros/cons of this diet?\n* Progress pics \n * **calories in/out only:** [eating at a simple deficit in 2013, I lost fat AND muscle](http://i.imgur.com/VRZuLsa.jpg)\n * **keto only:** [but on the keto diet, because it is muscle sparing, I lost fat AND retained muscle](http://i.imgur.com/FImPVTe.jpg)\n\n* **Again, this was only an abridged version of the whole thing. If you want to read the full article with photos and full text, go here: [All About the Keto Diet: A Beginners Guide](http://antranik.org/keto-diet/)**\n\n* And please remember that diets are an extremely complex subject. There is no perfect diet and it's not all about just doing something for weight loss. Diet is influenced by culture, religion, social influence, family, ethics... for some it's as simply as drinking soylent and nothing more. For some, they view it through a lens of biochemistry and physiology and geek out over metabolically hacking their body. It's all about finding out what works for you. On the keto diet, I was able to sleep well and have good recovery between strength/skill training sessions and felt a constant state of mental focus (I still do, I've been keto for like 3 months straight now with 5 months total experience), so it's nice to be able to share what it's all about, in case it jives with anyone.

If she makes herself something, she will make two and give one to my younger brother.

I plateaued at ~175 lbs and couldn't seem to make much more progress. It was then that I began seriously reading these forums and discovered all types of things involving nutrition and fitness; most importantly, counting calories. I decided I wanted my abs to be visible. I learned that for this to be possible, a body fat of ~10% or less was required. So in June, I downloaded MyFitnessPal and began counting my calories. It was also then that I adopted a vegan \"diet\", at first for nutritional benefits, and now for all sorts of reasons. \n \nMy average caloric intake over this period ranged from 1,500 to 2,300 per day; I was experimenting for the first three months or so. Now it seems as though 1,800 - 2,000 allows me to lose the amount of fat that I'm comfortable with. Here are my most current dietary goals:\n \n----------\n \n##**DIET**  \n\n**CALORIES PER DAY:** 1,800*\n \n* Protein: ~110g\n* Carbs: ~300g\n* Fat: ~70g\n\n* *Calories per day was my goal with cardio included. I am realizing the macros don't add up.*\n \n###**FREQUENT FOODS**\n \nBreakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks weren't planned whatsoever. I would pretty much just eat throughout the day whenever I was hungry. The key was sticking to reasonably low calorie foods and keeping the cheat meals at a minimum:\n \n* Cereal\n* Bananas\n* Baked beans\n* Boca burgers\n* Gardein products\n* Tofurkey products\n* NuGo protein bars\n* White or brown rice\n* Lightlife smart dogs\n* Steam-in-bag vegetables\n* Soy, almond, coconut, and flax milk\n \n###**CHEATING:**\n \n* Whiskey\n* Craft beer\n* Taco Bell (I know)\n* Diet soda (not really a cheat, but kept my sanity)\n\n###**SUPPLEMENTS:**\n \n* Creatine\n* Beta Alanine\n* Various types of soy, rice, pea, and hemp protein powders\n \n----------\n \n##**EXERCISE**\n \nI've been doing PPL (Push/Pull/Legs) for the last seven weeks, with this last one consisting of a deloading phase. Here are my daily routines for the first six weeks:\n \n**MONDAY:**\n \n*PUSH (chest / shoulders / triceps)*\n \n* Bench: 195 lbs (5x5)\n* Shoulder Press: 90 lbs (5x5)\n* Tricep Pulldown: 60 lbs (5x5)\n* 1-3 mile run\n* Abs (ab roller, planks)\n \n**TUESDAY:**\n \n*CARDIO*\n \n* 3-6 mile run\n \n**WEDNESDAY:**\n \n*PULL (back / biceps)*\n \n* Deadlift: 175 lbs (5x5)\n* Chin Ups: Body weight (5x5)\n* Cable Row: 100 lbs (5x5)\n* Dumbbell Alternate Curls: 40 lbs (5x5)\n* 1-3 mile run\n* Abs (ab roller, planks)\n \n**THURSDAY:**\n \n*CARDIO*\n \n* 3-6 mile run\n \n**FRIDAY:**\n \n*LEGS (quads / hams / calves)*\n \n* Squat: 155 lbs (4x6)\n* Calf Raise: 245 lbs (4x6)\n* Dumbbell Lunges: 40 lbs (3x10)\n* Abs (ab roller, planks)\n \n**SATURDAY:**\n \n* OFF\n \n**SUNDAY:**\n \n*CARDIO*\n \n* 3-6 mile run\n \n----------\n \n##**REFLECTIONS, LESSONS LEARNED, & ADVICE**\n \nTo be brief, there are two very specific things that influenced my change and neither of them involve fitness. If you care to know, they are the films of [Terrence Malick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrence_Malick) and the music of [Tool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_%28band%29), specifically \"[Lateralus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralus)\".\n \nI mention those unrelated influences to highlight the fact that a desire for a \"nice body\" isn't necessarily a prerequisite to significant physical, mental, or emotional health. I wanted my *life* to improve. Those two things were my conduit, but I soon did realize that my health would eventually need to improve at least *somewhat* for me to be comfortable. Hell, my original goal weight was 185! When I reached that, I kept going. I felt a hunger and addiction because the results were tangible and I could feel myself changing in every single way, all for the better.\n \nIn reading these forums, the one thing I've taken away is this: *Do not believe everything you read here or anywhere else*. There are absolutely wonderful things here, especially in the FAQ, and certainly from various posts I've read over the last six months; but do not believe or adhere to any one thing. *Experiment* with your own body. Do not be discouraged if something is working wonderfully for someone but doesn't seem right for you. It's incredibly discouraging to strive so hard at something and fail miserably. I will tell you that I've tried countless different exercises and routines (both dietary and physical) and am just now starting to figure my body out. \n \nA long time ago I read someone say, \"Anyone who has exercised for less than five years is a beginner.\", and I called complete bullshit on that statement. Now, though, two years into this myself, I am starting to see his point. Your body is so complex that it's utterly mind-boggling. So many people want such a quick fix. It simply doesn't work that way. It takes effort. It takes time. It takes dedication. If you allow these three things to work in conjunction with one another, you *will* see and feel results.\n\n----------\n \n##**MOVING FORWARD**\n \nThis week I have started a 'clean, slow' bulk. That is to say, I'm eating 250 cals above maintenance, upping my protein, and following P.H.U.L. (Power-Hypertrophy-Upper-Lower). My plan is to do this for three months, cut back down for three more, and see what I've managed to accomplish. I have never been more excited about any aspect of my life than I am for these next six months. Although it was not the original spark, fitness has absolutely changed my life.

I would have thought at this surplus it would have led to putting on some weight. But I\u2019m noticeably building muscle while getting leaner.\n\nPodcasts and Audiobooks! This is how I spend 2+ hours in the gym 6 days a week. Music just doesn\u2019t hold my focus for that amount of time. I also feel like I\u2019m getting smarter and bettering myself in the process.\n\nI feel great. I\u2019m 37, around the time when mysterious aches and pains pop up. Eating like this is preventing any muscle soreness or DOMS. And I\u2019m lifting heavier than I had in awhile. Makes me realize I definitely haven\u2019t been eating enough, and that sometimes your body needs high glycemic carbs (something I\u2019ve avoided for years).\n\nEating like The Rock isn\u2019t cheap. It\u2019s costing me about $42/day, putting this whole experiment at a monthly budget of almost $1300. It\u2019s mostly the cod that gets you, that alone is $18/day.\n\nThis experience has been eye-opening for me, especially how the nutrition is affecting my workout.

Stretching the hip flexors will help your hips **have more hip extension** (read: the ability to bring your thighs behind you without arching the lower back to compensate). \n\n* Lunges are a commonly prescribed basic stretch if someone is having lower back pain, because the iliopsoas complex (deep hip flexor) connects the thighs to the lower back, and if they're tight they pull on the lower back. Doing it in a low lunge is a very good start toward stretching them.\n\n* The cues in the video (squaring, tucking, etc) are applicable to **ALL** hip flexor stretches, including high/standing lunges or the couch/wall quad stretch and so forth.\n\n###Here is the [Link to the YouTube Video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGEpQ1BRx-4) Let me know how you like it or have any questions!\n\n###Edit: If you had trouble listening to the video cause the background music was too loud, [here's the version without background music.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NITPD0beV74)\n\n**tl;dw:** I teach you how to square the hips (remember, it's always back-hip forward, front-hip backward), then my favorite way of getting people to tuck the hips (posteriorly tilt the hips using your hands) and small but important details like making sure the back foot is in line with the mat/carpet and the front foot is ahead of the knee and so on.\n\n-----------\n\n**Edit: The support has been overwhelming...ly awesome!

For a long time, consistency was the biggest problem I had with my workouts. I struggled because I would go all out for a couple of weeks, then get tired, quit, and have the same body I\u2019d always had. \n\nWhen I started studying psychology, both in college and on my own time, I realized that I could use what I was learning to help me work out more consistently. Since then, I\u2019ve gained 40 pounds of lean muscle. Of course I eventually learned a lot more about training, but it all started with that consistency. \n\nI wanted to write this guide to help anyone who\u2019s struggling to make exercise a habit. It might also help people who have trouble getting their gym buddies to pony up and tag along. \n\nThe guide is split into two parts:\n\n* Part one covers the basic psychological tactics that you can use to make exercise a part of your daily routine \u2013 without relying on willpower\n* Part two puts those tactics together into a concrete plan. In 5 steps, you\u2019ll come away knowing exactly how you can achieve your goals.\n\nPart one tactics include chaining (connecting your workouts to other events that you know will happen), precommitments (planning to work out well ahead of when you actually go to the gym), rewards (how to use small, consistent rewards instead of large ones), and barrier reduction (how to get rid of what stops you from working out). \n\nHere's [a quick overview infographic](http://imgur.com/E5pPmva) of the 5 steps in part 2. \n\n* In step one, you'll set a specific, actionable goal that lends itself to a clear and specific path of action. \n* In step two you'll set subgoals, along with times to check in on your progress towards your ultimate destination\n* In step 3 you'll identify the specific problems that might stop you from achieving your ultimate goal\n* In step 4 you'll plan ahead, figuring out ways to address your specific roadblocks\n* Step 5 puts it all together. You'll come away with one piece of paper, your roadmap, that details exactly how you'll reach your destination    \n\nI hope you find this helpful! \n\nPsychology has had a huge impact on my life, and I\u2019m happy to answer as many questions as I know the answers to.\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "I made a guide to help you stop being lazy and consistently get in the gym", "post_ups": 6320, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/49ubxy/i_made_a_guide_to_help_you_stop_being_lazy_and/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:08.475838", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "fire_water76", "post_created_utc": 1487284473.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1487437046.0, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "5uieeu", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 762, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 6283, "post_selftext": "I'm 28 years old and 5'8\". Last year, I challenged myself to go to the gym for a whole year. By \"every day\" I mean every day of my scheduled work outs, which was around 5-6 days a week.\n\n\nThe only days I missed were 2 weeks where I went on vacation. \n\n\nI started out at 195 lbs last Feb, finished my cut last Oct at 157, and completed a bulk recently at ~167. \n\n\nThe 8 month long diet was the worst experience I've inflicted on myself, and that alone is motivation to never get fat again.\n\nMy current goals are to get stronger. I want to hit the 1k club by September. \n\n[Progress pics](https://imgur.com/a/eh0Vn)\n\nMy lifts improved from: last Feb -> Oct (end of cut) -> now (end of bulk)\n\nThese are 1 RM's:\n\n- bench: 115 -> 185 -> 225\n\n- deadlift: 185 -> 300 -> 360\n\n- Squat: 155 -> 250 -> 295\n\n- OHP : 85 -> 105 -> 135\n\n**Routines:**\n\nFeb16 - Apr16 - [StrongLifts](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/) : changed to SL. I always get SS and SL mixed up. The two programs are pretty similar.\n\nApr16 - May16 - ICF\n\nJune16 - Oct16 - [Reddit PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) \n\nNov16 - Now - [2Sun's 5/3/1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nSuns/) with [my accessories](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5fzkmi/program_critique_2suns_531_with_accessories/)\n\nMy takeaways: \n\nStrongLifts:\n\nGreat program designed to get people lifting who have not done so before. The program itself is so simple, and the initial time commitment isn't big. ICF is just SL + curls. Either program is fine. \n\nReddit PPL: \n\nOnce I started to enjoy lifting weights, I looked for a program that had me going more frequently. I had a lot of fun doing this program, as it got me going to the gym to lift more frequently. I think new lifters will be able to get a lot out of it, but once you hit numbers that bump you to intermediate level, there are better programs.\n\n2Suns 5/3/1:\n\nMy favorite program. I was able to make very consistent progress on this. The initial volume made me feel like shit, but my body got used to it after 2 weeks. I never thought I could hit a hit a two plate bench, but somehow that happened after 3 months of doing this.\n\n**Diet:**\n\nI try to eat flexibly. When bulking and cutting, I aim for around 1 lb a week. \n\nMy first cut was at a very severe deficit (1.5 - 2 lbs a week), but now that I'm a lot leaner, I can do a more normal deficit.\n\n150 g protein, split up carbs and fat\n\nbulk: 2.8-3k calories\n\ncut: 1.8k\n\nFoods: chicken, pork, steak, cat, eggs, rice, lentils, beans\n\nI'm Asian, so I stuck to eating mostly rice, stir fries, with a lot of baked or grilled meats. For both cutting and bulking, I try to eat as clean as possible and cook my own food on weekdays, but on weekends, I go out to eat and eyeball. I don't drink any alcohol.\n\nReally appreciate this subreddit for having useful advice. I literally just followed what the wiki told me to do and in the end, I'm pretty happy with my results.\n\nThe biggest change to my everyday life is the improvement of my posture. I'm a software engineer and you can see my caveman posture in the first pic. I used to get back pain randomly and I was just terribly out of shape since I was fat. Now, my posture has improved significantly and I rarely feel tired anymore.\n\n\n[Proof: some months I hit 31, the least # of times I checked in was in 20 in Dec due to holidays](https://imgur.com/a/2FpXu)\n\nEDIT: this received a lot of replies, I will try to reply to every comment asking for specific questions on what I did. Thanks for the gold. \n\n**Frequent questions and answers:**\n> Did you do any cardio?\n\n* Yes - [Graph of steps over time](https://imgur.com/a/Ef1Zr) - My cut ended in Oct, so I stopped doing as much cardio. \n\n* I only did low impact cardio like elliptical or incline walking. My heart rate is around 120. I set the resistance to a setting where it's comfortable enough where I can spam \"Well played\" in Hearthstone using one hand and not fall off.\n\n* I do cardio when I bulk and cut. Obviously more during a cut. I use the HR reader from my fitbit to gauge my cardiovascular health. I started off between 70-80 RHR. Now it's between 50-55 normally, and 55-60 during a bulk.\n\n* My commute to work involves walking a bit. I walk probably 4 miles a day minimum. \n\n> Diet specifics?\n\n* [Graph of weight over time](https://imgur.com/a/u85i2) - the visualization here smooths over, but if you connected the actual data points, my weight spikes up and down every day by 1-3 lbs\n\n* IIFYM. Weight loss is all about calories. Learn to not let everyday flucs demotivate you. Certain foods cause bloat and water retention. Sodium and carbs are the biggest culprits. I've lost as much as 5 lbs of water weight overnight before. You need to track calories accurately, as well as weigh yourself daily and use averages as a benchmark.\n\n> What program should I pick?\n\n* Consistency >>>> program. A \"bro\" who consistently goes to the gym on a 5 day bro-split will make much better progress than someone who's half assing their way through an optimal program. Pick whatever program you enjoy doing and fits into your schedule. \n\n* Any good program has progression built in. If you aren't increasing the weight week after week, you will not get stronger.\n\n> Random thoughts about training. \n\n* Learning to safely fail and not have to use a spotter helped the most. For my AMRAP sets, I do them until literal failure. For squats, this might mean that I can't push up and have to set the barbell on the metal handles. For bench, this means I usually do the roll of shame once a week. Having a spotter is nice, but you can't expect to have a spotter every time you work out.\n\n* Don't let failure demotivate you. People go through ruts in life. Stress might cause you to not lift as much as the week before. You need to get over failure and accept that it's a natural part of life and progression. \n\n> Supplements\n\n* fish oil, creatine, caffeine, ephedrine, zma, vitamin D\n\n* Don't take EC (caffeine, ephedrine) or ANY drugs without doing research on what the effects are. Always start with a small dosage to assess tolerance. If you have preexisting heart problem, don't take this. \n\n* http://www.livestrong.com/article/117527-risks-eca-stack/", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "I went to the gym every day for a year.

[Here is a comprehensive explanation of lane swimming etiquette  if you are inclined](https://loneswimmer.com/2011/02/15/lane-swimming-etiquette/).\n* Ask or let the swimmer already in the lane know you are joining.\n* Don\u2019t start swimming or turn in front of a faster swimmer.\n* The fastest swimmer has the right of way.\n* Stay aware of what everyone is doing to avoid collisions and frustration for all.\n\n**Goggles**\n\nBecause every swimmer in the world has an opinion and will happily entertain long discussions about goggs.\n\n* No anti-fog will last on goggles longer than a couple of months\n* Spit into googles for a simple reasonably effective anti-fog. Never touch the inside of the goggles.\n* Use a 2/3 water, 1/3 baby shampoo mix, swirl it around and rinse it out for a more effective anti-fog\n* Most \u201chigh visibility open water goggles\u201d aren\u2019t high visibility and are seriously over-priced. The google design offering the most visibility are clear Swedish goggles (aka Swedes). Which are also the cheapest.\n* More expensive goggles does not in any way mean better. Blame triathletes for the escalation of costs. The best goggles I\u2019ve bought in years were \u20ac4 in Lidl the summer before last.\n* There is no such thing as a generic \u201cbest google\u201d answer. Competitive swimmers/online swimmers most often respond Vanquishers  or Swedish Goggles. Vanquishers are not available in Europe anymore & Swedes (Which I wear myself in the pool and [I show you how to fit here](https://loneswimmer.com/2013/06/26/how-to-swedish-goggles-fit-and-review/)) aren\u2019t a good idea for beginner swimmers. I also wrote [this article about understanding the different kinds of goggles](https://loneswimmer.com/2015/02/04/how-to-understand-and-choose-between-the-different-types-of-swimming-googles/) so you can choose based on your own requirements rather than other\u2019s opinions, because I had never once seen anything like this by any of the goggle manufacturers, or anyone else.\n* Silicon straps don\u2019t last long. Bungee straps are a great replacement.\n* Two thirds of my swimming time is spent with my face underwater exhaling. I can see everything including guys jerking off, teenagers and older couples fiddling with each other and numerous erections.\n\n**Technique (Front crawl)**\n\nThe name of the stroke is front crawl. Freestyle means that in competition you can swim any stroke, and since crawl is the fastest, it (mostly) gets used, so a lot of swimmers think crawl is freestyle and visa versa. Someone will probably even say in the comments here that no-one calls it front crawl. Front crawl is extensively used outside the US and is the accurate term.\n\nBLABT  is the acronym for the process most swim experienced teachers use to evaluate stroke and teach front crawl. It stands for:\n\n* **B**ody position\n* Get horizontal in the water. Not being horizontal is the most common reason for swimming slow.\n* Push your chest forward and down into the water. Try to swim downhill!\n* Keep your head low and steady, don\u2019t allow it to swing to the side. Imagine you are an a rotisserie spit that enters through your forehead, your whole body rotates around the centre point. If you raise your head, it\u2019ll cause the rest of your body to sink.\n* Clench your butt cheeks. (Core muscles are used for position and rotation, doing this helps engage them).\n\n* **L**egs\n* In an elite swimmer, the maximum propulsion that comes from kicking is only 15% of overall speed. But to do that requires the body\u2019s largest muscles and disproportionate amount of energy. (Long distance swimmers like myself do very little or no kicking).\n* Fixing the kick is important for beginners so the legs don\u2019t slow you down or cause you to sink. Kicking wildly (especially common in runners or triathletes) is more likely to cause you to slow. This is also part of the horizontal body position above. From what I have seen most triathlete swim coaches get this completely wrong and spend far too much time focusing on a better kick.\n* You are not riding a bicycle. Kick from the hips, with only a little movement in the knees. New swimmers often have a big wide kick or their legs sinks, or both. This slows them down.\n* While reading this, see if you can point your toes like a ballet dancer. If you can\u2019t, start stretching your ankle while watching TV or while sitting at a desk. Not being able to point your toes while swimming is like pulling a weight behind you.\n* Try swimming with your toes clenched into a fist. [Yes, just like Die Hard](http://die%20hard%20make%20toes%20into%20fists/). This will stop you kicking from the knees. You won\u2019t be able to do it all the time, but it will help you understand what your position and kick should feel like.\n\n* **A**rms\n* Reach forward. Further still.\n* Pull back underwater. But only when your palm is facing backwards behind you, not when they are facing the bottom. This called the Catch, when your hand starts effectively pulling.\n* Keep pulling, then pushing backwards until your thumb scrapes your thigh.\n* Try to always keep your elbow above your hand, at every point in the stroke. * This is not easy, and take a long time to get right.\n\n* **B**reathing\n* Exhale underwater\n* Hum a little to get used to controlling your breath and exhalation\n* Try sinking to the bottom of the pool with no arm or leg movement. This will help you learn breath control. Only do this when there is a lifeguard present.\n* Rotate your head out of the water, don\u2019t lift it. Don\u2019t look forward or around. There is no forward visibility as part of standard front crawl, and learning this is a separate activity.\n\n* **T**iming\n* Both arms and legs alternate and all actions are smooth and continuous.\n* Breathing is to the side.\n* Rotate your hips to drive your arms to reach forward.\n\n**Swimwear**\n\n* Buy your swim suits one size smaller than the size you think you should wear based on your street clothes because water causes fabric to expand. You can\u2019t see it but others can.\n* Wear your swimsuit in the shower after your pool swim, it\u2019s easiest way to wash out the chlorinated water. Suits will last up to four times longer. * Polyester suits lasts longer than chlorine tolerant fabric, and feels largely the same.\n* Swimsuits are currently in a \u201cshrinking phase\u201d, that is, getting smaller. Male briefs are becoming more thong like with very narrow side panels, female racing suits are getting cut much higher at the rear. You can find different cuts, but it can sometimes take a bit of work.\n* Never wring the water out of your swimsuit, it will weaken the fibres and seriously reduce its longevity. Simply squeeze it or use a suit spinner if there is one available.\n* Baggy board shorts should not be used. Beginner and many intermediate swimmers have problems with drag. Board shorts add even more drag and make improving your stroke even more difficult.\n* If you insist on using baggy shorts, please wear something tight underneath, because I have seen too many scrotums and assholes and I\u2019m not even a paid professional.\n* How you look or feel in a swimsuit does not correlate with how well you swim.\n* There are three materials for swim caps: cloth, latex and silicone. Cloth is comfortable but otherwise useless, usually used by hotels to keep patrons from getting hair in filters. Latex lasts moderately well but snags hairs more. Silicone which is most expensive lasts longest but is also thickest and may be too warm for some people. No swim cap lasts for ever though. I never get more than a year from a cap.\n* Swim caps will last longer if your dry them between uses, and better yet sprinkle with talcum powder.\n* If you have a problem with the swim cap coming off your head while swimming, look for ones which have parallel ridges running around the inside edge.\n\n**Pool Hygiene**\n\n* Pool swimming took a leap forward in the 1960s once reliable swim googles became widely available and training sessions for Olympic swimmers were able to last for 3000 metres or even a whole hour! \n* Goggles are essential for pool swimming because most pools use chemicals to make the water safe. [I have a longer post explaining the interactions of pool chemicals and people in more detail here](https://loneswimmer.com/2013/06/14/how-to-why-you-should-always-shower-before-you-use-the-pool-and-why-you-shouldnt-pee-in-it/).\n* Pools that have a strong chlorine or chemical smell are LESS clean than pools that have little or no odour.  The less the chemical smell, the cleaner the pool water.\n* Pool-water colour has little relationship to pool water quality. Most pools use pool tiles to make the water look blue. Some even add small amounts of copper into the water for the same reason. \n* Just because you\u2019ve read that swimmers pee in the pool doesn\u2019t mean you have to. But if you do want to stay being a swimmer, you should probably reconcile yourself to the fact that you are absolutely swimming in dilute urine. If this is really troubling you, best of luck with your sex life.\n* It may not be chlorine that\u2019s making your eyes burn. The pool may have the wrong water acidity (high or low). Soda-ash is added to pool water to control this.\n* Of course, if there are too many organics (sweat, urine etc) in the pool, then more chlorine must also be added to balance the pool.\n\n**Food & drink & peeing**\n\n* Cold air in the pool deck or changing rooms, cold showers etc, evaporation of water from skin all cause the skin temperature to drop. This raises blood pressure as less blood flows and the hormone that suppresses urination is reduced. All this causes you to need to pee more. It\u2019s completely normal.\n* Therefore swimmers need to be more careful about hydration. Experienced swimmers will always drink during training.\n* Yer Mammy was wrong. You can swim after eating.  All marathon distance swimmers like myself have to eat/take nutrition during swims for example. However, your body will be using air to digest food and use energy for exercise at the same time, so you will feel sluggish at best.\n\n**Effort & Diet**\n\n* It is extremely common that new swimmers, regardless of or more likely due to prior experience in other sports, underestimate the overall difficulty of swimming and overestimate how much energy they are expending. If you haven\u2019t mastered breathing and are desperately out of breath this does not mean you expending significant energy.\n* Calorie consumption rates in swimming given by website, apps or wearable fitness trackers or watches cannot be trusted because the variables are too varied. Weight, water temperature, stroke, experience, rests, set and session duration all play a part. I could say it\u2019s almost certainly less than what any of those are telling you for an hour swimming.\n* Pools are lower than body temperature and conduct heat away. So your body does start using energy to retain heat. The effect lasts after the swim is over. This makes swimming an appetite enhancer. Swimmers notoriously eat a lot. For beginner swimmers, you need to learn to control this.\n* Most people with a good but average diet will have sufficient energy in blood and liver stores to sustain two hours of high intensity exercise. So it is not essential to \u201cpre-load\u201d in advance of daily swimming\n\n**How much should you swim?**\n\n* How much you should swim depends obviously on your goals. However since swimming is technically difficult skill, it is safe to say than more swimming is better.\n* But how much? As a general guideline I recommend four times a week, 2000 metres at a time is a good aim. Beginners won\u2019t be able to swim anywhere near this distance, so let\u2019s say 40 minutes a session.\n\n**Injury & other physical problems**\n\n* \u201cSwimming is low impact sport, with little chance of causing injury\u201c. This is a widely repeated misconception. Apart from the obvious, front crawl injuries to the shoulders do occur, caused by overuse and poor technique. You can get injured with only a small amount of swimming.\n* The best ways to reduce the risk are to improve your technique and ALWAYS do a little backstroke each session. Backstroke is a stabilising exercise for front crawl. It helps strengthen the opposing muscles in the shoulder muscles to assist in keeping your shoulders balanced. It does not have to be a good technique to be effective.\n* Does sleeping on your side cause discomfort? The cause is almost certainly tendonitis. This will not get better by itself, or with rest or by reducing swimming. I recommend some deep tissue massage, direct icing and physiotherapy, in that order as required, with massage & ice fixing ninety percent of problems.\n* Water in your ear is easiest dislodged by bouncing on the heel of the leg on the same side as the water. If this doesn\u2019t work, have a shower and stand with your ear up under the water. If this doesn\u2019t work, try a drop of rubbing alcohol (surgical spirit). Wear ear plugs if this is a repeat problem.\n* Asthma prevalence is correlated to regular swimming. The simplest and most effective treatment is to use your Daily Preventer, that you may not want to use daily.\n* Chlorine sensitivity causes very runny nose, sneezing, sore, red or streaming eyes. The simplest and most effective treatment is to use a nose clip. They take about one day to get used to, and are 100% effective.\n\nOkay folks, I'm off to the pool My log resest itself from last year's million metres and I'm once again back to the start.\n\nSecond small edit. Doubtless there will be questions. Since I'm in Ireland and I am going swimming, and it'll be llate late after I finish, I'm not going to be able to answer much, sorry. There are more than sufficient swimmers here now to be able to answer most any question.\n\nRemember the best swimmer in the one having the most fun!\n\n(Small edit: I've been asked about my flair here previously. Waay back in the early aeons of r/fitness when all the mods were different, the then mods applied flair to some contributors to indicate their expertise in particular areas. I was then the only Channel swimmer here at that time).\n\nI\u00e4! I\u00e4!

Everything in moderation, my fridge and freezer have everything in them, but I eat less of it. Ice Cream, beer, pizza, chicken, burgers, mcdonalds etc. Instead of one Mcdouble and a large diet coke, i'll eat 1 mcdouble with no drink or fries. If i feel like ice cream such as a mcflurry or dairy queen, instead of jumping in the car, i'll get my boots on and walk to the restaurant so i'm burning half the calories just getting there and back.\n\nTotal calories in the day is about 2200-2400\n\nExercise : This is what I do.\n\nSunday : Bench 5x5 + 2x15 and then throw in skull crushers or just tricep pull downs on the rope.\n\nTuesday : Deadlifts or just back exercises like seated rows or dumbbell rows + biceps(usually sloppy curls in the mirror)\n\nWednesday : Bench 5x15 and then shoulder press, either in the squat rack as a standing military press or I use a machine.\n\nSaturday : Squats, I change it up a lot on this day, my favorite is the paused front squat, seems to burn the most.(I pause right at the bottom for 3 seconds) As for sets and reps, always changes.\n\nBefore every workout I walk on the treadmill for 30 minutes at 15% incline @ 3mph, that according to the treadmill burns 880 calories an hour. If i'm short on time, i'll run at 13mph for 20 seconds, rest for 40 seconds and rinse and repeat for 6 running sessions\n\nI'm not old but i'm not young either, so my max lifts fluctuate with my weight and food in-take, I find injuries crop up as I get older. Max lifts are, bench is 325lbs, deadlift is 505lbs and squat 405lbs, depending on my in-take and weight. \n\nOne of the biggest pros to all of this is my energy levels and confidence, this might seem very stupid, but your dick does look bigger when your lose weight, if that isn't motivation enough I don't know what is, unless your huge already :/\n\nMy waist dropped from 40 to 34, and even now I can get a thumb or two in the jeans so i'm more like a 33, so its easier to find clothes, another benefit.\n\nHope you all can find your own method and motivation.\nedit, thanks for the gold! wow.\nand the pic difference is 3 years, \n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Fat to Happy", "post_ups": 6233, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7mh3m6/fat_to_happy/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:08.475838", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "combustion_assaulter", "post_created_utc": 1422986070.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1422996869.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2unp71", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 1356, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 6217, "post_selftext": "Here's the article:\n\n http://grapevine.is/news/2015/02/02/hafthor-julius-breaks-1000-year-old-lifting-record/\n\nHaf\u00fe\u00f3r J\u00fal\u00edus carried the 650 kg and 10 m long log for 5 steps.\n\n\n\u201cWell, today my friends, I made history!\u201d Haf\u00fe\u00f3r J\u00fal\u00edus wrote on his Instagram account following the win. \u201cAs well as winning the title of The World\u2019s Strongest Viking for the second time in a row, I carried this MONSTER LOG 5 steps!

Do what works for you, but this is my journey!\n \nBACKSTORY (not pictured): I was a skinny kid until I hit puberty and went from skin and bones to fat, my heaviest I've weighed was 73kgs (I'm 5'7\") or 160lbs and I was so so unhappy. At the end of high school I hurt my body, was depressed and ended up just not eating. I dropped about 20kgs or 45lbs in just under a year. I lost A LOT of weight, my period, but I gained what I though was happiness.\n \nDIET: basically a whole jar of nutella erryday.\nWEIGHT: 73kgs / 160lbs\n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMOVING LEFT TO RIGHT\nFIRST PIC: was taken in 2014, just before my 21st birthday.\n \nI was starving myself, unhappy and struggling with depression. My skin was tired and you could see all of my ribs, but I was bloated 100% of the time and had severe reactions to eating wheat / dairy because I had restricted them from my diet for so long. I had literally given myself an intolerance to food.\n \nI was a cardio whore, and did nothing but HIIT workouts or long 10km + walks, I didn't know anything about strength training and thought you achieved the 'perfect body' by eating nothing and working out 24/7.\n \nI remained this way for over 2 years!!!!!!! :O\n \nDIET: lots and lots of salads, low fat yogurt, and high protein, fruit but still low carb\nWEIGHT: 52kgs - 56kgs / 120lbsish\n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nSECOND PIC: taken about a year ago, I was going to the gym and did HIIT workouts both in classes (like body pump) or on my own. I gained confidence to start making my own workouts, but still though cardio was the only way to look long and lean. I wanted a six pack so so so bad! I was still terrified of eating carbs, and I would think about eating all the time - perpetually hungry and getting nowhere.\n \nDIET: carbs in my breakfast, i.e. muesli but pretty much the same as the above. But I was eating MORE of it\nWEIGHT: 58kgs\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nTHIRD PIC: taken January 2017. Old habits die hard, I had just gotten back from a 4 week trip to Canada and the US. I thought I would get fat by enjoying christmas a little toooo much so I restricted my eating. I got horribly sick with a few chest / ear infections, and was walking around 25kms per day - obviously not good for the body and I'm so sad that I did this.\n \nDIET: I was eating out every day basically for a month, and was enjoying noodle soups, bagels and chocolate - but wasn't eating a ton\nWEIGHT: not sure, but roughly around 57kgs\n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nFOURTH PIC: taken in May 2017. My best friend has been doing weights for a few years now, and had encouraged me to give it a go. I was skeptical at first but I LOVED the way my body felt, strong and sexy so I switched gyms and we started going daily. We both made a commitment to eating MORE food, including a healthy portion of carbs with EVERY meal and to keeping each other on tracker. I was eating around 2300 calories per day\n \nDIET: we slowly INCREASED CARB INTAKE from around Feb 2017 onwards (still going lols), to try and REPAIR YEARS OF DAMAGE that we had already done.\nI would eat a mostly large carb / protein breakfast - large as I workout in the morning only - yes I wake up at 5AM, and yes I sleep by 9PM :) I would eat carbs and lunch and then mostly protein and whatever fats I had left over\nI was tracking macros to make sure I was EATING ENOUGH, and not convince myself that I didn't need to eat things\nI started enjoying chocolate, and savory food - can you believe that I thought making a cheeesy sandwich would kill me and now I devour about 10million a week?\nWEIGHT: 60kgs /  132lbs\n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nFINAL PIC: taken today. I'm happy, I'm healthy. I feel full and strong. I can squat 150lbs 4x10, deadlift 1RM 100kgs and can run for miles. I can do chin ups and the abs are slowly poking through as I do a mini mini cut for summer (I live in Aust). My butt is finally cooperating and stubbornly growing cm by cm.\n \nI lift about 5 days a week, following a body upper and lower (2x LOWER and 2 x UPPER /  1x whatever I feel like). I ride my bike to and from work, or walk. I enjoy my strength and am keen to see where I am in a year's time from now.\n \nDIET: I've just started a mini mini cut, so sitting at around 1800 calories per day. I eat around 150 C, 140 P, 70 F but really just eat whatever I feel like and don't count calories. I used to be terrified of carbs, but now they make up for the most of my meals and my body responds so well. Yes I gained some fat, but it's SOOOO much easier to lose now I know what I am doing. \nIt's about eating in a deficit or surplus, nothing else. Forget carbs, protein and fat. You either eat MORE or LESS than you need - but make sure you do it safely as it has taken years to realize.\nWEIGHT: 65kgs (AND I HAVE ABS) yes, real abs poking through\n \nTLDR;  I was unhappy and now I am happy. Do what works for you, but this is my journey!\n \nI've written a wall of text but I wish someone had told me this stuff in the beginning, but then again what's life without a few mistakes?", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Female fitness journey :) from 160 - 120 - 143lbs!

How does it work?**\n\n* When someone gives you a deep tissue massage, they use their palms/fingers/elbows to apply pressure to help relax tight muscles and make you feel better. A lacrosse ball is a fairly hard, dense ball about the size of a tennis ball that helps mimic this deep release massage with your own bodyweight.\n\n* The best part is that you could go to town on your **glutes and hamstrings** in a way that not even many massage-therapists will because of how intimate that area is.

I knew when I made the gifs, it looked a bit crazy with me staring at the camera... but... I was like, whatever, it is what it is I guess. I enjoyed making them though. The way I go about making them is by clipping a tiny section of me going from one direction to the other, putting it into photoshop (file-import video frames to layers), then from the animation tool bar, find the arrow to select all layers, then paste layers after last frame, then reverse pasted layers (this is in animation toolbar), delete middle frame and last frame cause those are redundant, and then export as video, upload to gfycat, rinse repeat.

(109 kg)\n* Current weight: 200 lbs. (91 kg)\n\n######TL;DR\nDecided to get healthy, and in shape before I turned 30 years old, and did something about it. Lifted weights, counted my calories, and worked hard. No special diet program, just simple stuff that almost anyone can do.\n\n##Summary\nA little over 9 months ago I looked at myself in the mirror (literally, and figuratively), and I didn't like what I saw. I was a 29 year old, very overweight, lacking motivation, and confidence. My energy levels were low, and I knew it was effecting my family (wife and kids). I was tired of it, and wanted to finally do something about it.\n\n________\n###Phase 1: Lose Fat ASAP\n######March 2015 \u2013 June 2015 (3 months)\n* **Eat Healthier, smaller portions** \u2013 I knew I was super over weight, so I needed to lose fat. I used [LoseIt App](https://www.loseit.com/), and counted everything that went into my mouth. I calculated my TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) using online calculators, and adjusted my calories about every 2 weeks.\n* **Lift Weights** \u2013 I started lifting weights with a friend of mine who had already been lifting for a few years. He taught me the ropes, and helped introduce me to some starter routines. During Phase 1, I did a basic Push, Pull, Legs (PPL) routine. I split this between 4 days per week (M, T, R, F).\n* **Light Cardio** \u2013 I did about 15 minutes of cardio 2-3 times per week after lifting weights, just for some cardiovascular health, and to help with the weight loss.\n* **Macronutrients** \u2013 I aimed for about 200g Protein daily, and then didn't really count my carbs or fat.\n* **Calories** \u2013 I ate anywhere between 1800-2000 calories a day.\n* **Example Daily Meals** \n* Meal #1, 4 egg whites, 2 eggs, cereal\n* Meal #2, 6oz. Chicken, sweet potato, veggies\n* Meal #3, Preworkout: Protein Bar\n* Meal #4, 8oz Protein, carbs, and veggies\n* **Cheat Meal** \u2013 Every 7-10 days, I'd have a cheat meal. Note: NOT A CHEAT DAY. Just a meal. This meal I would eat whatever I wanted, as much as I wanted. Usually it'd be a couple greasy burgers, chinese, or a pizza. These meals gave me a little something to look forward too, and also helped push off my weekly cravings.\n* **Favorite Meal**: [Qdoba](https://www.qdoba.com/). You can get a LOT of protein packed into very little calories, if you order right. I love Qdoba.\n* **Ending Weight**: 198 lbs. \n\n###Phase 2: Gain Muscle\n######June 2015 \u2013 October 2015 (3 months)\n* **Eat a lot** \u2013 I like to eat, so this phase was much easier for me. I actually probably gained too much weight, too quickly, and I will be changing that in my future \"bulk\" phases.\n* **Calories** \u2013 I aimed for about 3300-3500 calories per day.\n* **Example Daily Meals** \n* Meal #1, Lots of eggs (8-10), protein shake, and cereal\n* Meal #2, 8oz. Chicken, sweet potato, veggies\n* Meal #3, 8oz. Beef w/ noodles\n* Meal #4, Protein bar, PB&J Sandwich\n* Meal #5, 8oz Protein, carbs, and veggies\n* Meal #6, Before bed: Yogurt, or cottage cheese\n* **Macronutrients** \u2013 My goal was about 220g-250g Protein per day, and filled the rest of my calories with carbs and fats.\n* **Weight Training** \u2013 Because I had so much more energy, I added in another day in the gym. So I began going 5 days per week. I gained a lot of strength during this phase too, which I attributed to the amount of calories I was consuming, and better form/technique that I had been developing with the help of my friend.\n* **Challenges** \u2013 People talk about dirty bulks vs. clean bulks. Dirty bulking is obviously easier, and much more enjoyable. You basically eat everything you see, without regard for anything. I probably fell somewhere in between dirty and clean. I think it's good to find a balance, because if you do it too dirty you'll end up gaining quite a bit of fat. Like I did.\n* **Cardio** \u2013 None.\n* **Favorite Meal**: Donuts for breakfast, and Burgers for lunch. Ya, not healthy at all, I didn't eat this every day. \n* **Ending weight**: 232 lbs \n\n###Phase 3: Cut the weight, reveal gains\n######October 2015 \u2013 December 2015 (3 months)\n* **Calories** \u2013 Basically went back to what I was eating in Phase 1. 1800-2000 calories per day. With a cheat meal every 7-10 days.\n* **Trying to keep strength** \u2013 I really feel I have my routine, and form dialed in right now with my weight training. Currently I'm doing a split that is kind of a mixture of a PPL, and \"Bro-split\". I really like it, and I feel exhausted after every workout, which is good.\n* **Cardio** \u2013 I try to do cardio once per week, but honestly I often skip it. I'm really trying to get more consistent, because I know that it's good for my cardiovascular health. But it just hasn't been top priority for me.\n* **Current Weight**: 200 lbs.\n* **Weight left to lose**: ~15 lbs.\n\n________\n\n##What Motivated me?\nHonestly my biggest motivation came from wanting to prove myself wrong. All my life, I've just accepted that I was overweight, and that it was pointless to try and do anything about it. I ate food for comfort, and when I was stressed. Every time I went to buy clothes, I dreaded it, because I knew nothing would fit \"just right\". I hated looking at myself in pictures, and always secretly felt embarrassed.\n\nI wanted to prove to myself that I could do it, and that **it doesn't have to be complicated**.\n\n##So what's next?\n1. Enjoy life more with my family, friends. Get out and do things that I could/wouldn't do previously. I just want to be the best I can for them.\n2. Take my shirt off this summer, and feel confident!\n3. Keep losing weight! I'm wanting to diet down to about 10% bodyfat, and then start another bulk phase. This time, doing it more clean!\n4. After this time I've spent working on my diet and training, I've really gotten into bodybuilding, and I considering trying to compete in the future. I know I'm still a long ways away, and I'm pretty old to begin competing, but I don't care. I just want to give myself a new challenge.\n\n##Biggest thing I learned?\n1. **Failing is ok** \u2013 I had many days where I felt I had \"failed\". But I had to keep reminding myself why I was doing what I was doing. So the next day, I would just start over, with a clean plate, and get back on track. I had to remember that it was a \"marathon\", not a \"sprint\". Failing is ok, just get back up the next day, and move forward.\n2. **It doesn't have to be complicated or expensive** \u2013 Honestly the biggest thing I learned is that getting in shape isn't rocket science. No matter what anyone tells you. All these instagram fitness coaches, supplement businesses, and \"weight-loss magic\" sellers, are just trying to make money. Some of their products might assist, but none of them are a replacement for hardwork in the gym, determination/commitment, and a balanced diet. I didn't follow any \"special program\". I just stopped stuffing my face with food all the time, and starting going to the gym a few times per week.\n\n##Final thought.\nWas it difficult? Yes, many days were struggles to go back to the \"old me\". Would I go back to how I was before? No way in hell.\n\n________\n\nFor those interested, here is a simple breakdown of my current weight lifting program. I do this 6 days/week, Monday-Saturday.\n\n* Day 1: Chest, Quads\n* Day 2: Back, Hams, Glutes\n* Day 3: Shoulders, Arms\n\n#####Edit 1: Adding More Training Details\n\n######Basic Workout Breakdown:\nThis is a basic example of what my average workout looks like. Some days I'll sub in different exercises, but this will give you a good starting point.\n\nWorkout A | Workout B | Workout C |\n---|---|----|\nFlat Bench 4x10 | Deadlift 4x10 | BB Military Press 4x10 |\nIncline Bench 4x10 | Wide-grip Pulldown 4x10 | Narrow-grip Bench 4x10 |\nCable Chest Fly 5x12 | Seated Row 4x10 | DB Shoulder Press 4x10 | \nDB Chest Fly 5x12 | BB Row 4x10 | Tricep Cable Ext. 5x12 |\nBB Squat 4x10 | Facepulls 5x12 | Overhead Tricep EZ Bar 5x12 |\nLeg Extension 5x12 | Leg Curls 5x12 | Preacher Curl 5x12 | \nCalf Raises 5x12 | BB Hip Thrusts 5x12 | DB Curl 5x12 | \nAbs | \u2013 | Abs |\n\n######Weekly Split:\nI basically rotate my workouts like this on a weekly basis. (Note: when I'm in a cutting phase, I might take an additional rest day on Wednesday too.)\n\nMon | Tue | Wed | Thr | Fri | Sat | Sun\n---|---|----|---|---|----|----|\nA | B | C | A | B | C | Rest\n\n#####Edit 2: A couple more tips\n1. **Weigh yourself everyday!** A lot of people say not to do this, but I'm a firm believer in doing it. I believe it helps you get more familiar with your body, and how it works. You see, and understand the fluctuations in your weight throughout the week. If you only weigh yourself once a week, you could be weighing yourself when you're retaining a lot of water, or not retaining. And you could get discouraged if you are up a pound or 2 after a week of eating well. If you weigh yourself DAILY, then you see these fluctuations constantly. (e.g. of how my weight would fluctuate. I weighed almost every day for the last 9 months.)\n2. **Take at least 2 photos a week**, to track your progress. I can't emphasize this enough! The scale isn't always the best way to track your progress, as you can see from my progress pics. I weighed almost the same in my before, and after phase 2 pics, but my body composition was much different. If I had only relied on a scale, I could have been discouraged by this. But I had plenty of pics to look back and see.\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Hated how I looked, and felt... so I did something about it. 9 months progress (Pics, details, more)", "post_ups": 6072, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3yxetl/hated_how_i_looked_and_felt_so_i_did_something/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:08.475838", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "wile-ecoyote", "post_created_utc": 1426044312.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2yn1qv", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 1173, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 6077, "post_selftext": "So its nothing revolutionary but its the way you eat.

After: 24.5% (according to handheld ultrasound device).\n\n**Lifts - starting lifts, one rep maxes (1RM), recent e1RM**:\n\nSquat: empty bar (45 lbs/20 kg) -> 165 lbs/75 kg; e1RM 180 lbs/82 kg (based on 154 lbs/70 kg \\* 5)\n\nBench press: empty women's bar (35 lbs/15 kg) -> 94 lbs/42.5 kg (lol, FML); e1RM 105 lbs (based on 83 lbs/37.5 kg \\* 8)\n\nDeadlift: 100 lbs/45 kg -> 245 lbs/100 kg (hit this 8 weeks ago but haven't deadlifted much since, so no up-to-date e1RM)\n\nOHP: empty women's bar (35 lbs/15 kg) -> e1RM 85 lbs/39 kg, based on 72 lbs/32.5 kg \\* 6 reps (I'm awful at doing OHP for 1RM, so no way I could actually hit 85 lbs)\n\n\\-----\n\n# Background / how I got fat\n\nI never really had healthy eating habits. I went on my first crash diet when I was 12 (actually together with my parents, figures), gained \\~30 lbs as a teenager by being depressed and eating my feelings, developed a horrible eating disorder at 16 and underate and ran my way to a bodyweight of 127 lbs/58 kg. I moved away for uni in 2011 and when I let go of eating nothing as a coping mechanism for dealing with life, I gradually got Really Fat. I felt horrible about the weight gain, but not horrible enough to make lasting lifestyle changes and my many attempts to (crash) diet were always short lived. I got up to 202 lbs/92 kg within 2-3 years which is insane and also obese at my height. My MyFitnessPall history only goes back to the end of 2014, but since then alone, I made 8 unsuccessful attempts to lose weight.\n\nIn 2015 I graduated and moved to a different country to work at a company where all food is unlimited, magical and free. My weight fluctuated between 194 lbs/88 kg and 202 lbs/92 kg and I still felt awful. I had many excuses for being fat - I didn't want to get an eating disorder again, it's impossible to count calories when you don't cook your own food, I was really busy with my career, nothing I'd tried had ever worked, etc. but in July of last year, and after a minor health scare, I realised that losing weight would never be as easy as it was right now, being fairly young and having access to a great gym and healthy food at work.\n\n# Strategy: exercise & diet\n\n**What was different this time**: I realised that this time around, I needed a much better plan than before - not just counting calories but also regular exercise that I could stick with. If all you're doing differently when losing weight is having different eating habits, but the rest of your life is exactly the same, it's really hard to stick with it. I 100% believe that powerlifting is what has kept me on track for the last year.\n\n**For exercise**, I decided to focus on powerlifting because it allowed me to:\n\n* build muscle mass and burn more calories in rest\n* be in the gym in a productive and mentally healthy way (focusing on becoming stronger, rather than just skinnier, and having a quantifiable way to measure progress)\n* get addicted to said progress (them noob gains!)\n* it punished me if I missed a session, which made it really rewarding to stick to.\n\nI decided to jump on Phrak's Greyskull LP. I didn't know how anything worked in the gym, but I watched a lot of YouTube videos to educate myself on form, and just did kettlebell and dumbbell stuff for the first 1-2 weeks until I worked up the courage to ask some random dude in the gym to show me how the squat rack worked. I started lifting 3 times/week and stuck with Greyskull for about 4 months, making decent gains (more on this below).\n\n**In terms of diet**, I started counting/estimating calories and aimed to eat around 1200 - 1300 calories with 100+ grams of protein per day. Breakfast was usually high protein yoghurt with some oats in it, lunch was a salad with chicken breast, lots of low cal vegetables and sometimes some complex carbs and dinner was typically around 500-550 calories, the majority from protein. Lots of chicken breast, lean mince and turkey products. I found it hard to count/estimate calories at work (which is where I had all meals save for dinner), so I always tracked my dinners and weekends religiously and ate very similar things at work every day. As long as the scale kept moving in the right direction, I knew I was eating well. I'd usually have one cheat meal a week. Honestly, after the first 6 or so weeks, it really got surprisingly easy to lose weight consistently. Lifting and particularly the mental aspects of weight loss were a lot harder. More on how little calories I was eating below.\n\n# Progress and programming\n\n***Apologies for this being super long but I wanted to show my full experience of trying to become strong on a steep deficit.***\n\n**First 6 months of weightloss and training:** on Greyskull I got up to a 3x5 115 lbs/52.5 kg squat after 3.5 months (late October) and my deadlift went up to 160 lbs /72.5 kg x 5. Around this time I started hitting walls especially on bench and I decided to deload my squat to improve my form. I switched to 5/3/1 for beginners and made some decent gains again, though it took me all the way to January to bring my squat back up. I decided to add in cardio (running) 2 times/week after getting a Fitbit and seeing that my heart rate rarely went into the peak zone or even cardio zone. I also added in a lot more vanity accessory work (mainly focused on shoulders, arms and back) because it was around this time when I figured out I actually wanted to look swole (or as [r/xxfitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness) like to call it, \"hot and scary\"). At the end of the first 6 months of my weight loss, I was lifting 3 times/week and doing cardio twice, and I was down to \\~159 lbs/72 kg.\n\n**Hitting a wall due to eating too little**: around January - February, I was still eating around 1200-1300 calories, and I was grinding away quite hard - failing lifts often, pushing hard on the 5/3/1 FSL sets even if I couldn't complete them without some form breakdown, and this led to me hurting my rotator cuff, which is why part of why my bench still sucks. Rehabbed with help of a physio. After frustratingly grinding away some more and then meeting a powerlifting friend at work who talked some sense into me (thanks, senpai), I realized I needed to eat more to continue to make progress. I upped my calories to \\~1500-1600 and funnily enough more weight fell off than before, likely because the extra calories allowed me to train harder. At the end of this period (end of April) I was still lifting 3 times/week and doing cardio twice, mostly running.\n\n**Would I recommend eating this little?** In hindsight, I definitely should have upped my calories and increased my cardio and training intensity earlier (as to continue to lose weight) or I should have been less demanding of myself and my lifting progress. Yes, as an obese person you have a lot of room to make gains on a steep deficit especially at the beginning of your weight loss, but you will run out of easy gains and shit will get very tough. If I'd do it all again, I'd still start out at 1200 - 1300 calories, but I would have upped them earlier.\n\n**Maintaining & training for my first (mock) meet**: At the end of April I decided to maintain weight around 145 lbs/66 kg for a while because we had a powerlifting competition at work in early June and I wanted to train extra hard to hit my strength goals. I added in a fourth lifting day a week (an extra deadlift day) and changed my cardio to lower impact (stairmaster) to improve recovery. During this time I went from squatting 1 plate/135 lbs/60kg for the first time to squatting 165 lbs/75 kg at the competition in just 5 weeks - shows what you can do when you eat at maintenance! I also hit a 2 plate/220 lbs/100 kg deadlift (up from 187 lbs/85 kg in February) at the competition which was a long term goal. I found it a crazy mental struggle to eat at maintenance during this time but I'll talk about this in the last section of my post. Great gains were made and I even made some recomp improvements seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/74AOxw2). I weigh roughly 145 lbs/66 kg in both pictures and they're 2 months apart. In total I was training 6 times a week, lifting four times and doing cardio twice.\n\nSide note: in hindsight I don't recommend my style of deadlifting heavy twice a week if you're not eating a ton (I was following 5/3/1 for deadlifts and progressing every session - so I'd do 2 weeks worth of progression in one week) - my lower back still isn't back to normal. Whelp.\n\n# Results & what's next\n\nAll in all, even though I'm not strong yet and my lifting progress is somewhat mediocre, I hit 'intermediate' for all lifts within 1 year of lifting on Symmetric Strength save for my bench - which I'm okay with given my injury. I recently also completed a Tough Mudder (full distance, 11 miles) with zero problems and a year ago that would have seemed as unachievable as climbing the Everest. Fuck cardio, but I'm glad I'm fit enough to be able to pull of something like that.\n\nI also cannot emphasize enough how amazing it feels to be moderately happy enough with how I look. I'm not at the bodyfat % that I'd like to be at one day but strength is my focus for the next while. My main goal is getting a 2 plate squat and a bench that doesn't suck complete ass. In terms of short term physical goals, just let me look like I lift please!\n\n# Current diet & routine\n\n**Diet**: currently I estimate I eat around 1800-1900 calories (sometimes more if I have a cheat meal which is still only about once a week) and I'm maintaining for now, slowly trying to up my calories while not gaining weight. My protein intake is the main thing I watch, aiming to get around 140 grams/day. What I eat is still pretty much the same as when I was losing weight, just bigger portions - and in general, I try to eat more healthy carbs around my workouts. I still eat lots of chicken breast, lean steak, turkey burgers/sausages and beef mince, and I go through a ton of low fat/high protein greek yoghurt.\n\n**Exercise**: In terms of lifting - I did 5/3/1 BBB for two weeks after the meet and then decided to bail the fuck out of that because I just wanted to lift 5 times a week with very high bench frequency. So I jumped on nSuns (5 day version) and I'm enjoying it massively so far. Like I mentioned I'm still having some lower back issues so I've had to skip squats and deadlifts for the last 2.5 weeks, replacing them with rehab work. Still lifting 5 times/week though. I do a lot of pulling to balance all the nSuns pushing and put in a lot of vanity work to try and put on more muscle. Happy to write out what I do exactly in the comments if anyone wants the details.\n\nFor other exercise, I'm still doing cardio twice a week - I actually enjoy the stairmaster in a twisted way and I also like HIIT on stationary bikes. I do one cardio session on one of my days off, and one on an upper body day (usually the OHP/incline bench day - lift in afternoon, cardio in evening), training a total of 7 times/week.\n\n# Lastly: the mental aspects of weight loss\n\n**By far the hardest part of this journey** has been the mental aspect and I hope some people will be able to relate. Things I struggled with included, but weren't limited to: finding it hard to not be completely obsessed by numbers on the scale and/or bar; finding it very hard to let go of eating little (this was the hardest of all, and still is), and deciding between becoming stronger now (by eating more) or giving up good strength progress to get the body I want (by continuing to cut). I've also struggled at times to accept that I want to be swole rather than skinny - sometimes I realize I'm getting less conventionally attractive to some people and occasionally this worries me but usually I'm good at ignoring that and doing whatever makes \\*me\\* happy. In the end, you just have to learn to let go of thoughts that objectively don't make sense for you and your goals - such as not wanting to eat more.\n\n**On attitude**: in the end, your thoughts control who you are and what your habits become. I distinctly recall thinking halfway through my weight loss journey: \"I hope I'm one of those people that actually end up looking really fit after their weight loss and stick with it\", and shortly after realized that it's insane to think of this as if it's determined by an external set of factors. Only you control how you end up and nothing else. All habits you can build and become used to.\n\nOne year ago, if someone would have offered me the choice between $500 then, or $10,000 if I'd manage to lose 40 lbs within a year, I would have taken the $500 hands down - not for the money, but because I never ever believed that I could become a fit person with really healthy habits. Yet if you start with simple habits and focus on sticking to them consistently, it's crazy what you can build up to over time. I know people who make progress posts say this all the time, but it really is true\u2026 If I can do it, so can you.\n\n\\---\n\n**So there you have it!** Apologies for the absolute novel and happy to answer any questions because I have a lot more to say on this topic - just don't want this post to get any #@!!# longer :)", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "25/F/5'8, 55 lbs or 25 kg lost: one year on the powerlifting gains train, from obese to fit", "post_ups": 6017, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/92u04y/25f58_55_lbs_or_25_kg_lost_one_year_on_the/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:08.475838", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Titty_Patrol", "post_created_utc": 1480980443.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1481002963.0, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "5gpc6l", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 662, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 5972, "post_selftext": "24 yr old.

I tried to avoid any kind of physical activities since I wasn't good at any sports nor interested.\n\n\nRight before I finished high school, one of my friends asked me if I wanted to go to a gym with him and I just went without knowing what to expect. My first day at the gym was horrible. I remember using two 35lbs dumbbells to do a flat bench dumbbell press and thinking I was going to pass out after the 3rd rep. Since then, I've always been in and out of the gym. I did the typical bro split (chest/tris, back/bis, and etc). I didn't know what I was doing but since I was somewhat consistent, I didn't look \"fat\" anymore. Fast forward to summer of 2014, my clinical depression (got diagnosed way back in the day so I've had it pretty much my whole life) hit me harder than usual and I just dropped everything. I flunked all my classes, ate whatever &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;whenever and  slept when I wasn't eating. Fast forward to December 2014, I went to my mom's house for Christmas dinner and decided to weigh myself to find out that I gained 35lbs in span of 5 months(and I wasn't working out at all during that time so I'm assuming it was 35lbs + how much ever muscle mass I lost).\n\n\n\nI decided that enough was enough and started dieting again on New Years. For diet, I carb cycles which worked really well with my carb cravings and 3 day split that I was running. I didn't really count my calories since I was tracking my macros instead but it usually went like this.\n\nMy macros were:\nDay1(rest) 50c/30f/200p (1250-1300kcal)\nDay2(push) 150c/30f/200p (1800-1950kcal)\nDay3(pull) 150c/30f/200p (1800-1950 kcal)\nDay4(legs) 300c/60f/200p (2200kcal)\n\nEvery 8th day of my high carb day, I had a \"cheat meal\" but tried to stay on healthier side instead of binging on calorie condensed food (deep fried, sweets, and etc. but I did treat myself to milkshakes from time to time). I didn't really do any cardio during my cut just because I was lazy.\n\nRoutine:https://www.jefit.com/routines/workout-routine-database.php?id=22104\n\n\nI ran this for a while but also took time away from dieting when I was on vacation and enjoying summer. From fall of 2015 until August of 2016, I fluctuated back and forth between 185-195. In September, I was sitting at 185, not happy with how much mass I had I decided to \"mini-bulk\" up to 195 before cutting again. I'm not sure if that bulk did much at all but I started my cut again in October same carb cycling but upping my fat to 60 per day while dropping my protein according to my body weight.\n\nRoutine now: https://bodymaxing.com/2016/09/15/dltbb-routine/\n\nI'm sitting at 179-180lbs right now hoping to cut maybe 5lbs before I reverse diet or maintain. But I'm pretty happy with my result so far. It took me longer than some people's transformation, but I enjoyed myself when I wanted to and made it work with on my own time. Someone once told me, \"your fitness journey is not a sprint, but a marathon. So as long as you stay consistent and never give up. You'll get to your destination.\" And it really helped me out a lot when I was in doubt or feeling down with how I looked.\n\nThank you for reading and again, sorry about the format and grammar.\n\nEdit: whoa, thank you all for compliments, advices and just responding in general.

Pretty big eye opener that made me want to hit the gym. I thought at first it would be nearly impossible, but my buddies gave me a hand and were my gym partners from that day on.

I will provide one soon. \n\n**Edit 2**: Sorry work got a little busy, anyways. \n\nFirst and foremost I ordered this [weight gainer](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/opt/whey.html) to help me gain some mass. To my embarrassment, yes the picture on the left was weighing at approximately 100 lbs. That was during the time I just ate once or twice a day. I changed that eating lifestyle to eating at least 4 time a day with two protein shakes, one in the morning and one before bed. I also took some preworkout (Jack3d, C4) to give me that boost of energy necessary to rep some weights.\n\nAs far as for workouts and reps, my buddies were my trainers. So I will try my best as to what exactly they made me do each day.

Later that night, as I lay on my bed covered in a greasy sauce from the pound of Buffalo Chicken Cheese Fries I had just devoured, I took one last sip of my Green Tea Arizona and decided it was time for a change. I climbed down from my bunk bed and had my roommate take pictures of my sulking ass. The rest is history. \nWhen I posted that progress picture to instagram, I got a flood of questions from my friends asking how they can do the same. Instead of answering the same question 100 times, I made a google drive folder with all the info they'd ever need: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Y8MmU9NVxdFgeKU5cB-oM8TVUgnESCh4\n\n**PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE MY POST FOR LACK OF INFORMATION, THE DRIVE HAS IT ALL**\n\nThis includes my **diet plan, my routines**, and a quick rundown of my 2 year journey and what I learned about bodybuilding. Take note, I'm a very straightforward, no bs type of guy, so what I wrote in that 13 page manuscript is a hard, honest opinion on what I believe is necessary to seriously pursue bodybuilding. If you want to know how to truly start bodybuilding without wasting time sifting through Bro-Science, it's all in my \"How To Get Swole\" document. I also have a potty mouth, but that's something you're gonna have to deal with.\n\nWith that being said: I was 18 years old and started at 121 lbs, 19% body fat. I only gained about 20lbs of lean body mass, which goes to show how much of a trial-and-error process this has been. I was in a weird grey area of body composition, being skinny fat. I was weak and fat, so I didn't know whether to bulk or cut first. I tried cutting first and that was a huge mistake. I then decided to bulk and focus on strength gains, and everything took off from there. \n\nI started with Strong Lifts, going from benching the bar for 5x5 to benching a plate for 5x5. I did this for about a year until I could squat and deadlift 2 plates for 5x5. \n\nMy second year of training, I started incorporating accessory lifts. I made a Push Pull Leg style routine, putting shoulders on my leg day due to excessive fatigue on my push days. I did 2 days on one day off. I made the mistake of dirty bulking my first year, so I decided to start cutting. I counted calories and macros, and got to about 13% body fat before I gave up and blew right back up to 16%. I finally decided to start a serious cut, getting down to about 11% which took 5 months of strict dieting. \n\nNow that I'm as lean as I've ever been, I plan on starting my very first lean bulk in preparation for my first bodybuilding competition. I have about a year and a half to train, so I plan to bulk until January 3rd, allowing myself about 16 weeks to cut before my show. I'm going to focus entirely on hypertrophy training.

It was a hell of a rollercoaster.\n\nIn May 2015, I had enough. I was feeling sick, I was 24 and supposed to be in my prime. But at 340 pounds and 5\u201911\u2019\u2019, it was not the case.\nSo I decided to change. I went on the subreddit r/loseit and learned how to lose weight by counting your calories.\nAnd it worked.\n\nIn the first week I lost 17 pounds. Sure, a lot of it was water but God did it give me motivation to continue. The second week, I was 10 pounds lighter. It really worked. \n\nSo I counted my calories until I was around 215 pounds. By then, I had lost 125 pounds in around 7 months.\n\nWhile I was doing this, I decided to do the C25K (r/C25K) to help me start running. I ran my first 5K while I was weighing 275 pounds. It was slow, so very slow, but I did it. I was SO proud of myself. I was working on becoming a healthier person.\nThat\u2019s when I saw one of my childhood friend who is a gym rat. He was so proud of me and asked me if I was going to the gym. I was, but I did not follow any program. I was still doing some \u201cFuckArountIt\u201d, meaning I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. So he helped me to do a basic program.\n\n3 Days Split PPL\nLEGS\nCardio 20 minutes\nSquat 4 x 8\nLying Leg Curl 4 x 8\nStiff-Legged Deadlift 4x8\nRussian Step-up 4x8\nOne Leg Squat 4x8\nCalf Raise 4x8\nCardio 20 minutes\nPUSH\nCardio 20 minutes\nFlat Bench 4x6\nSeated Cable Row 4x8\nLat Pulldown 4x8\nIncline Dumbell Bench Press 4x8\nDumbell Row 4x8\nFlat Fly 4x8\nCardio 20 minutes\nPULL\nCardio 20 minutes\nDeadlift 5x6\nOHP 5x8\nShrug 4x8\nBarbell Row 4x10\nGlute-Ham raise 4x8\nCardio 20 minutes\n\n\nWith this new program in the gym, I then started to follow something like LeanGains (r/leangains) in counting my macros.\nTraining days 1800 Calories High Protein, High Carbs, Low Fat.\nRest Day 1500 Calories High Protein, Low Carbs High Fat.\n\n\nAnd I continued to shed some fat. It was slower, of course but progress kept on going. I stopped after 11 months at 172 pounds lost. I was weighing 168 pounds and was pretty skinny.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/c4BEQyK.jpg\n\n\nAt this point, I started going to maintenance a bit, around 2200/2400 calories. It was summer so I went in vacation, had fun and enjoyed my new shape. I even did a 21k for fun with a friend.\n\n\nSo, here we are. 168 pounds, able to run 21k, going to the gym 3 to 4 time a week. Eating 2200 calories a day. What was I going to do now?\n\n\nIt\u2019s Bulk time.

I just made it yesterday so I haven't posted anything yet. \n\nReposted link\n\nHere is my summary to meet Rule 2 of r/Fitness:\n\n**TL;DR/Top Ten Changes I've Personally Made From These Lessons:**\n\nThere's a million bits of info in these notes, but here's some ten takeaways I was able to implement over the course of two months.\n\n1. **Carbs:** Carbs are not the enemy, but need to be heavily regulated and based on individual performance, digestive health, and body-fat. Ethnic background is a huge factor. That being said, Charles states \"you need to earn your carbs,\" while Stan is more lenient, but still recommends you keep them low if you're not an elite athlete. If you do choose to eat carbs, white rice is the best carb as it doesn't cause inflammation or digestive issues like potatoes and brown rice can.\n2. **Sleep:** The greatest anabolic, absolutely necessary. The elite performers sleep 10-12 hours a day, including long naps during the day. Important to muscle growth, fat loss, and hormone regulation. I dim the lights 2 hours before bed, do my best to not check my phone, tv, or any electronic screen to improve sleep quality. \n3. **Programming:** I've split my workouts with 72-hours between muscle groups. Using a variety of exercises helps overall performance by choosing accessory work that addresses weaknesses. \"Exercise rotation and having a big exercise library prevents injury while allowing constant key movements.\" Only 4 main heavy days, with the other days as options for accessory or cardio.\n4. **Food choice:** Grass-fed meat research isn't proven yet, and doesn't justify the price. Eat quality cuts of beef, bison, and wild game. \"Otherwise, the best diet is the one you stick to.\" Just eliminated processed foods and snacks, and choose vegetables and fruits that the body will digest easily ([FodMap](https://www.ibsdiets.org/fodmap-diet/fodmap-food-list/)). Bought a sous-vide to prepare the Costco Steak, and a rice maker for the white rice. On it for two months and am seeing great results. Personally, I've added lots of berries, avocadoes, baby carrots, nuts, coconut oil, chia seeds to my daily diet. I also add kimchi and guacamole to some meals in order to keep the steak from being too routine. Also drinking 3oz of OJ multiple times a day.\n5. **Warm-Up:** Stretching is apparently a waste of time, and cardio before your lift will cause you to be insulin resistant, preventing fat loss. Either do potentiation exercises, or follow this advice: \"brain should know the range of motion, and weights should get heavier.\" Regarding potentiation: find where the weakest links are in the main lift, then pick a moderately light weight, and choose exercises that affect different muscle groups involved in the main lift. For example, the squat might be upper back (a), lower back (b), then hamstrings (c). Doesn't need to be heavy, just consistently volume with minimal rest. 4x25 with no rest: a, b,c, repeat 4 times total. Then rest 3-5 minutes, then you're ready attack the main lift (be if your heavy max or speed work). Matt noticed clients were getting stronger, and form was getting better over time. Matt started off light, but now can do 4x25's of 100lb dumbells on chest warmups. Work your way up.\n6.  **Walking:** Not just for old people: Ten minute walk, after you eat a meal. Improves digestion, decreases DOMS, helps with insulin sensitivity. \"Blood is the life force, brings in all the nutrients.\" Brisk walks with elevated heart outperforms leisure 10k step-walks in fat, heart, cardio benefits. Recommended is 3 ten-minute walks a day. Can replace all steady-state cardio with walks and HIIT. Recommended them to the women in competition and strongmen like the Mountain, both of whom saw fantastic results.\n7. **Cardio:** Implemented rucks over distance running, along with adding swimming, cycling, and farmers carries. Long slow-distance work inhibits muscle growth *and* fat-loss. That said, some cardio is required, hence the HIIT, farmers walks, etc as they are recommended. Still learning to program into the workout regimen.\n8. **Build the Backside:** If the muscle is behind you, chances are you need to build it stronger. The average person will have weak lower and upper back, hamstrings, glutes, calves, traps, rear delts, etc. Build those up by making them a priority in your accessory exercise selection. For example: Upperback not strong enough will change scapular position on bench press.\n9. **Salt:** Upped the intake of my salt. Iodized salt, stimulates thyroid, immune system, stimulates the liver. When you hit a wall, it's because you're low on sodium, not carbs. Guaranteed. Single biggest thing you can do to impact performance, stamina and endurance at the gym is iodized sodium.\n10. **Post-workout drink:**  Body super-compensates after a workout, so you need immediate replenishment, especially for two-a-days. Fructose (Orange juice) for liver stimulation, dextrose (scoop off Amazon) for glycogen replenishment, sodium (600mg), 100mg of caffeine (accelerates all of that). No proteins or fats immediately as it slows absorption.

Enjoy. \n\n\n\nDIET: Year 1: Atkins diet (low carb). All I did was track how many carbs I would eat, aimed to stay below 40g a day. lost 80lbs this way.\nYear 2: Starvation. ate 0-500cals a day. lost about 40lbs this way In a few months. hated it. don't do it haha. \nYear 2.5/Current: Macros. 2k cals, 200g protein 200g carbs, 45g fats. LOVE THIS! Not only do I get to eat all types of food, I eat for fuel! nothing I eat goes to waste... if I don't workout that day, I don't eat as much. I recommend doing this due to how you don't hate life on this diet. \n\nGym: Mondays back. Tuesday chest. Wednesday legs. Thursday shoulders. Friday arms. I have a slideshow that entails what I do on each of these days, that I have shared with a lot of friends and family. feel free to take a look, very simple to understand. great for beginners imo.

I ate like a dumpster with a mouth and didn't exercise outside of my sometimes-physical job. So I decided combine a daily run with a low-carb, high fat diet to lose weight and get healthier. Unfortunately I didn't weigh myself before, but I did take pictures on the day I decided to do all this: \n\n**Front Comparison Pic** http://imgur.com/LIcuWcX\n**Side Comparison Pic** http://imgur.com/wu9IUB0\n\nAs of today I weigh 170lbs. If I had to guess, I'd say I weighed somewhere between 190-210lbs back in January. \n\n**Diet**\nConsisted of low-carb, high fat food with the intention to keep my carb intake below 50g a day (usually I only hit 30g). I ate a lot of meat, salads, low sugar Greek yogurt, and wraps made with low-carb tortillas. I had done a diet like this before and have basically stuck with those three meals for the last three months. I did have a few cheat days here and there, but made sure to run on those days too. \n\n**Exercise**\nI have a NordicTrack treadmill that peaks at 12mph and, I think, 12% incline. I exclusively used the Aerobic Fitness presets which ranged from a max of 6.5mph and 10 percent incline. My usual walk/run is a 30 minute program that peaks at 4mph and 10% incline which comes out to around 1.7 miles. I do that twice, so I have been running 3 miles or more a day since January 6th. Sometimes I get a little crazy and go for the 6.5mph max preset, which makes me feel completely wiped out for the rest of the day. That one is 2.4 miles and I hope to eventually do two of those each morning without feeling it as hard. \n\n**Observations**\nSo besides the obvious one of my formerly-enormous gut shrinking, I have insane energy and endurance now compared to back in January. I look forward to running and I feel great at work afterwords (unless I do that dreaded 6.5mph max preset).

The first and second pictures are roughly 6 months apart, and the last two pictures are about a month and a half apart.\n\nIn the first picture, I was entirely focused on strength gains and putting up bigger numbers in the bench, squat and deadlift. After ballooning up too much, I decided it was time to lose some weight.\n\n**Diet**\n\nI decided that I would try a ketogenic style diet for my cut. I say \"style\" because I didn't really care much about being \"in ketosis\" - I quickly discovered that simply by eating fat and avoiding carbs I was much more satiated and able to stay out of the kitchen and snacking throughout the day. I also kept my protein intake at 1g per lb of bodyweight, which according to the keto bible will knock you out of ketosis. The protein intake didn't seem to affect me too greatly.\n\nI ate 3 meals per day, and tried my best to stick to the eating hours of 12pm-6pm, though this didn't always happen.\n\nAs this was a low carb diet, I ate plenty of fatty foods. Breakfast would be something like this:\n\n3 eggs\n\n4 slices of bacon\n\n1 oz cheddar\n\nAvocado\n\nLunch:\n\n8 oz ground beef\n\n1 oz cheese\n\nServing of veggies\n\nDinner was similar to lunch.\n\nFor snacks, I drank protein shakes to fill in my protein requirements and ate quest bars for the fiber and protein as well. Occasionally I would have some full fat Greek yogurt (Fage brand is relatively low in carbs) or whole milk (Fairlife Milk is relatively low in carbs).\n\nThis all added up to somewhere between 1900-2100 calories daily.\n\n**Exercise**\n\nDuring this whole cut I followed [nsuns 531 5-day variation.](http://archive.is/2017.01.27-015129/https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5icyza/2_suns531lp_tdee_calculator_and_other_items_all/)\n\nDespite losing weight, I did gain some decent strength in the deadlift and squat using this program, though my bench/OHP didn't increase quite as much. My numbers went from:\n\nSquat: 340 lbs > 370 lbs\n\nBench: 230 lbs > 240 lbs\n\nDeadlift: 385 lbs > 440 lbs\n\nOHP: 145 lbs > 155 lbs\n\nFor the first 6 months (from first to second pic) I did absolutely no cardio. For the past month and a half, in hopes of losing the final 5 lbs to get to 170, I've been incorporating 3-4 days of steady state cardio for ~20 minute sessions. On off days I will also do some kind of circuit training with light weights.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the keto style diet, although I acknowledge the most important factor is achieving a caloric deficit. For my eating preferences, I was able to achieve a sustainable deficit by eating fatty foods and feeling satiated, and that's enough for me. I don't believe keto is \"magical\" or superior to a traditional style diet, but it certainly worked well for me. If you're curious about the diet, check out /r/keto and /r/ketogains - they were great resources for me along the way.\n\nTL;DR: Keto style diet + powerlifting style training = better physique\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nEdit: I guess it is also important that I mention in the first picture, I had been training consistently for over a year, and I had a decent strength base. **My muscle gains did not all come in the last 7 months**. I don't wish to be misleading. \n\nEdit 2: Apparently the nsuns link isn't working for some so [here's](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8EbfzFB0mBrSjBFZ1NUUklHU1E/view) a link to the spreadsheet.\n\nEdit 3: Alright since I'm getting a lot of questions, let me give you guys some important info regarding my abs. No, I do not train abs directly, but that does **not** mean that you can necessarily get abs without training them directly. Ever since I was 12 years old, I was obsessed with the idea of a 6 pack, and would do ab exercises almost every day throughout my teen years. I had a horrible physique, but was convinced getting a six pack was the answer - it wasn't. [Even when I was skinny fat, I had some abs under there](http://imgur.com/a/4ZeFM) (this pic is about 4 years old). I don't train abs because I had already developed them as a teen, and heavy compound lifting is enough to maintain them. Going on a huge cut and losing 30 lbs is not going to give you abs if you don't already have them!

I was 10 when I was first called fat in school and ever since that day I've been the fattest kid in the class. I sweat a lot and being born and raised in Tunisia didn't help with the high temperatures around the year. So yea basically every day in school was a shamefest. Which only worsened the issue because it made me get to hate going out and hence a vicious cycle of eating and staying home playing video-games/watching movies kicked in.   \n\nAlthough I always had in me a strong urge, a want to practice physical activity. I wanted to run, play soccer and whatever but my body always hindered me. At some point I gave up dieting and such because I was convinced something is definitely wrong with me. \n\nA few years ago, I moved to Paris, France for professional reasons. I got a gym membership. I used it for a couple of months and that was that. Fast forward to August 2016, I was walking home with a friend of mine and we agreed to get our shit together and start working out consistently. Mind you at some point before this conversation I weighed around 120+kg for 167cm (264lbs for 5'5\"). I was convinced I had to do something and a lot of factors that I won't bore you with played in making me just get my game on.\n\nThis is me on [December 2015](https://imgur.com/a/Gnkap)   \nThis is me in [May 2016](https://imgur.com/a/6hIK4), approximate weight 100kg (?).\n\n\nAugust 2016, started at 98kg, August 31st I weighed 90kg. Cycling in the gym and doing whatever I can to eat less (must've been eating around 1400 calories/day but I didn't know about MFP back then). I wanted so bad to run on treadmill but I couldn't because of shin splints. For the life of me I wouldn't be able to run past the 1km marker without feeling intense pain in my forelegs. \n\nSeptember 2016-February 2017: Continued to shed weight fast, 4kg/month on average. All by doing intense, long cardio sessions (Some sessions were 1600 calories worth) and watching my food. At that point I had joined MyFitnessPal and started to try get my calorie count right. [February 7th 2017](https://imgur.com/a/Xs6u0) , I weighed 74.5kg my scale estimates my BF to be around 20% \nwhich is highly inaccurate imo. This period though was a huge success for me. I had successfully ran 15km for the first time ever in 85ish minutes. And got my 10k to 49 minutes. This period of time was cardio only almost, I just wanted to become a runner like I always wished I could be. \n\nMarch 2017: Started at 70.5kg still shedding weight fast, my scale estimates my BF ~17-18%. I wore a size S shirt for the first time of my life. And still looked nothing like I hoped I'd look [like](https://imgur.com/a/WxHT2). I was still counting calories at a deficit and a steep one too. But at this point I was already proud of what I have achieved, and I started to believe my body transformation is actually possible :D  \n\nMay 2017: This was a major turning point. I ditched my old workout regime that made no sense. And browsed the wiki here for a program I can run that can actually help me recomp. And stumbled upon the PHUL program. I never touched a dumbbell before in my life.  Going to the free weight area in my gym alone was a MAJOR step. At this point I weighed [65kg](https://imgur.com/a/C3aDS).  \n I already had visible abs. Scale BF estimate was around 15%. I hit the gym 5 days a week, 4 days during the working week around 6AM because basically I was a noob and didn't wanna shame myself during rush hour lol. I benched, squatted and deadlifted and it never felt any better.  \n\n\nSeptember 2017: [End of my cut](https://imgur.com/ztXAk2D) September 18th at 64kg and 13% BF, at this point I was feeling too weak in the gym. Struggling to keep my numbers and failing most of the time. I started to hate the experience of squatting or benching. I was not happy with the result I have hoped to remove some more fat, but you gotta listen to your body. \nAt this point I was really frustrated but recomp is one hell of a challenge, the loose skin effect is doubled with a layer of fat that wouldn't leave the belt area. But I was reasonable enough to retreat and fight another day. After this I maintained for 2 weeks, and 2 weeks ago I started a lean bulk phase. Planning to make it a short one then go back to cutting alternating for 2 weeks.   \nI am still experimenting with both programming and diet plans, starting to feel the need for coaching but I made it so far on my own I might as well just keep at it and have fun doing it.   \n\nSo there you go guys, I tried to keep it as short as possible if you have any questions just hit me up i'm more than glad to answer.   \nAnd last this MFP account my diary is public: http://www.myfitnesspal.com/profile/yondaime8 feel free to add me. \n\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "14 month transformation.

I\u2019ve been at the gym consistently for about 3 months and have made [decent gains that I would like to keep](https://imgur.com/a/gK4wNdm). \n\nUnlike me, my parents are not very health conscious at all, and even though they\u2019re technically \u201cobese\u201d (on a BMI scale) they\u2019ve ignored doctor\u2019s warnings about their risk of developing  adverse heart conditions. They\u2019re actively against taking action about their health even though they read health articles everyday and feel educated on the topics. \n\nOn top of this: all of my aunts on my dad\u2019s side are obese and have eating disorders. My mom\u2019s side seems to be a bit better but not by much. My uncles on both sides are quickly becoming obese. \n\nMy sisters are younger than I am (I\u2019m 18) and are quickly gaining weight (and it\u2019s showing) because of their irresponsible eating habits. They consume junk non-stop and eat until they\u2019re full every time they sit down to eat. \n\nOverall, the cards aren\u2019t really stacked in my favor. \n\nLast night, (its been one day since I arrived home), we were eating at the dinner table and I brought up the idea of going to the gym or at least signing up. The nearest gym is a ways away and cost $45/mo. I do have the money, but it\u2019s to be spent on books for the upcoming school year. \n\nAsking about signing up was a mistake. A cascade of bogus health advice and assessments of my body ensued (they think I\u2019m anorexic). \n\nI was fuming for a bit after, but in the middle of the night I started trying to make some weight with some of the left over sand that we had in the garage.\n\n^TL;DR^ Parents don\u2019t like that I want to go to the gym so they won\u2019t let me go.

I made big changes over the next two to three years which were spurred mainly by rugby and weightlifting, and as you all know learning to control my diet. I lost over 100lbs and gained a bit of muscle over a 2-3 year period, but most of the progress was made in the final year, between the ages of 17-18. Here are the results from the initial weightloss.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8qBWXXI.jpg\n\nUnfortunately near the end of 2013, after finally reclaiming my body, I fell severely ill with pneumonia. On christmas day I was rushed to hospital after a large hole formed in my right lung. I was hopped onto morphine for two days, of which I remember nothing. I was put in an induced coma, and was in intensive care for 60 days, 30ish of which were in the coma. This time last year my mother was planning my funeral. It was very touch and go due to organ failure while on life support. \n\nWhen I woke from the coma I was too weak to move my legs or raise my arms. For three months I didn't eat or drink. For two months I couldn't talk (due to having a tracheostomy with breathing support). It was hell incarnate, a true experience of suffering and pain. I was incredibly angry throughout the experience. Why the fuck did this happen? Why do I have to lose everything? One resounding thing which was constantly on my mind throughout was, \"I'm going to murder the gym when I get out\".\n\n I had to gradually start walking again, getting motor skills back etc. When I got out of hospital simple things like putting on shoes and walking to the fridge exhausted me. I bought a 2kg weight and starting doing curls, but could only manage a few reps. I went to physical rehab regularly, but I bailed out halfway through and started my gym membership again. I did a four day split focusing on compound movements, and ate at a 500kcal surplus. I packed on strength and size, and put on 40kg over the course of this year. Over the last two months I have cut 10kg in order to lean down for summer. (achieving this with a simple 500kcal deficit). \n\nMy results are not perfect. i had a lot of issues this year, I shattered my hand at the peak of my bulk due to poor bone density following the coma. I didn't take time off the gym, I just got a strap to clip my cast to the cable machine and did a modified full body workout. I do not advocate this for anyone else, but I was willing to risk it. I also had really bad knee pain from the 4~ months of bedrest, which has made it very difficult to squat and do any running or walking based cardio. \n\nI cant compare stats from hospital, as I couldn't move my arms so I'm assuming I was a lightweight. Here are my stats now\n\nsquat: 140kg 1rm\ndeadlift: 150kg 1rm\nbench: 5 reps of 85 (I have never tested max)\nstrict press: 60kg 1rm\n\nI'm not sure if I've provided enough detail, so feel free to ask questions. I also apologize in advance for any formatting issues, this is my first post. \n\nMy message to you all: Before the coma, I was extremely fit. My lungs and body were strong, I had weight to waste away. If I had still been obese with a shitty diet I would be dead. If I hadn't taken cardio so seriously i would be dead. If my body hadn't been strong, I would be dead. The doctors said it was a miracle I survived, and if it really was that close, all those factors related to fitness would definitely have pushed me over that threshold which made me survive.

One that claims that you can\u2019t focus on specific parts of your chest (eg. Upper chest, lower chest, etc), while the other claims that you can.  I am split between the two. You can't completely isolate the upper chest. When you do an incline bench press, your entire chest will be activated.  But I believe that to build muscle, you have to consciously contract the muscle that you are working (known as the mind-muscle connection). Pumping out a bunch of reps on incline bench press might not target your upper chest the way you want it to. But if you perform the incline bench press in a controlled manner, and focus on really contracting/squeezing the top of your chest, you will see a difference. A trick that you can use to learn how to squeeze the muscle is to close your eyes during the set, and visualize exactly what you want your chest to do. Intent is needed to optimally stimulate growth. \n\n>**BARBELLS OR DUMBBELLS?**\n\n>Both barbells and dumbbells have their pros and cons.  In general, I have found that barbells are superior for developing overall strength in your pressing, and dumbbells are superior for stimulating growth in your chest.\nThe reason why I prefer dumbbells for growth is because they allow you to go through a greater range of motion than barbells. With dumbbells, you can have your arms wide at the bottom of the movement to fully stretch your chest, and then have your hand close together at the top to fully contract your chest.  With a barbell, you hands are in a fixed location during the entire movement.  It\u2019s much easier to consciously contract the muscle you\u2019re intending to work with dumbbells, and they have actually been shown to reduce triceps involvement when compared to barbell pressing movements (http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02640414.2010.543916#.VQhvpoHF9XY).  \n\n>A great trick you can use to make dumbbell movements even more effective for your chest is to [pronate your arms](http://groundupstrength.wdfiles.com/local--files/training%3Ahook-grip-versus-alternated-grip-for-deadlifts/forearm-supination-pronation-hand.jpg).  The reason why I do this relates back to the anatomy of the pec major.  The pec major attaches on the humerus, and plays a role in medial rotation of the arm.  Pronating your arm is a great cue to initiate medial rotation of the upper arm.  This allows the chest to be maximally contracted.  This can be seen [here](https://instagram.com/p/0X8azDyDok/).  Notice at the bottom of the lift, the hands move in a supinating motion, and then at the top, the hands pronate. This allows you to stretch your pecs at the bottom of the movement, and then fully contract at the top.\n\n>Barbells are great for developing overall strength in your pressing muscles.  When using a barbell, you are can lift more weight, and you are stimulating your triceps and deltoids to a high level, rather than just your chest.  Both of these factors lead to an increase in strength. \n\n>A good chest routine for aesthetic/bodybuilding purposes will include both barbell and dumbbell work.  I would recommend 3-4 movements for your chest, while including incline, flat, and decline work.\n\n>**UPPER CHEST TRAINING**\n\n>The upper chest is usually the part of the chest that most people are lacking.  The easiest way to target this part of the chest is to train on an incline.  Now, keep in mind that the larger the angle of the incline the more the deltoids will be brought into the movement.  I find that the angle that allows to me to hit my upper chest in the best way is around 40 degrees.  Once I start getting higher than that, I feel fatigue in my deltoids before I feel it in my chest. \n\n>* Incline Dumbbell Bench Press\n\n>* Inline Barbell Bench Press\n\n>* Incline Dumbbell/Cable Flys\n\n>Incline dumbbell press is one of my favourite chest exercises. Dumbbells really allow you to work through the full range of motion, and let you squeeze your chest at the top of each movement.  A mistake that many people make while performing this exercise is hitting the dumbbells together at the top. This usually suggests that you\u2019re not maintaining control over the weight during the entire movement.  Instead, it is best to stop with about an inch between the dumbbells.  This allows for a good contraction while maintaining control of the movement. \n\n>Incline barbell bench press is also a great movement, but I am not too fond of it personally. I find that it places a lot of stress on my shoulders/rotator cuff. Many coaches suggest that it is not necessary to touch the bar to your chest for this exercise. It is best to stop about an inch or two above your chest, because going lower can place unnecessary stress on your rotator cuff.   \n\n>Flys are a great exercise. The same trick described under the dumbbell or barbell section with dumbbells can be applied to flys, whether they are on an incline, decline, flat bench, or a machine, This can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibqPdkt6MYk).  \n\n>**MIDDLE CHEST TRAINING**\n\n>This part of the chest is often associated with flat presses. But remember, to grow the middle of your chest, you cant just perform flat presses without thinking; focus on squeezing the middle of your chest while you press.\n\n>* Flat Dumbbell Bench Press\n\n>* Flat Barbell Bench Press\n\n>* Flat Dumbbell/Cable Flys\n\n>* Push Ups\n\n>* Chest Dips\n\n>Flat barbell bench press is a great exercise for chest development, and allows you to use heavier weights than you would with a dumbbell.  But unlike the incline barbell bench press, you should touch your chest while you perform this movement.  With proper form, going to your chest will not place too much stress on your shoulders.  A common technique used by some lifters is bench pressing with a [wide grip, and flaring their elbows out](http://imgur.com/V0FNK88).  Although this may be effective for chest development, I do not think that the risk it places your shoulders at is worth it.  This puts your shoulders at a very high risk of injury, especially with heavier weights.  Instead, I would recommend someone to bench press with their elbows slightly tucked in, like in the bottom of [this image](http://imgur.com/V0FNK88).  Make sure you don\u2019t tuck your elbows too far in, like in [this image](http://www.roypumphrey.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/0908-mma-close-grip-press-1.jpg).  \n\n>For the flat dumbbell bench press and flys, the same tips from upper chest apply.\n\n>Push-ups are great exercise for your chest, no matter what your experience is.  For advanced lifters, they could be a great way to finish of your chest workout, or can go great in a super set with a lift such as flys.  For a beginner, they are a great way to progress on to the bench press, and develop pressing strength before moving on to weights.\n\n>**LOWER CHEST TRAINING**\n\n>The lower chest is often the most neglected part of ones chest. \n\n>* Decline Dumbbell Bench Press\n\n>* Decline Barbell Bench Press\n\n>* Decline Dumbbell/Cable Flys\n\n>[Dorian Yates](http://www.fitnessandpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/dorian-yates-workout-routine-600x330.jpg)  has stated that he believes that the decline barbell bench press is the greatest chest movement for overall chest development.  Some studies have even shown that the decline bench press causes the most activation in the chest when compared to other exercise.  The decline bench press also places significantly less stress on your shoulders than the flat press would, and especially the incline bench press (the more of an incline you are at, the more shoulder involvement. The more of a decline you are at, the less shoulder involvement). Given all of this, I personally do not like the decline bench press because it feels awkward to me.  But if you don\u2019t mind it, I would 100% recommend for this to be a part of your routine.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* There is a dispute over whether you can isolate parts of the chest or not\n\n* You can't work only the upper chest for example, but using an incline and consciously focusing on contracting the upper chest will really benefit you.  \n\n* Dumbbells are great for muscle growth and barbells for strength development.\n\n* Incorporate both for an optimal routine\n\n* A cool trick with dumbbells or cables you can use is to pronate your hands at the top of the movement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Chest 101: An Anatomical Guide to Training", "post_ups": 5035, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2zh7ah/chest_101_an_anatomical_guide_to_training/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:08.475838", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "asolitaryecho", "post_created_utc": 1451793499.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1451831529.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "3z8bkm", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 151, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 5019, "post_selftext": "Hi r/fitness!

Many times along the way, I came into this sub (along with r/loseit and r/progresspics) for inspiration and motivation and I believe it helped me get through some of the harder days when I just wanted to give up.\n\nI still remember the day, I was watching my son in swimming lessons, looking at the gym in the same building and wondering if I could do it. I have been overweight most of my life and never thought I could really lose the weight. \nIt was April 2013 and I made a goal for myself the next day.  I was going to be 165lbs by the time I started Nursing School in September.  I downloaded MyFitnessPal and started counting calories. I worked 10 hours a day in a highly physical job but made myself go to the gym every night after work for at least an hour. I had one training session where they taught me to do a half hour of weights and a half hour of cardio. I stuck to this routine religiously and the weight just fell off. It was the middle of August 2013 when I got on the scale and it read 164lbs. I cried so hard that day. I had hit the goal I set for myself and was more confident than ever. I will never forget that day!\n\nFitness has turned into a passion for me now. Its part of my life. It got me through nursing school and many hard times in my life.  Many days after a long day at the hospital, I come to the gym to unwind and rejuvenate. The gym is my escape. I head to the gym when I am happy, sad or just bored. I cant picture my life without it now. I have gained great friends, immense knowledge and an appreciation for this body I live in that I never had before.  \nI have never stopped setting goals. When I hit one PR, I start working on the next. I believe that is the key to my success - constant goal setting and a thorough determination to be better than I was the day before. \n\nNow the good part - Pictures!!\nBefore: http://imgur.com/a/qNLSG\nAfter (Today): http://imgur.com/a/jTFnU\n\nThanks for reading! :)\n\n\nEdit: Diet is the most important key to my success, I believe. When I started I kept my calories around 1500/day. I exercised using weight machines and mostly elliptical, for an hour a day, at least 6 days a week. As the weight started coming off, I continued to count calories but changed my routine to a more endurance based program, with lower weights and higher reps. I then went to a 5x5 strength gaining program and started incorporating squats, deadlifts, etc. Thats where I really found my love. I have a true love for heavy lifting!!\nI basically have done a combination of all of those things for the last couple years. I change it up every couple of months to keep things interesting and make further progress.\nNow, I am counting macros. It is the best thing I have done, by far. It started as a challenge with a girlfriend to eat 100g carbs/60g fats/150g protein each day for 30 days. I also added a lot of cardio with weights type exercises and HIIT training to my regime. It worked wonders. I continued past the 30 days and lost a total of 8lbs in 45 days. It toned me up fantastically as well. The first 20 days of eating by those macros just about killed me but I am  so happy I did it and I continue to eat close to those macros today. I want to maintain the body I have now and maybe tone up a bit more. \n\nEdit#2: Thank you all for the lovely, kind words! I am absolutely overwhelmed by the response! Thank you all so much! I hope I can inspire even just one person to believe in themselves and do what has always seemed to just be a dream. \nI wanted to answer some questions this morning, but I came online to find the post locked and I am unable to comment directly to people :(. So I'll answer a bit here. \nYes I squat 225! I max out for squats at 235, bench at 140 and I can pull a 250 deadlift. :) I am super proud of those numbers!\nI absolutely have issues with excess skin and stretch marks. It is getting better everyday, and I credit the weightlifting for that. I did lose the weight suddenly at first, but the gradual toning up (thanks to weight lifting) over the last few years has helped to make the skin a little less saggy. I still have quite a bit of extra skin in the thigh area. Maybe one day it will look better than today, but I have gotten used to it.\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "My 2 year journey of becoming fit, healthy and happy.

I'm going to outline some things I've learned in the hope that it will help others.\n\nI have three big takeaways that I want to lay out.\n\n1\\) This progression shows what is possible when starting out as a skinny\\-fat desk worker in your late 30's. I have never had a muscular physique nor excelled in sports to any degree.\n\n2\\) Over the past few years exercising years I've gotten much stronger, and I have bulked and cut many many times. But whenever I cut, I was disappointed with the results. I simply became skinny, with little definition. But this last cut was different for a few reasons.\n\n* I switched to a body building routine\n* I paid extra attention to to abs and obliques\n* I counted protein religiously\n* I took the plunge and cut an extra 7 lbs lower than I normally do, even though this put me at seemingly low overall weight\n\n3\\) I got a surprising result. DEXA showed I was able to gain 4 lbs of lean to my \"lower trunk\" despite being on a drastic cut. I believe this was possible due to noob gains. This is odd since I have been power\\-lifting for many years. But only during my cut did I concentrate hard on exercises exclusively hitting abs and obliques. My theory is that you can experience noob gains in specific areas that are underdeveloped while cutting.\n\n**Quick Background**\n\nI've always been really skinny. I was 125 lbs in high school 5'11\". Working out daily and playing football didn't change that. \\(My buddies all packed on muscle, but I stayed super\\-thin\\) After high school I packed on weight, but it was all fat.\n\n[At 35 I was 170 lbs, very skinny fat.](https://imgur.com/bI9RGiP) I had bad wrists and a bad back.  I was probably well over 35&#37; BF, judging by future DEXA scans. But I still looked pretty \"thin\" in clothes.  I had a pot\\-belly.\n\n4 years ago I discovered keto on Reddit and gave it a shot. I lost a ton of weight going down to about 149 lbs. This was the first time I felt in control of my body. I lost lots of fat, but now I was really skinny and weak.\n\nI then started to exercise slowly, learning along the way.  I started with exercise bands, and a simple workout. \\(I was so weak!\\)\n\nI eventually got into power lifting and olympic lifting. I wasn't great at it, but I kept getting stronger.\n\n**Lifting Scores**\n\nMy lifting scores were really at the bottom. Starting lifting scores\n\n* DL **95** lbs\n* Squat **65** lbs\n* Bench **65** lbs\n\nOver the next few years I found routines, hit the gym 5\\-6 days a week and made progress. I cycled my bulks and cuts. I made mistakes along the way. Current lifting scores\n\n* DL **350** lbs \\(yay\\)\n* Squat **215** lbs \\(meh\\)\n* Bench **165** lbs \\(boo\\)\n\n\\(Dead lifting comes easy to me, which is great considering I used to have chronically bad wrists and lower back. That's all gone now, and I feel fantastic.\\)\n\nNote: I have relatively long arms. That probably helps my deadlift and hurts my bench.\n\n**Main mistakes over the years past**\n\n* I bulked too fast, causing me to have to cut too much.\n\nI chased the immediate power lifting scores at the expense of packing on fat. One time I bulked added 2.6lbs per week! I now aim for .6lbs per week.\n\n* I didn't count protein. Once I did, I realized I was deficient.\n\n\"I eat fine. I don't need to count macros. I don't want to live like a lab rabbit.\" I was wrong.  You should count macros at least once. This will give you a good audit of your diet. You'll be forced to make adjustments. Going forward you'll have a better intuitive idea of your macros and better habits.\n\n* I didn't stick to rigorous programs at first.\n\nMy worst progress was when I just went to the gym and \"worked out really hard\".  My best progress was when I decided on a program and stuck to it for many months.\n\n**This Last Cut**\n\nI was invited to a fun pirate party for a friends 50th birthday. I challenged myself to go semi\\-bare chested and show off a great physique. I knew of the event 6 months in advance, so I planned accordingly.\n\nSo far every time I very time I cut I just looked thin, with no definition.\n\nI had 4 DEXAs previously and doing the math I calculated that I needed to cut to nearly 135lbs! I never had the nerve to cut so low as it sounded ridiculous. But considering that I was 125 lbs in high school, maybe it makes some sense.\n\nI was very nervous of the outcome.\n\n**Results**\n\n[No one was more shocked than me at the results.](https://imgur.com/GAZyjAu)\n\nSeveral friends asked if I was wearing some sort of fake muscle shirt!\n\nAfter the photo \\(and party\\) I stopped cutting, I shot up nearly 5 lbs overnight. The abs remain but they are much less defined now. \\(The DEXA showing 13&#37; was taken 10 days after the party.\\)\n\n[This is what I looked like a few weeks later at 145 lbs](https://imgur.com/dbxwcwG)\n\n**Stats**\n\nWeight160lbs =\\> 138lbs \\(22lbs Lost\\)\n\nAge41 years old\n\nBF&#37; At final\n\nI used three methods\n\n* 13&#37; \\- DEXA \\(10 days after picture\\)\n* 7&#37;  \\- Calipers \\(5\\-point Jackson Pollock\\)\n* 10.45&#37; \\- Impedance Scale\n\n**DEXA Scan Results**\n\nMy cut was pretty drastic. I was worried that I'd lose muscle.\n\nI took a \"before\" DEXA. It was many months before I started the cut, but it's a pretty good comparison.\n\n**Previous DEXA to Final picture was**\n\n* 19.4&#37; =\\> 13&#37;\n* Lean 7.2lbs **GAINED**\n* Fat 10.0lbs **LOST**\n\n**Diet**\n\nDEXA scan says my RMR is 1500.\n\nMy cal/day started at 2,000 and tapered down to 1,000 cal / day towards the end.\n\nLooking at my daily log\n\nWeek 1: 2,000 cal per day\n\nWeek 2: 1,500 cal per day\n\nWeek 4: 1,300 cal per day\n\nWeek 6: 1,200 cal per day\n\nWeek 8 \\- 10: 900 cal per day \\(But If I'm honest I was not hitting that and averaging 1,025 cal per day\\)\n\nThis is pretty extreme so I started cutting out 200 calories a day over a week to ease into it.\n\n**Breakfast**\n\n* Coffee with 1 tbsp heavy cream\n\n**Lunch**\n\n* Low cal fish \\(Talapia, Mahi Mahi\\) \\(no oil\\)\n* 8oz brussle sprouts\n\n**Snack**\\(I'd usually eat my snack right before hitting the gym\\)\n\n* Protein bar or shake \\(Epic Chicken bar has 15g Protein and 100cals\\)\n* Alternates: Pork Rinds, Sardines in Water on Lettuce, Bone Broth, Greek Yogurt, 2 eggs\n\n**Dinner**\n\n* 8oz New York Steak\n* Alternates: Chicken, Turkey, Shrimp\n* Veggies\n\n**Alcohol**\n\n* No way, Jose. No cheating this time.\n\n**Exercise Routine**\n\nBefore this cut I have never done a bodybuilding routine. I have only done power lifting routines with accessories. Previous routine was nSuns AMRAP. I also ran Ben Pollack's Unf\\* your Program.\n\nThe nSuns had the biggest impact bringing my combined power lifting score from **538lbs** to **779lbs.**\n\nDuring the cut I did **Scott Herman's Bodybuilding Split**. Which is basically\n\n* Monday: Chest \\(Dumbell, cable flys, etc\\)\n* Tuesday: Back,Biceps, obliques \\(pull downs, curls, etc\\)\n* Wednesday Glutes,Quads,Traps \\(Squat, etc\\)\n* Thursday: Hamstrings Shoulders \\(Dead lift, Lat Raises, etc\\)\n* Friday: Abs and Obliques\n* Saturday: Rest\n* Sunday: Start Over\n\n**Cardio**\n\n* Moderate.\n* 20 minutes Stairmaster after a workout. Some light jogging for 20 minutes at a time.\n\n**A Note on Abs and Obliques**\n\nMy obliques got HUGE. DEXA literally says that I gained 4lbs of the total 7lbs in my lower trunk area \\(abs and obliques\\). I am positive that all of this happened during the cut and not before.\n\nA few thoughts. I think I was severely under trained in my obliques, thus I was able to experience the magical noob\\-gains in that area, while my other, more trained areas, stayed about the same.\n\n*Compound lifts alone did NOT work my abs and obliques enough.*\n\nI needed target exercises such as\n\n* Wood Choppers\n* Side Bends\n\n*They key seems to be to do these SLOW, controlled, with solid form, and really feel the obliques. Mentally isolate the oblique and try to only use that muscle for the exercise.*\n\n\\-\\-\n\nI hope that this encourages some older folks or skinny\\-fat folks to hang in there and stay the course. And remember kids, count your protein.\n\n\\-\\-\n\nEDIT\n\n**My Lifting Scores**\n\nI HAVE NOT been \"lifting for four years\". Four years ago I started to diet and get more healthy.\n\nThe first few years of my four\\-year journey consisted of light exercises, learning how to exercise.\n\nI didn't even know what a squat or deadlift was 2\\+ years ago.\n\nI started my first serious strength program \\(nSUNS AMRAP\\) 13 months ago.  I added 270lbs to my combined score within 6 months. As stated in the \"Mistakes\" section, I wasted time by not following a rigorous program.\n\nBeing a strongman powerlifter is NOT my goal.  I am not offering powerlifting advice or claiming to be good at it.\n\n**Frame\\-Size**\n\nI'm really small\\-framed. So please keep that in mind before applying anything I did to you.\n\nMy dad and brother are  6'4\" and naturally hover at 280lbs.  They have big hands and thick wrists. \\(My dad once dieting down to 210lbs and he was THIN.\\)\n\nMy brother told me that even if he doesn't workout for a few years he can walk into the gym rep 215lb on the bench with ease.\n\nMy wrists are 5.75\"! \\(I think that's considered small even for a woman.\\)\n\nI wear a size small shirt, have a 30\" waste, small wrists, small ankles, narrow feet.\n\nI naturally hover at about 160 lbs.\n\nMy DEXA shows my RMR at only 1500 cal/day. Most guys are naturally much larger and need more calories. I do not recommend my daily cal/day for others.\n\nAlso, this was a **temporary** cut over 10 weeks for a **specific date**. This is not a lifestyle, this is an experiment.\n\n\\-\\-\n\n**Bonus Photos**\n\n[In celebration of hitting 3.5k upvotes, here's a bonus pirate photo!](https://imgur.com/zVGeS0a) ARG!\n\nThat's a professional Johny Depp impersonator.

It summarizes my progress.\n\n---\n##Hi Reddit!\nI shared my progress pictures with my family and friends yesterday. I got nice comments that I thought to write about my fitness progress so far in more detail here.\n\n---\n##**Stats**\n\n---\n+ Height: 5'11\" / 180 cm\n\n\n* Age: 16\n\n\n* [**Progress pics**](http://imgur.com/a/6BzWC)\n\n\n* Starting weight: 125 lbs. / 57 kg\n\n\n* After weight: 152 lbs. / 69 kg\n\n---\n##**Initial motivation**\n\n---\nI always wanted to go to the gym. I was weak and quite underweight. I could only do a few pushups and only one proper pullup. I browsed /r/fitness and /r/bodybuilding a lot but never really got around to it. There was a gym in my town but it was quite expensive \u20ac38 per month without a free weight area.\n\n----\n##**Training**\n\n---\nI started off doing bodyweight training only. My town did not have any fitness parks to workout at. Instead I used different school playgrounds as my main workout area. As the exercises became easier I either added weight through a backpack full of boring school books or moved on to a harder progression which you can see below.\n\n\nExercise | Before | After |\n-------- | ------ | ----- |\nPullups\t| 1x\t| 3x7 +5kg (+12kg bw) |\nDips\t| 2x\t| 3x10 +8kg (+12kg bw) |\nRows\t| 3x4\t| 3x10 one arm incline rows |\nPushups\t| 3x5\t| 3x12 +20kg\t|\nSquats\t| 3x12\t| 3x8 +10kg single leg squats|\nLunges\t| 3x8\t| 5x20 +40kg |\nAbs\t| 30 sec plank\t| 3x10 hanging leg raises|\nSprints | 5x40m | 10x90m\t|\n\n######Basic Workout Breakdown:\n\n\nThis is a basic example of what my average workout looked like. Some days I'll sub in different exercises, but this will give you a good starting point. For example once I got to 15 reps on pushups for 3 sets I either added weight through a backpack or moved onto diamond pushups.\n\n\nWorkout A| Workout B| Workout C |\n--------- | --------- | --------- |\nPullups 3x5-10| Dips 4x5-10 | Wide Pullups 3x5-10\nDips 3x5-10| Chinups 4x5-10  | Dips 3x5-10\nRows 3x8-15| Weighted Pushups 4x5-10| Rows 5x8-15\nPushups 3x8-15| Pause Rows 4x5-10| Pushups 5x8-15\nSquats 3x15-20 | Leg Raises 4x10-15| Squat Jumps 3x5\nWalking Lunges 3x15-20 | Hill Sprints 50m x8| Lunges 5x15-20\n\n---\n##**Diet**\n\n---\nI usually eat whatever I want and I make sure to get enough calories and protein at the end of the day. But I know people on r/fitness always want the full package so below is an example of what my diet looks like on a school day.\n\n\nMeal | Example |Calories| Protein | \n--------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- | \nBreakfast | 3 Scrambled eggs, turkey ham, oatmeal and a glass of milk| 850 | 39 |\nLunch | 6 Sandwiches: 2x cheese, 2x PB, 2x ham and a glass of milk | 1050 | 34 |\nDinner | Ground beef with potatoes and veggies | 700 | 30 |\nSnack | Bowl of quark, a banana and a handful of walnuts | 400 | 27 |\n\n---\n##**Supplements**\n\n---\nI didnt take protein shakes, BCAAs, ZMA, etc. Simply because I could not afford it. The only supplements I have taken daily and will continue to do so are:\n\n\n+ Vitamin C\n* Vitamin D\n\n\nI feel like that's all I need for now. As my budget increases, I might consider experimenting with taking other supplements.\n\n---\n##**Sleep**\n\n---\nI know and feel sleep is important. School requires me to get up at 06:30. This is why I am in bed 22:30 Sunday to Friday. I religiously sleep 8 hours at least and about 8.5-9 in the weekend.\n\n---\n##**Habits**\n\n---\nI now workout three times a week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. I can't remember a moment in my life dedicating to something and being consistent with it before I started fitness.\n\n\nI also wake up and go to bed at the same time almost every day. Before I would wake up one day at 10 am and go to bed at 2 am.\n\n\nLast but not least I changed my way of eating from around barely 1300 calories a day to 3000 a day which was necessary for the gainz to be made.\n\n---\n##**Conclusion**\n\n---\nStarting to workout has been the best decision in my life so far. I have changed my habits and I have probably laid a good foundation for the rest of my fitness and life journey. I am feeling much happier and more productive in general.\n\n\nTraining wise I came to the conclusion that weighted work is much easier to program progressive overload allowing you to see more consistent gains. Due my dedication my brother bought me a gym membership. The past weeks I started with barbell squats and deadlifts. I missed out on so much ~~fun~~ leg gainz.\n\n----\n**Edit 1:** Thanks for the nice comments everyone. I've always been paying attention to school and performing well. Only thing that changed is that I am able to do more pullups now.\n\n\n**Edit 2:** I'm new to Reddit. Someone gave me a month's worth of Reddit Gold. Can somebody explain Reddit Gold to me?\n\n\n**Edit 3:** The workout is supposed to be done three times a week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Each workout takes about 50-80 min. For example 3x12 stands for 3 sets of 12 pushups.\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "I worked out three times a week for 4 months.

When I got back and looked at pictures of myself it really hit me that I was no longer that guy who could eat whatever he wanted and not gain any weight. In my teens and early twenties I was pretty active, played sports, and never had to pay much attention to what I ate. Somewhere along the lines I stopped being as active and everything started catching up with me. I started hitting the gym that week and haven\u2019t stopped since.\n\nI initially dropped from 205 to 178 in about 6 months, so about a pound per week \\(more in the beginning, less towards the end\\). I did IIFYM and IF and tried to eat about 80&#37; clean and 20&#37; treats. I lifted in the past for sports, so I knew my way around weights enough to get by. I started out with some random routine I found online that was some sort of reverse pyramid training 3 days a week, but I honestly can\u2019t remember exactly what it was. After my initial cut, I had kind of a fail on my first bulk and put on too much fat and not enough muscle. I cut down again and ended up around 181 with slightly higher body fat, so I didn\u2019t really add much mass.\n\nFinally did my first successful bulk/cut this past year starting last June. I just finished up cutting down for the summer from my bulked weight of 204 to 188 and am probably at the lowest body fat I\u2019ve ever been. I\u2019m guessing I\u2019ll end up around 190\\-192 when I start eating more again and upping my carb intake. For both the bulk and cut I did a PPL routine 6 days a week and dropped volume as needed during my cut. I stuck with IIFYM throughout and did IF when cutting. I also added some cardio towards the end of my cut, either walking up hill or jump rope.\n\nOverall I\u2019ve learned a lot these past couple years and have really enjoyed lifting and bodybuilding as a new hobby. Looking forward to starting my next bulk soon. Feel free to ask any questions, I\u2019d be happy to provide more info for those that are interested.\n\n**Pictures:** From top to bottom:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/7nNyXRj](https://imgur.com/a/7nNyXRj)\n\n1.

I try to mix it up and make different things but here are some go\\-tos:\n\n\u00b7 Chicken Tacos\n\n\u00b7 Chicken Stir fry \\(use riced cauliflower instead of rice when cutting\\)\n\n\u00b7 Pizza on cauliflower crust \\(Trader Joe\u2019s has a good one but it\u2019s on the higher end for carbs\\)\n\n\u00b7 Pasta \\(use spaghetti squash when cutting\\)\n\n\u00b7 Chicken chili\n\n\u00b7 Some prepackaged pastas, Indian food, etc from Trader Joes\n\n\u00b7 Lunch meat wraps on lavash \\(low cal for a large wrap with a lot of fiber\\)\n\n\u00b7 Protein shakes\n\nI like to try new things and my wife and I will often try different recipes and modify ingredients to make them \u201chealthier\u201d. It helps me keep on my diet to have some go to things where I know all the macros, but also try new things to keep from getting bored. However, I do eat pretty much the same turkey wrap for lunch every day. I\u2019m typically too busy during the day to care what I eat and it fits in with my macros well most of the time.\n\nWhen I\u2019m bulking I also add in things like bagels and cereal for extra carbs. I also have a protein shake almost every day.\n\nA sample cutting meal would be:\n\n\u00b7 10 AM Post Workout: Protein Shake\n\n\u00b7 12 PM lunch: Turkey wrap on lavash with chips \\(the baked Jalapeno chips\\) and sometimes another shake\n\n\u00b7 7 PM dinner: Chicken tacos with Mexican rice and veggies for dinner\n\nBulking is similar, but I add:\n\n\u00b7 A bagel with cream cheese for breakfast.\n\n\u00b7 Milk and sometimes fruit or peanut butter added to protein shake.\n\n\u00b7 More carbs with dinner, so have more rice with tacos for instance.\n\n\u00b7 A bowl of cereal with 2&#37; milk before bed.\n\n**Lifting:**\n\nI honestly don\u2019t remember much about my first routine when I initially lost weight and unfortunately I lost the spreadsheet I had on my phone. It was a reverse pyramid training program that was split up into a 3 day per week workout.\n\nMore recently I have been doing a PPL routine:\n\n6 days per week starting with push on Monday. I typically rest on Sundays, but sometimes in the middle of the week if something comes up. I\u2019ve subbed in different lifts at different times and like to play around with new lifts from time to time, but here is an example of what I would do on each day.\n\n**Push:** incline or flat bench \\(3x8\\), shoulder press \\(3x8\\), chest flyes \\(3x12\\), lateral raises \\(3x12\\), tricep extensions \\(3x12\\), tricep pull downs or dips \\(3x12\\)\n\n**Pull:** seated rows \\(3x8\\), weighted pull ups \\(3x8\\), single arm rows \\(3x12\\), face pulls \\(3x12\\), barbell curls \\(3x8\\), hammer curls \\(3x12\\)\n\n**Legs:** squats or leg press \\(3x8\\), straight leg deadlifts \\(3x8\\), leg extensions \\(3x12\\), leg curls \\(3x12\\), calf raises \\(3x12\\), some sort of abs \\(switched up frequently\\)\n\nI do different rep ranges from 4x6 to 3x12 and typically stick to higher weight lower reps for the compound exercises and vice versa for accessories, but I switch things up periodically to keep myself engaged.\n\nSome numbers:\n\nIncline bench: 215 3x8 \\(haven\u2019t done flat in a while honestly, but probably around 240 3x8\\)\n\nOHP: 160 3x8\n\nSquat: 275 3x5\n\nPull\\-ups: bw \\+ 55 3x8\n\nSeated rows: 215 3x8\n\nI don\u2019t deadlift anymore, but SLDL: 275 3x5\n\nI tore my hamstring a while back so leg numbers didn\u2019t progress as well as upper body since I had to stop training them for a while.\n\nI also add in some cardio like walking on the treadmill at an incline or jumping rope when I\u2019m near the end of my cut.\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\n**IF and IIFYM are great:** I think intermittent fasting is great for cutting. I\u2019m not sold on all the extra benefits that some claim it gives, but it does allow me to eat a giant delicious dinner every night, which really helps keep me on my diet. I also really enjoy IIFYM since it allows me to work in foods I really enjoy on a regular basis. Make sure to get enough micronutrients though as that can be easy to overlook sometimes. Eat your vegetables and take a multivitamin.\n\n**DON\u2019T DIRTY BULK:** If you really want to, go for it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. I had a great few months on my first \u201cbulk\u201d just eating whatever I wanted and getting nice and fat. But I ended up putting on mostly fat and made barely any progress once I cut down. If you\u2019re natural I just can\u2019t see a reason to do this. Your body can only put on so much muscle at a time. I still like bulking/cutting rather than doing a very slow bulk year\\-round because I think you get better results and I like switching it up, but you have to bulk within reason.\n\n**Stick with a program:** While I do like to tweak things here and there, I think it\u2019s important to stick to a base program for a decent period of time. Don\u2019t waste your time trying to find the new best thing every other month. Just pick something and stick to it. Unless you\u2019re a very advanced lifter most programs will work for you and you\u2019ll be more inclined to continue going to the gym if you stick with one routine. Feel free to make some small modifications if you want to keep things interesting or fit your needs better, but don\u2019t gut your whole program.\n\n**Weekly Treat/Cheat meals are awesome:** Every week I have one meal where I don\u2019t track the calories or macros at all, although I don\u2019t go too crazy and eat an entire pizza and order of breadsticks by myself. Typically my wife and I will go out to dinner somewhere. This really helps keep me on my diet and makes me feel good from both a mental and physical standpoint.\n\n**Have a workout buddy:** If you enjoy working out on your own that\u2019s definitely fine, but I find it helpful to have someone to lift with. My wife and I do a great job of keeping each other on track and doing thing like pushing the other to go to the gym when feeling lazy. It\u2019s nice to have someone else to help motivate you when you may not always have the motivation yourself.\n\n**Track your changes:** Take tons of measurements and progress pics. It\u2019s the only way to know for sure how you are progressing and it may seem tedious but you\u2019ll be thankful for that info when you want to reflect back and see how far you\u2019ve come. If you\u2019re a nerd like me, put it all in excel and make lots of charts :\\).\n\n**Fit in cardio where you can**: When you\u2019re cutting you can fit in random times to do cardio to help with the weight/fat loss. I used to walk to and from work which came out to around 3 miles of walking a day. I didn\u2019t realize it but it definitely added up. Also, my wife and I live in the city so we take nightly walks around the neighborhood. It\u2019s about a mile and half of walking and it\u2019s a nice added bonus of getting to spend extra time together.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "2.5 years progress of consistent lifting and controlling what I eat (IIFYM and IF when cutting)", "post_ups": 4893, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8ldda9/25_years_progress_of_consistent_lifting_and/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:08.475838", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "peginus", "post_created_utc": 1488067711.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "5w7a4v", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 477, "post_num_crossposts": 1, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 4882, "post_selftext": "[Here's the pics.](http://imgur.com/a/0IQCr)\n\nThe only decent gym in my area charges $50 per month and it's always packed, so I figured i'd try building a gym for the price of roughly a one year membership (~$600).\n\nHere's the rundown:\n\n* Standard weights (220 lbs), dumbbells, ez bar and standard bar on CL - $100\n* Olympic weights (400 lbs), olympic bar and pair of 35 lb hex dumbbells on CL - $200\n* [Olympic bar from Amazon - $70](https://www.amazon.com/CAP-Barbell-Olympic-2-Inch-Chrome/dp/B002OOYINA/ref=sr_1_4?s=exercise-and-fitness&ie=UTF8&qid=1488065079&sr=1-4&keywords=olympic+bar)\n* [Power Rack from Amazon - $200](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N4I8FOY/ref=ask_ql_qh_dp_hza)\n* [Bench from Amazon - $100](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OHQALU/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)\n* Floor mats - $80\n* Weight stand from play it again sports - $25\n* 5 54x24 mirrors on CL - $40\n\nTotal - $815\n\nI went a bit over my budget, but I might still end up selling some of those Olympic plates.  I justified the extra I spent by telling myself I can always just sell most of this stuff on CL and still end up with a relatively minimal loss compared to what I originally bought the stuff for.\n\nFor anyone thinking about doing something like this themselves, I can't recommend mirrors enough.  Not only do they let you look at your magnificent self while you lift heavy things, but they're terrific at both adding more light to the room and helps you keep your form in check.\n\nIf I had to do it all over again, I think the only thing I would do different is buying the heavy duty floor mats instead of the jigsaw ones.  You can tell they're cheap and they seem like they're already breaking down a bit.  I'm going to buy at least one to put underneath the Olympic bar i've got on the ground there.\n\nI'm also probably going to buy a pair of dip handles and something to tag onto the side of the cage to hold the rest of the weights i've got stacked in the corner, so I can use that space for stuff like curls and resistance band exercises.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Built a gym in my garage instead of buying a gym membership", "post_ups": 4882, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5w7a4v/built_a_gym_in_my_garage_instead_of_buying_a_gym/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:08.475838", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "balltothewallman", "post_created_utc": 1536507866.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1536522588.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "9edwes", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 559, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 4861, "post_selftext": "Progress Pics: https://imgur.com/a/6rkx5yC\n\nBackground: I had been working out off and on for years and years, but was often held back by diet, lack of discipline, lack of intensity, lack of volume. My girlfriend during these years always wanted to eat out and drink, and would always encourage me to skip it and say she doesn't like guys with muscles or six packs. Basically, I wasn't half assing it, I was quarter assing it. And when that relationship ended, I decided to finally commit myself to having the body I always wanted.\n\nAge: 29 Height: 5'11\n\nTimeline: ~Six months slow clean bulk (From 155lb to 177lbs) ~Four months cut (From 177lbs to 155lbs)\n\n\nRoutine:\n\nI started with PHAT, eventually moved to PPL, then back to PHAT when I began my cut.\nComplex freeweight movements. 18-21 sets on a bulk, 15-18 on a cut. Skip the machines.\nAt some point during your lifting, you should have a moment that scares you. When you're like fuck this is heavy I don't know if I can do this. Where you have to actually round up some grit to hit the numbers. you cannot make a change with a pedestrian mentality.\nEverything needs to be measured. Weight, bodyfat percentage, food/calories, rest periods, sets, lifts, reps, all of it. Write it all down. You need to set standards so you have an accurate picture of what you're trying to outdo the next time you visit the gym. These numbers will also be highly valuable to you half a year from now when you want to compare your progress.\nUse a simple pair of calipers and practice getting a consistent reading. It's more about comparing yourself to last week or last month than so much a truly accurate estimation of bodyfat percentage.\n\n\nMentality:\n\nIf you want to stop looking skinnyfat and start looking like a fit person, then you have to become one. You can't simply pretend to be one for an hour, a day, a month, and go back to your old habits. It is a permanent change. You have to literally become a new person, one with new habits and values.\nYou have to channel some kind of fuck you primal mentality. When you go to lift the heavy weight you have to feel this fuck you stupid piece of shit light weight aint fucking nothing bitch ass weight inside you.(inside you, not outside you making weird noises). You cannot have a pedestrian mentality.\nThe numbers must. go. up. you must beat last weeks high score. Again, and again, and again. But do NOT do this by lowering the range of motion, taking longer breaks, using momentum to lift instead of your muscles, cheating your form, etc. it must be in the same vein as your previous lifts.\n\n\nDiet: \n\n(bulk) TDEE + 500cal (cut) TDEE - 500cal + EC Stack TDEE Calculator: https://tdeecalculator.net/\n\nGet your one gram per 1lb lean body mass protein, but other than that, ignore all the fad diet low carb high carb no X no Z BS. Obviously you need to skip the sugar/fast food/etc., but other than that do whatever helps you stick to your goals. The harder/more restricted you make your diet the more likely it is you won't stick to it. I found it helpful to find 4-5 tasty meals that I genuinely enjoy, measure them so I know exactly what I'm eating and that it aligns with my TDEE needs, and eat them daily. This way I can skip the math and measurements more or less because I've done it.\n\n\nMake it easy for yourself. If every day is feeling like hell, you need to reevaluate. I did all this while happily eating bananas, whole wheat bread/tortillas, oats, Fresca (calorie free soda) and found dieting to be surprisingly easy. There was no need for a cheat day, ever. Hitting that TDEE - 500cal day consistency is more valuable than punishing yourself with nothing but chicken rice and broccoli every day, leading to a Saturday night binge.\n\n\nWhat I eat while cutting:\n\nMeal 1: 5 eggs 2 slices of toast 1 glass Fresca\n\nMeal 2: 2 Toast, 2 tbsp peanut butter, 2 Banana\n\nMeal 3: Whey Protein w/ Water + Cup of Oats\n\nMeal 4 (pre workout) one banana (post workout) one banana one scoop whey\n\nMeal 5: Veggie Burrito (boiled spinach, corn, beans, Newman's black bean salsa omg so good)\n\nsnack if needed: pickles. Pretty filling, almost no calories\n\nLift Numbers-\n\nWhen I was around 165lbs I had my best numbers(don't have record of my starting numbers). I didn't really value one rep maxes but to try and give an idea:\n\nDeadlift: 420lb x 1\n\nSquat: 295 x 9\n\nDumbbell Bench: 100's x 10 (barbell messes with my shoulders a lot) \n\ntl;dr progress pics- https://imgur.com/a/6rkx5yC", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "How I Finally Escaped Skinnyfat in 10 Months", "post_ups": 4861, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9edwes/how_i_finally_escaped_skinnyfat_in_10_months/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:08.475838", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "pianoelias", "post_created_utc": 1460991655.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1460992383.0, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "4fc8ta", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 436, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 4816, "post_selftext": "Here\u2019s the post: [It's Not Because You're Hungry \u2013 14 Ways to Control Your Eating](http://routineexcellence.com/its-not-because-youre-hungry-14-ways-to-control-your-eating/)\n\nHey /r/Fitness,\n\nThis is the third (and possibly final) guide I\u2019ve written for you guys. After the first two on [consistently going to the gym](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/49ubxy/i_made_a_guide_to_help_you_stop_being_lazy_and/) and [choosing a beginner weight training program](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4c7ha6/i_wrote_a_guide_to_help_you_choose_a_beginner/), I had dozens of requests for a guide on the psychology of eating and sticking to a consistent diet. \n\n**So, here it is.**\n\nWhen most people are asked why they eat, the answer is simple: \u201chunger.\u201d\n\nWe definitely do eat because we\u2019re hungry, but there are a million other factors that can cause us to eat more (or less) without realizing. Who we're with, where we are, what time it is, what we're eating off of, and where the food is all have a major impact on our eating habits. \n\nBy understanding the things that make us eat, we can adjust our lifestyles to effortlessly eat more or less. \n\n***One thing to note:*** I know /r/fitness loves counting calories. I agree that counting calories is effective and will work, but I also think that it can be tedious and overwhelming, especially for someone that is simultaneously trying to start an exercise habit. Changing too much at once can be a recipe for disaster. \n\nI personally don\u2019t count calories (I have, didn\u2019t like it much), and the advice in this guide is not geared towards calorie counting. That said, it will still be helpful to those that do count calories. Understanding why you\u2019re tempted to snack can help you resist (or encourage!) snacking and more easily hit your macros. \n\nThe guide is split into two parts:\n\n***Part One*** covers the common elements of our environment that cause us to over or undereat. You\u2019ll learn why you don\u2019t just eat when you\u2019re hungry, and begin to identify the deeply ingrained food habits that govern your behavior.\n\n***Part Two*** tackles the most common eating struggles we face as mindless eaters. You\u2019ll learn how to control portion size, how to control snacking, how to eat out less, and what to do when you eat out.  \n\nIn part one, we\u2019ll discuss some common elements of our environment that contribute to eating. Namely: \n\n* Social eating\n* Time-based eating\n* Clean-plate eating\n* Dish size\n* Accessibility of food\n\nIn part two, I provide 14 ways to manage the 3 major aspects of eating: Portion size, snacking, and eating out. \n\nPortion size: \n\n1. Use smaller dishes/utensils\n1. Keep serving dishes away from the table\n1. Get a new plate for each serving\n1. Slow down\n1. Be mindful (sometimes)\n\nSnacking:\n\n1. Hide your snacks\n1. Never eat from the bag\n1. Use a cookie counter\n1. Swap, don\u2019t stop\n1. Understand your snacking\n\nEating out:\n\n1. Meal prep\n1. Get better at cooking\n1. Track the cost of eating out\n1. Portion control\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that most of these tips seem geared towards people trying to lose weight. In each I also give tips for those trying to gain, but the tips are basically the same: do the opposite of the tactics you would use to lose weight. \n\nThis is the last mega-guide I\u2019ll post here for quite a while (I\u2019ll still be posting other stuff on my site), so I hope you find it useful.\n\nLet me know what you think!\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "I wrote a guide to help you manage your eating", "post_ups": 4816, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4fc8ta/i_wrote_a_guide_to_help_you_manage_your_eating/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:08.475838", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "msuk2girl", "post_created_utc": 1432760562.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1432765583.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "37iau1", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 719, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 4789, "post_selftext": "Two years ago, photo on the left, I was my heaviest. 162 lbs.\n\nI began running and and a little lifting.

I can bench 135, squat 235, and dead lift 225. I'm strong. I've learned to love my body and be confident. \n\nI began my cut at the end of March. Roughly 8 wks in and I'm down 7 lbs from when I started. Currently at 1600 cals with  P 35%/ F 35%/ C 30% break down. I follow IIFYM with mostly whole foods, and also cupcakes.\n\nToday I'm 143lbs, and in the best shape of my life.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/TLjppPP\n\nEdit:\nOk, going to try and handle all the questions-\n\nI'm 5'4\".\n\nI hit my heaviest right before getting pregnant, and worked out a bit after giving birth.

I also trained for a 5 and 10k at this time.\n\nDuring maintenance/growth I ranged from 1900 to 2100 calories.  Protein usually around 130g, fat usually around 70g, and the carbs move around the most.\n\nI'm losing fat right now on the 1600, P 35%/ F 35%/ C 30% break down.  I do cardio twice a week, 15 minutes hiit  on the spin bike, and 20 minute intervals on the step mill the other day. I lift 4 days a week. Have lost 7 lbs this way in 8 weeks.\n\nStrength on cut: My max efforts just aren't there, but I'm trying to make up for it in my work sets. My bench work sets have gone up, while I am unable to hit my max.  Squat is remaining the same.  Deadlift has been shaky as I've been dealing with a few injuries recently and I'm not in a hurry to max out.\n\nI loved 5x5.  It's really so easy to follow.  You modify for girls just as Mehdi says (going up less weight for upper lifts each session).  Get that form down!  Start with the bar, go up in small increments.\n\nAdvice for training fiance: the same as you.  Encourage her that lifting heavy will not make her big.  It's all based on genetics as well as body fat.\n\nBelly- belly skin: How bellies go back after kids is all based on genetics. I have a couple faint stretch marks, and if I suck in really tight, you can see loose skin just around the belly button.  I really got off easy.

Almost everything you do engages your core so your abs are getting worked every day (squats, bench)\n\n**Crunches and situps** ~~do not give you abs~~ are not the key to abs. They may make a small difference overtime. But they really do not add to the overall mass of them. If you want them quick, then engage them with heavy weight.\n\n\nAchieving this while working at McDonald's taught me that dieting doesn't have to consume your life and nor should it. This shows that you can splurge and look great at the same time. Before you ask, **Yes** I did eat McDonald's food while I worked there. And a lot of it! Nearly every day. My favorite was a Big Mac Double quarter pounder with bacon. That is a Big Mac with quarter pounder meat on it, not the little slivers of meat that come on the original sandwich lol. No their meat doesn't have horse in it and I love their grilled chicken. There are healthy foods to be had at McDonald's and other fast food chains for that matter. \n\nThe media destroys these companies when all they are doing is serving food. It is the customers responsibility to choose what they put in their body.\nAt the end of the day it is all about your **caloric intake** and work ethic!\n\nP.S. \n\nA McDonald's parfait is not exactly \"healthy\". That is pure sugar.\n\n**EDIT:** Wow this is scary. Front Page!? Thanks so much! You guys are awesome! My girlfriend is going to be so mad when she finds out how many people have seen me.\n\n**EDIT 2:** No, this is not advertisement by McDonald's Corp. This is just an average guy who surprisingly  found himself on the front page of Reddit. But if anyone knows a guy, who knows a guy in advertisement. I could use some change to get rid of these student loans ;)\n\n**EDIT 3:** Getting **a lot** of question so I will try and address a few of them now. I can't possibly answer all of them though, I'm sorry :(\n\nI do not know my max in any of my lifts, as I am not a power lifter or interested in the numbers. These pictures were taken over a year ago and I cannot remember what I was using for bench/squats/etc. I remember doing 225 for 8 on bench press a little after this cut. Put that in a one rep max calculator and its says it would be around 285 for my max. Who knows if those work or not. But again I will not try it because the numbers don't interest me. Just to give some of you an idea though, I am currently using 75lb dumbbells for overhead shoulder press, 100lb dumbbells for flat press, squats I do not go over 225. Bad knees run in the family. Had knee surgery in highschool. Pull-ups I tie 45 pound plate to me for added resistance.\n\nWorkouts: I like to go heavy on the compound movement, usually 8 to 10 reps when wanting to put on size, and reps of 5 when wanting to build strength. I like using strong lifts for building strength. I am a firm believer of working each body part at least twice a week. I like doing upper/lower body splits. Monday upper, Tuesday lower, Wednesday off, Thursday upper, Friday lower. Sat, Sun rest. Though I do not always follow this routine because I like to switch it up, but I always try to work each body part twice a week.\n\nI am by no means a professional and do not plan to be. Do what you think is best. This method just worked for me so I wanted to share it.\n\n**UPDATE:** No, I do not work at McDonald's anymore. I worked there while completing my Bachelor's Degree and Interning. Currently I am 183 lbs and started a career Information Technology. I continue to lift and plan my next cut in February, and should be done with it in May. Maybe I will see you guys again soon! Thanks for all the support! :)\n\n**SHOUT-OUT:** To the Hodgetwins who follow a very similar diet as what I have done here. They are a great YouTube Channel **(TwinMuscleWorkout) (FastingTwins) (Hodgetwins)** and I highly suggest checking them out! They approach dieting and training in a fun way, the same way as I, and I never miss one of their videos. They were a big part of my inspiration and they can inspire you guys as well!\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Here is My Body.

No disrespect to actual powerlifters - you guys are pimp as hell. This is for the beginners who were told to do Starting Strength + GOMAD.\n\n**Stop powerlifting**\n\n* Be honest with yourself. Picking up weights is often part of a general trend of self-improvement. Your mind doesn't like the idea that you're improving yourself - it implies your current self isn't up to par. This is why you rationalize going to the gym in other ways than wanting to better your looks. \"I don't care about having big muscles, I just like lifting weights\". \"Fuck these bros doing brosplits, I just want to squat heavy\". \"I think I might go to a PL event\". If you had to pick between increasing your squat by 100kg and gaining 12lbs of muscle, what would you pick?\n\n* Don't listen to the broscience. The myth that training your entire body releases hormones which stimulate growth everywhere has been [debunked](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/research-review/physiological-elevation-of-endogenous-hormones-results-in-superior-strength-training-adaptations-research-review.html/). Squatting heavy won't make your biceps grow.\n\n* Look at the weekly volume in SS. Legs: 70. Shoulders: 22. Chest: 22. Upper back: 22. Does this seem aligned with your goals?\n\n**Instead**\n\n* Equal pushing (bench + press), pulling (pull-up + row), and legs volume. Aim for ~60-120 (lyle mcd's rec) per week for each. Upper / lower 4 days a week, full / body, push pull legs, it doesn't really matter, do what's most convenient for your schedule, just don't push, pull, or legs two days in a row.\n\n* Consider adding isos for bis, shoulders, and chest (curls, face pulls + lat raises, flies), because push exercises are tricep dominant, and pull exercises are back dominant.\n\n* Consider leg exercises that are more aligned with general balanced strength and physique than powerlifting (front squat + RDL emphasize anterior and posterior chain respectively, ie they will get you abs and glutes, whereas the powerlifts are all posterior chain heavy). Do you have anterior pelvic tilt from the strong lower back and weak abs you get doing low-bar squat-mornings three times a week? Switching to front squats will fix this.\n\n* Keep the good parts of beginner PL programs: heavy strength work and consistent progression with a fixed scheme rather than playing it by ear.\n\n* Don't make all your work sets of 5 or you will burn out and spend ages having to rest. Do some heavy strength work first, and follow it up with higher rep sets for volume. Base the weights for all your sets off percentages of your 1RM, and have a progression scheme for your 1RM (weekly, biweekly, every workout, whatever floats your boat / matches your experience level).\n\n**Cutting**\n\n\n* Cutting forces you to actually pay attention to what you eat rather than just eating a shitton under the excuse that you're 'bulking'. If you start by successfully getting lean, you will have reached a point where fitness is part of your lifestyle and you  have the discipline to stick to it.\n\n* Cutting to low body fat makes your face and body look better. Gaining muscle mass when you're not lean doesn't make you look much better until you cut later on.\n\n* Low body fat makes it easier to gain mass, and it makes your gains more apparent, which is important for motivation.\n\n* After a cut you are ready to slow bulk. Your body shape won't change drastically, you will always be pretty low bf% with an added pound every month or two. This is useful if you like having clothes that fit.\n\nHope this helps. I wish someone had told me this when I started.\n\n\n\nEDIT: stop with the 'SS' or 'shitty program where you won't make any gains' dichotomy.\n\n    Mon\n    press 3x5 @ 85%\n    bench 3x8 @ 70%\n    front squat 3x5 @ 85%\n    sldl 3x8 @ 70%\n    face pull 2x10\n    lat raise 2x10\n\n\n    Wed\n    sldl 3x5 @ 85%\n    front squat 3x8 @ 70%\n    row 3x5 @ 85%\n    pull-up 3x8 @ 70%\n    curls 4x8\n\n\n    Thur\n    bench 3x5 @ 85%\n    press 3x8 @ 70%\n    pull-up 3x5 @ 85%\n    row 3x8 @ 70%\n    chest fly 4x10\n    curls 4x8\n\nEach day two movements out of three (push, pull, and legs), balanced volume, still heavy strength work, same amount of compounds to learn as SS + curls, flies, lat raises, and face pulls, similar length workouts as 3x8 sets don't require much rest, increase 1RMs weekly and deload when you stall.

I tried my best to write for the layman but also not oversimplifying anything. I originally wrote all of this on an external page which will not be linked here but for those who wish to see it, kindly DM me. Regardless, I hope you all learn something and enjoy reading this. This is all written for educational purposes so any discussion or comments within this thread are very encouraged! Also, if everything is far too wordy for you, I have included TL;DRs for each section.\n\nThe covered topics: The anabolic window, intermittent caloric restriction, protein supplementation, omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants and squat technique (chronological order).\n\nThe first paper that we will cover is a short one by Schoenfeld & Aragon (2018) in which they reviewed the literature on the \u201canabolic window\u201d for protein intake after training. Short-term studies had conflicting results but a meta-analysis conducted by Schoenfeld, Aragon & Krieger (2013) actually showed a minor benefit to consuming protein immediately after a training bout in terms of muscle hypertrophy. However, after more analysis where they controlled for more variables, they found that this small benefit was more attributed to overall protein intake. This is because some studies did not match for daily protein intake between groups meaning that some groups were having a higher daily protein intake than some other groups (which is generally considered to be more important than intake timing).\n\nThis meta-analysis has what we call a \u201cheterogeneity\u201d in the literature used. This simply means that the papers pooled and analyzed together widely differed in methods, populations and outcomes. So amongst those papers, we could see different protein intakes, training and untrained individuals and some being matched and not matched for daily protein intake. The review highlighted a trial done by Schoenfeld, Aragon, Wilborn, Urbina, Hayward & Krieger (2017) where 21 trained participants exercised 3 times a week for 10 weeks while either being allocated to a group that consumed 25 grams of whey protein immediately before or after a training session. Hypertrophy was similar between groups but the dietary control in the study was questionable as subjects actually ate at a reported calorie intake that was lower than baseline when they were supposed to be bulking.\n\nIt is still up in the air as to whether there is any real benefit but all in all, the authors suggest that if there is any effect, it is likely very small. They also propose that a meal 3\u20134 hours before a workout is likely good enough as the anabolic response to a meal lasts up to 6 hours (Layman, 2004). 0.4/0.5 g/kg of protein intake pre or post exercise is also advised to be sufficient.\n\n**TL;DR:** There may be some advantage to eating protein immediately after a workout but it may be very small. More rigorous research needs to be conducted. Meals 3\u20134 hours before training and 0.4/0.5 g/kg of protein pre/post workout may yield adequate results.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nA randomized control trial studying the effects of intermittent caloric restriction (compared to a standard, continuous caloric restriction) on body composition and other bio markers in 136 men and women was recently published. Sch\u00fcbel et al. (2018) split all subjects into 3 groups. The first group did continuous caloric restriction where the daily caloric deficit was around 20%. The second group followed a 5:2 pattern for intermittent caloric restriction in which 2 non-consecutive days of the week consisted of a caloric deficit of 75%. The final group was a control group; a group with no advice to lose body mass.\n\nThe first 12 weeks of the study (intervention phase) had the subjects work closely with dietitians to help follow their allocated diet plans. This included face-to-face sessions as well bi-weekly phone calls. The following 12 weeks (maintenance phase) had no advice from any dietitians but the participants did receive motivational support. In the final 26 weeks (follow-up phase), the subjects received no help whatsoever. Scales and diaries were provided to everyone to help track and follow their diets.\n\nThe primary outcome chosen by the researchers was the expression (taking genetic information and turning it into a product) of 82 genes that are related to the pathophysiology of obesity. Other studied variables include body mass index, blood pressure, waist circumference, body fat, liver fat, diet compliance and quality of life.\n\nDuring the intervention phase, the intermittent caloric restriction group actually lost more body mass (-7.1%) compared to the continuous restriction group (-5.2%) but the p-value was just above significance (p=0.053). This just means that if were to repeat the experiment (assuming there is no difference between interventions and that results are obtained purely by chance), the chance of seeing a more extreme result is above a level that is considered safe. Anyways, after the 50 weeks, the percentage losses were a lot closer, -5.2% vs 4.9% for intermittent caloric restriction and continuous restriction respectively with no statistical significance. For the primary outcomes (gene expression), there was no difference. Between sub-groups like male vs female or overweight vs obese, there were no differences. There were no differences in biomarkers or quality of life.\n\nAn interesting finding was that the intermittent caloric restriction group had the worst compliance in the later weeks. From 49 participants, only 9 were doing 2 energy-restricted days per week at the final week. This may be reflected in the fact that the intermittent caloric restriction group had a higher mass re-gain after week 24 compared to the continuous restriction group. Despite this, there were never any significant differences in any body composition variables at any time point in the study. \n\n**TL;DR:** Intermittent caloric restriction is a valid method for weight loss but there does not seem to be a metabolic advantage from 5:2 intermittent caloric restriction over continuous restriction in overweight individuals. It may be harder to follow the intermittent caloric restriction diet for an extended period of time.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nThe next study was carried out amongst new recruits in the US army while doing their Initial Entry Training (IET). IET is basically where civilians learn the fundamentals of being a soldier and improve their fitness before moving on to become trained soldiers. The programme is known to be quite tough and part of this is due to the documented caloric deficit (~600kcals) that most of the recruits suffer from during training (McAdam, McGinnis, Ory, Young, Frug\u00e9, Roberts & Sefton, 2018). McAdam et al. (2018) sought to see if there was an effect from whey protein supplementation on body composition measures (body mass and skin folds) as well as fitness test results amongst 69 male recruits.\n\nThe investigation was done in a double-blinded fashion (both the subjects and the researchers did not know who was getting which intervention) and the intervention lasted 8 weeks. Two servings (293 kcal, 40g protein) of whey protein were given per day (morning and night). Another group received a carbohydrate placebo that was matched for calories. Dietary analysis was done through logs completed by subjects in week 1 and 9 on 3 non-consecutive days.\n\nBoth groups maintained about the same body mass and gained similar amounts of lean mass, however, there was a statistically significant, greater fat loss in the whey protein supplemented group with a large effect size (-4.6kg vs -2.7kg). An effect size is basically a numerical measure on how strong one variable affects another. It is generally categorized into small, medium or large effect sizes. In terms of fitness, the amount of sit-ups done in 2 minutes as well as the 2 mile run timing did not differ between groups despite seeing improvements in both groups. For push-ups, the whey protein group performed 7 more on average in 2 minutes (medium effect size).\n\n\nDespite having regimented meals and meal times, dietary control was an issue with this study. There was a documented ~150 daily kcal intake difference between groups favoring the whey protein group. Therefore, the results may be due to the higher kcal intake rather than the higher protein intake or it may be more of a combination. There was also a great difference between all the subjects in terms of training history as evidenced by the extreme variation in lean mass between recruits at baseline. Training history has an effect on bodily response to protein as well as fitness. Lastly, this study lacks a control group. Regardless of these problems, it is clear that the additional calories ingested by the recruits had a positive effect on their fitness. Perhaps such a dietary approach can be adopted by the U.S. army in the future.\n\n**TL;DR:** The whey protein supplemented group had more body fat loss and higher push-up counts compared to carbohydrate supplemented group consisting of young males. This study, however, contains a few shortcomings in design (no kcal/training history matching).\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nA review on omega-3 fatty acid (n-3PUFA) supplementation for sports performance was recently published (Philpott, Witward & Galloway, 2018). From the work of Smith et al. (2011), we see that n-3PUFA supplementation has the potential to increase muscle protein synthesis (MPS) rates in response to protein intake. Muscle protein synthesis is the addition of muscle proteins to muscle, the building blocks of muscle. The main acids of discussion are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA). EPA and DHA is mostly derived from fish oils while ALA is more from plant-based oils like soybean oil. An in-vitro (experiments done in controlled environments like laboratories instead of in living organisms like humans) study by Kamolrat & Gray (2013) found that DHA has no effect on MPS while EPA does. However, these effects on MPS may be redundant because optimal protein intake likely saturates any amelioration in MPS.\n\nUnfortunately, no studies looking at the effects of n-3PUFA supplementation of muscle strength/hypertrophy in the young and athletic exist. Although, there is some evidence suggesting muscle strength/hypertrophy and performance benefits in older men and women(Smith, et al., 2015; Rodacki, et al., 2012). There is theory for n-3PUFAs to help with synthesizing mitochondria. The mitochondria are parts of a cell that have the role of producing energy for our body. However, only one study examined this relationship and while there was a positive correlation, it was conducted in obese subjects (Laiglesia et al., 2016). Therefore, the use of n-3PUFAs for improving endurance is largely still theoretical especially in the athletic population.\n\nThere is also some theory in n-3PUFAs having a positive effect on insulin sensitivity but it is mostly not understood. In a rodent study, increased expression of GLUT4 (protein which transports glucose to muscle, lowering blood glucose) was seen with n-3PUFA supplementation but any of this has yet to be seen in human experiments (Lanza, et al., 2013). Kawabata, Neya, Hamazaki, Watanabe, Kobayashi & Tsuji (2014) found reduced oxygen consumption with n-3PUFA supplementation in untrained, young males. This may be linked to insulin sensitivity theory as increased insulin sensitivity leads to more glycogen in muscles which would displace fat use for energy and less oxygen consumption as a result. This effect may not have such a considerable effect in sporting performance as Hingley, Macartney, Brown, McLennan, & Peoples (2017) found no improvement in time trial times, strength or average power with n-3PUFA use despite an observed reduction in oxygen consumption.\n\nn-3PUFAs have anti-inflammatory properties so it has been proposed that they can support the recovery process after sport/exercise. However, the literature shows equivocal results. Finally, there is interesting discussion as to whether or not n-3PUFAs can aid in the recovery from a concussion as substantial amounts of DHA can be found in the brain. Wang et al. (2013) showed that rats had better cognitive performance with n-3PUFAs compared with rats that had soybean oil. The closest human evidence to all this theory was obtained by Oliver et al. (2016) in which less concentrations of a biomarker for head trauma was seen in American football players who ingested n-3PUFAs.\n\n**TL;DR:** Omega 3 fatty acids have potential to improve muscle strength/hypertrophy, endurance, recovery and concussion recovery but much more evidence is needed before any recommendations can be made.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nDutra, Alex, Mota, Sales, Brown & Bottaro (2018) ran a randomized control study to evaluate the relationship between antioxidants and muscle strength, hypertrophy and fatigue. 42 young women participated in the study and they were separated into 3 groups. The first group ingested 1000mg of vitamin C and 400IU of vitamin E daily. The second group received a placebo and the last group was the control. Everyone followed a periodized training programme consisting of 2 upper body and 2 lower body exercises 2 times per week for 10 weeks.\n\nThere were no reported differences in lower body muscle thickness, fatigue or strength. Furthermore, only the placebo group showed an improvement over control in peak torque and total work done. This indicates that antioxidant supplementation has a negative effect on muscular performance. It is unknown as to why the researchers did not assess the same variables in the upper body. The use of a dynamometer as a measure of strength limits applicability to training as more specific measurements like 1RM bench press or squat would give more realistic results. Finally, there was little to no dietary control within this study.\n\n**TL;DR:** Antioxidant use was detrimental to muscular performance amongst young women.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nComfort, McMahon & Suchomel (2018) undertook a review in search of the optimum squat technique. They defined optimum technique as having the least injury risk, most muscle activation and most carry-over to athletic performance. In regards to safety, they noted that squats are generally safer for the knee ligaments when compared to other leg exercises like leg extensions, however, the strain on the posterior collateral ligament increases with squat depth (Zheng, Fleisig, Escamilla & Barrentine, 1998). Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) strain can also be minimized by keeping the heels on the ground likely due to less tibial displacement (your shinbone moving around) with the heels on the ground (Toutoungi, Lu, Leardini, Catani & O\u2019Connor, 2000).\n\nSome people suggest to keep the knees behind the toes in the squat especially if you want to preserve knee joint health. While this does decrease the knee joint forces by 22%, it increases the hip joint forces by over 1000% and it may have negative effects on the lumbar spine due to a more forward trunk lean (Fry, A. C., Smith, J. C. & Schilling, B. K., 2003). One final point to make on injury risks is that using lighter loads for greater depth will not necessarily decrease the joint stress at the knee because the knee still has to withstand more force from the higher knee flexion angles as a result of increased squat depth.\n\nAs for squat depth, deep squats are better than 1/2 and 1/4 squats for strength and performances like jumping (Weiss, Andrew, Wood, Relyea & Melton, 2000; Hartmann, Wirth, Klusemann, Dalic, Matuschek & Schmidtbleicher, 2012). Part of these results were in conflict with a study done by Rhea et al. (2016) where sprints and jump performances were improved best in the 1/4 squat depth group when compared to those who did 1/2 depth or full depth squats. Bazyler, Sato, Wassinger, Lamont & Stone (2014) discovered that the addition of partial range of motion squats to full-depth squats over 7 weeks led to greater 1 rep-maximums against those who did only full-depth squats in trained men. However, this may simply just have to do with the increased volume as well as increased training intensity for those who did partial squats.\n\nDigressing to muscle activation, smith machine squats have been shown to decrease activation in a couple of the quadriceps muscles (Schwanbeck, Chilibeck & Binsted, 2009). Before continuing, it is important to discuss the relation of electromyography (EMG, recording electrical activity from muscles) to muscle strength/hypertrophy. Correlation with strength has been documented by Hof (1997). The correlation with hypertrophy is not perfect but it is strongly correlated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for measuring muscle activation and fMRI can adequately forecast muscle hypertrophy (Dickx, D\u2019hooge, Cagnie, Deschepper, Verstraete & Danneels, 2010; Wakahara, Fukutani, Kawakami & Yanai, 2013).\n\nIn an EMG study run by Caterisano et al. (2002), the full squat was found to have had better activation in the glutes compared to parallel or partial squats. A more recent EMG experiment from Bryanton, Kennedy, Carey & Chiu (2012) discovered greater EMG responses in the knee extensors (quadriceps) with deeper squats but not in response to heavier loads. The glutes, however, responded more to heavier loads and deeper squats as well. This suggests the quadriceps can be \u201cisolated\u201d in a sense with low load, deep squats.\n\nFoot rotation has only been reported to have an effect on hip abductor activation (the smaller glute muscles that sit under the gluteus maximus) with external rotation (feet turned out) and this rotation may allow for greater depths to be achieved (Pereira, Leporace, Chagas, Furtado, Praxedes & Batista, 2010). Lastly, an increased stance width (beyond shoulder width) results in more glute and adductor longus (thigh muscle under the quads, moves leg towards body along the lateral plane) activation.\n\nIn the end, the authors recommend a squat with a \u201cnatural\u201d stance width / foot rotation, heels on the floor, full depth (115\u2013125 degrees of knee flexion), neutral spine and free movement of the knees (allowed to go over toes).\n\n**TL;DR:** Squats are fine for knee ligaments. Heels on floor = less ACL strain. Knees behind toes cause more hip joint stress. Deep squats generally better. Smith machine may have less activation of relevant muscles, greater depth has better activation, feet rotation does not have much of an effect and wider stance width can activate glutes more.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nBazyler, C.

I eat 5 meals/day, all healthy foods, but once a week I treat myself with a big plate of sushi. **LOVE SUSHI!** I'm thinking about trying intermittent fasting or limiting my meals to 3 big ones per day because I've read a lot of research about it and it seems like a good way to improve health and body composition.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**T R A I N I N G**\n\nBefore:\n\nSame as with the food.

It's technically the most important muscle in your body because if you can't chew and eat your food properly, you die. (Barring smoothie/ice cream technology, of course!) And because it works so often and hard, it can cause issues as well. You can stretch it by trying to open your mouth as much as possible but self-massaging it is just as important of a tool in my opinion.\n\n#Link: https://youtu.be/w-c1rt4zSGY\n\nThis self-massage trick is one of those I always incorporate in the middle of a yoga routine or self-massage routine.

Hope you are all having a wonderful Chinese new year for those who celebrate. As usual, I've collected a few interesting studies and wrote short summaries of them for all of you to read. All for educational purposes and to spark some discussion. The paper on sleep is not entirely related to fitness but it is health-related and I thought it would be interesting nonetheless.\n\nThe first study we will look at is a review written by Schoenfeld & Aragon (2018) and it asks the question: how much protein can muscles use for growth in one meal? This is actually a common question thrown around in the fitness world as a lot of people want to be as efficient as possible and want to maximize protein\u2019s effects on muscle growth in each meal. However, as odd as it sounds, sometimes the question is asked incorrectly. For the question above, some people will ask how much protein can be absorbed in one meal as opposed to how much can be used for muscle growth maximally. All protein will be absorbed but the real question is what happens to all of it afterwards.\n\nThe review highlights the study conducted by Areta et al. (2013) which is commonly cited to say that 20\u201325 grams of protein is the maximum number that muscles can use for hypertrophy (muscular growth). In this study, trained individuals were given different amounts of protein in a 12 hour period post-workout. Some were supplemented with 10 grams every 1.5 hours, some 20 grams every 3 hours and some 40 grams every 6 hours. In this experiment, the group that consumed 20 grams had the greatest rates of muscle protein synthesis (a fancy term to describe the building of muscles with protein). This would suggest that eating around 20 grams of protein at a time would be the best for building muscle. The biggest limitation that this review noted in the aforementioned study was that the total protein amounts used over the 12 hour period were quite low practically. Individuals training for hypertrophy would be consuming much greater amounts of protein overall.\n\nTo challenge the previous study, the review presents a paper done by Macnaughton et al. (2016) in which 40 grams of protein elicited greater muscle protein synthesis than 20 grams in the context of full body training. Another experiment carried out by Kim et al. (2016) found that 70g of beef protein showed a more significant anabolic response than 40g of beef protein. However, it should be noted that this response was measured as a whole body response and not just for muscle protein synthesis. Therefore, it is impossible to say which amount is better for muscle protein synthesis in the context of this study.\n\nFor women, Arnal et al. (1999, 2000) found that one meal with a large amount of protein was better than the same amount spread across several meals in regards to muscle retention. These results are interesting but a limitation to extrapolation is that no resistance training was taking place amongst the subjects.\n\nMuscle retention is also similar between those who follow intermittent fasting and those who diet continuously (Seimon et al., 2015). This would suggest that daily protein taken all at once would have the same effects on muscle as spreading out your protein intake across the day.\n\nIn the end, the authors of this review recommend 0.4\u20130.55 g/kg/meal which follows daily recommended intakes stated in a meta-analysis produced by Morton et al. (2017).\n\n**TL;DR:** It still is not clear what the optimum number of grams of protein per meal for maximizing muscular growth is but 0.4\u20130.55 g/kg/meal appears to be a safe recommendation based on the current literature.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nWe will now eat into a study done by Lee et al. (2018) in which differences between the conventional deadlift and the Romanian deadlift were investigated. For those who do not know what a Romanian deadlift is, it is essentially a normal deadlift starting from the top (barbell at waist) and then descending the barbell down until the hamstrings cannot stretch any further while not flexing at the lumbar spine. The knees cannot bend further than roughly 15 degrees. It may sound like a stiff-legged deadlift, however, in a stiff legged deadlift, you generally start from the bottom and your knees are allowed to bend more allowing you to bring the barbell to the floor. If you are referring to the straight-legged deadlift, the knees would not flex at all and the barbell would not drag along the legs in the descent.\n\nThe study recruited 21 males with at least 3 years of both conventional and Romanian deadlift experience with their training occurring at least twice a week. The first day involved 1 repetition maximum testing as this would facilitate selecting the appropriate load for the participants during the trial (subjects would be doing 5 reps of each lift at 70% of their 1 repetition maximum). To examine muscle activation, the scientists used electromyography. To put it simply, this is where electrodes are pasted over certain muscles to measure the electrical activity from the muscles.\n\nThe conventional deadlift showed more activation in the rectus femoris (a quadricep muscle, one that helps extend your knee and flex your hip) and slightly more activation in the gluteus maximus (your butt). Activation of the biceps femoris (a hamstring muscle) was similar between the two lifts which is interesting considering that many believe that the Romanian deadlift helps target the hamstrings better compared to the conventional deadlift.\n\nTorque (force produced about a joint) was much higher in the knee for the conventional deadlift which was probably expected considering the knee goes through a much larger range of motion. Similarly, the torque measured at the ankles were also higher in the conventional deadlifts which may suggest higher calf muscle activity though this was not measured in the study.\n\nSome important design aspects to note that affect generalizability is that we may see different results with different loads/intensities. Another issue regarding intensity is that the loads were selected according to the 1 repetition maximum of the subject\u2019s Romanian deadlift. Therefore, the conventional deadlift loads may not truly be 70% of their conventional deadlift 1 repetition maximum. It is safe to say that the intensities in this study were likely not matched. Finally, the hamstrings consist of several muscles but only one hamstring muscle was observed during the experiment.\n\n**TL;DR:** The conventional deadlift may be better at targetting the quadriceps and the gluteal muscles. Against what is commonly thought, the Romanian deadlift may not be better than the conventional deadlift at hitting the hamstrings, however, more comprehensive electromyography analysis should be done before making a solid statement.\n\nEDIT: As pointed out by u/bleearch, the Romanian deadlift may be beneficial for those who have knee problems as you get to enjoy the same hamstring activation while going through less knee torque.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nA large study conducted by Wild et al. (2018) explored the effects of duration of sleep on cognition. The team created a questionnaire which tested various human cognitive aspects like short-term memory, reasoning, spatial working and planning. However, the main areas that were being observed were short term memory, reasoning and verbal ability. At the same time, questions about sleep were asked to see the relationship between the person\u2019s sleep and their cognitive ability. The questionnaire was set up as an online survey in which they were able to gather 10,886 subjects.\n\nFirstly, it appears that as a person ages, their sleep duration decreases.\n\nAll areas of cognition were affected by sleep duration except for short term memory. This is likely because short term memory is a low-order cognitive process, it is not as complex as something like problem solving. Looking at the graphs below, we can clearly see an inverted-U for almost all cognitive areas which tells us that both too little and too much sleep has negative effects on cognition. Even when the authors thinned the analyzed subjects by removing extremes from both ends of the results, they still saw the inverted-U.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/NFHXzuV\n\nThe most optimal sleep duration for overall cognitive ability according to these results is 7.38 hours. Any duration over 8 hours likely has a negative effect on cognition and the authors were able to reliably find negative effects below 6.26 hours of sleep. It was also highlighted that even a single night of sleep had effects on cognition the next day. People who are chronically poor sleepers can benefit from just a single night of good quality sleep and the same vice-versa (good sleepers are affected by one bad night). Sleeping less than usual or sleeping 2.76 hours more than usual on one night showed negative effects for cognition on average.\n\nDespite sleep duration decreasing with age, the results showed that age has no effect on the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive ability. An interesting fact illustrated by this study is that if one were to sleep less than four hours in a night, you would experience a cognitive impairment that is the same as adding 8 years to your age (cognitive ability worsens with age).\n\nClear limitations of this study include the cross-sectional nature of the study (we are only looking at a snapshot of these people\u2019s lives, long term effects of sleep duration are not seen), the lack of people over 70 years old as well as children / adolescents and the fact that all these results were self-reported. Regarding the last point, the authors explain that the self-reporting still has moderate correlation with objective data.\n\n**TL;DR:** Getting 7 hours of sleep appears to be optimal for cognition. Sleeping any less or more shows some cognitive deficit. Even a one night\u2019s sleep can show acute effects on cognition.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nThe next study is a new meta-analysis done by Grgic et al. (2019) seeing whether or not the time of the day you do your training has an effect on muscle growth or strength. A meta analysis is where you pool the results of several studies together and is generally seen as the greatest form of scientific evidence. Previous research appears to be equivocal in regards to the effects of training time and muscle strength/growth with some studies showing a more positive effect in evening training and some presenting no difference at all between times.\n\nIn total, the authors collected 11 studies for analysis. At baseline, people were stronger in the evening which suggests that people are naturally stronger in the evening. The authors postulate that this could be due to increased body temperatures in the evening or perhaps some hormonal reason. People who trained in the morning had no difference between strength tests in the morning or evening. However, those who trained the evening were stronger than they were in the morning. This introduces a benefit to morning training as it will make you stronger throughout the entire day in contrast to evening training which would only make you stronger in the evening. In terms of muscle hypertrophy, no differences were found at all.\n\nUnfortunately, all of these studies used maximal voluntary contractions to measure strength instead of 1 repetition maximum tests. 1 repetition maximum tests are more practical because they test the strength of movements that you actually train in the gym. There are also not many studies looking at time of training and muscle hypertrophy thus presenting a gap in the literature. Finally, the studies were quite heterogeneous in terms of participants\u2019 ages.\n\n**TL;DR:** People seem to be stronger in the evening at baseline, however, unlike evening training, morning training will make you stronger throughout the entire day. Any conclusions regarding muscle growth is difficult to make due to the paucity of research on the subject though for now there appears to be no relationship.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nThe last paper we will look at was written by Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2017). Caffeine is a stimulant that is often consumed prior to training to boost muscular strength and endurance. Its effects are well documented and the research strongly supports caffeine as a valuable ergogenic aid (Grgic et al., 2018). The paper at hand investigated the effects of habitual caffeine intake on its efficacy during training. In other words, they ask if one were to consume caffeine regularly, would they build a tolerance to it and experience less of its benefits in training?\n\nThe most likely theory for the way caffeine works is that it binds to adenosine receptors in the body. Amongst many functions, adenosine can make one feel sleepy and even bring down the heart rate of the body. Now, the worries that caffeine may have a reduced effect with habitual intake stem from the process where caffeine use will cause the body to create more adenosine receptors which allows more adenosine to bind to its receptors.\n\nThe scientists recruited 40 male, trained cyclists to take part in the experiment. The study was designed in a crossover manner and in a double-blinded fashion. A crossover study means that all the participants got to try all treatments. In this case, every subject was supplemented with 6 mg/kg of caffeine for a week, was given a placebo for another week and was given nothing for another week. A double blind simply means that neither the scientists nor the subjects knew which treatment was being administered which helps reduce bias.\n\nThe cyclists were grouped according to their caffeine intake prior to being recruited into the study. The low intake group consumed 58 mg/day on average, the moderate intake group at 143 mg/day and the high intake group at 351 mg/day. To put these numbers into perspective, the high intake group is worth about 4.5 250ml cans of Red Bull in terms of caffeine.\n\nThe first day involved some simple body measurements as well as some testing to determine how much the cyclists needed to perform during real testing later on. The next couple of days consisted of familiarization with the time trial tests that the cyclists would have to do. The time trial basically required each cyclist to cycle a certain amount and then the time to completion would be measured. Caffeine 24 hours before the time trial was restricted and a 24 hour dietary recall before each test was also implemented to control caffeine intake. Subjects fasted 6 hours before each time trial and if they were being supplemented with 6 mg/kg of caffeine, it was done 1 hour before the time trial. Rate of perceived exertion was also measured throughout the trial.\n\nCyclists performed 2\u20133% better when on caffeine compared to placebo/control. There was no difference between placebo and control. Rate of perceived exertion was similar between all treatments.\n\nThe same trends were seen regardless of caffeine intake habits. That is to say, even they were in the high habitual intake group, the benefits from caffeine were the same.\n\nIt would appear that regardless of whether or not you consume a lot of caffeine, you can still reap all the ergogenic benefits of the stimulant. However, I am curious to see if we would see the same results in a strength training context. Also, it is worth noting that these results can only be generalized to males.\n\n**TL;DR:** Whether you use a lot of caffeine or not, you will not build a tolerance and not experience less benefits during training.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nAreta, J.

Pictures and videos are at the bottom of the post. If you have any questions, tips or whatever, feel free to post!\n\n##PROGRESS STORY AND WORKOUT PROGRAM DETAILS:\nI first began exercising in May 2015 as the typical skinny gamer nerd guy weighing in at 115 lbs (https://i.imgur.com/ZtTHJ3c.jpg). For the first few months, I followed a bodyweight program due to feeling too intimidated to go to the gym. I started drinking a ton of milk every day, almost gomad, just to gain weight. I didn't keep track of calories in this time.\n\nI started going to the gym Around October-November 2015, and began with stronglifts 5x5. The app and website were extremely helpful in getting me accustomed to the primary lifts and took away some of the intimidation factor of going into the gym. I followed stronglifts pretty consistently until April where I reached 155 lbs (https://i.imgur.com/k3vij7m.jpg), eating with a ~500 caloric surplus or more every day. \n\nAt that point, I asked reddit for advice, and a few people told me to cut so I began eating at a 500 deficit. I also used to play a ton of basketball, so I lost 10 lbs pretty fast in about a month. During my cut, I switched to PHUL since trying to do 5x5 squats was absolutely miserable on a cut. I also felt like my upper body was neglected, and PHUL had a lot more variety in that area.\n\nIn between I bulked way too hard and made little progress so in January 2017 I was back at 155 lbs (https://i.imgur.com/eR8mvuR.jpg). I dialed it back down, cutting down to 134 by august (https://imgur.com/MavWGVR). \n\nI began bulking more cleanly this time. I went from doing PHUL to 5-day nSuns and have made a lot of progress in all of my lifts. In the 4 months I've been doing nsuns, I've eaten at a 2800 calorie diet (supposedly ~400 surplus according to https://tdeecalculator.net/) and my body weight has gone from 134 to 138 lbs. My lifts have drastically improved with bench increasing from 185x5 to 225x3 and squat increasing from 275x5 to 315x3. https://i.imgur.com/hh816bf.jpg (More final physique pictures at bottom of post). \n\n##TIPS:    \n\nIf you're a beginner don't actually start with stronglifts 5x5! Squats every day made me a T-rex with huge quads and no upper body. I'd recommend beginners start with the more balanced Greyskull's LP that you can find in this subreddit's sidebar. \n\nI was suffering from shoulder impingement issues for a long time, but adding in rehab exercises such as band pull aparts, face-pulls, and lying down side raises helped significantly. Also, I worked on getting my form better, and learned the cue of trying to pull the bar apart laterally. This cue helped me greatly to reduce strain on my shoulders and activate my back more to create the back \"shelf\" to bench on. Also I incorporated this upper body stretching routine into my workouts (minus the controversial sleeper stretch) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgxr6xAB5ZM. \n\nFor squat, switching from high to low bar helped me push through some nagging pains and plateaus. Additionally, figuring out the valsalva maneuver and using a belt helped my form greatly. For lower body days, I always made sure to do stretching routine limber 11 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSSDLDhbacc. \n\nnSuns is a great program and I'd recommend you get on it as soon as you stop making progress with a linear progression scheme. I feel like I wasted a lot of time doing PHUL and the progress just wasn't there comparatively. You can learn more about nSuns here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nSuns/. I did the 5-day variant since I like the dedicated overhead press day, but any format should work fine. \n\n\nDO NOT DIRTY BULK OR YOU'LL LOOK AND FEEL BAD (https://i.imgur.com/eR8mvuR.jpg)\n\nDRINK A TON OF WATER. I probably drink close to a gallon of water daily. It just makes you feel better overall. Your muscles are mostly water so it'll also help with strength. \n\n\nBE CONSISTENT WITH BOTH DIET AND EXERCISE. Skipping a day or even a week isn't the end of the world, but if you have the spare time, go to the gym. Having a huge meal or drinking with friends on occasion is totally fine as long as you're sticking to the diet the other 90% of the time. \n\nSTRETCH AND FOAM ROLL. Mobility creep is real and you have to adapt.  I mention which stretches I do in the previous part about shoulder problems and lower body work. \n\nGET A FOOD SCALE AND TRACK WHAT YOU CAN. Keep a mental record of things you ate and add the calories up in your head or just in your phone calculator app. This is a relatively hassle-free way of tracking your daily intake. \n\nGYM IS THE EASIEST GAME. In League or Overwatch you lose rank sometimes if you play badly or your team sucks. In gym, you will always gain elo regardless of how shitty you do that day. The only way to demote in gym is with ranked decay, but this can easily be circumvented by playing ~3 games a week. \n\n\n\n##DIET AND SUPPLEMENTS DURING LEAN BULK (~last 3 months):     \nMy diet during this bulk wasn't anything too special, though I always made sure to keep high protein intake (at least 120g a day). My typical daily meal is a chipotle bowl with double chicken, 4 slices of bread with peanut butter, 2 bowls of cereal + milk, and filler food to meet the rest of my caloric goals (usually fruits or eggs). I also took several daily supplements, including 5g creatine, 3g fish oil (EPA+DPA), 5000 IU vitamin D, 3g Beta Alanine, and a multivitamin. I often mixed and used my own preworkout following the instructions from this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/377g6n/why_i_make_my_own_preworkout_and_you_should_too/.\n\n##BEST IN SLOT EQUIPS: \n\nOf course lifting gear won't make or break your progress, but certain items really help when grinding for that next highest ilvl. This could just be all placebo, but hey, anything that helps helps. I suggest you only use them on heavier loads though, since relying too much on them could hinder the development of the smaller muscles involved. \n\nOlympic lifting shoes (I wear adipowers) are great if you're looking to get more depth out of your squat. They also allow me to squat very narrow which I find is stronger for me. \n\nKnee sleeves also add a bit of spring to your squat and help slightly with knee valgus. I found that SBDs were superior to rehbands in this regard after trying both. Knee sleeves also double as shin pads when doing conventional deadlift. \n\nThe Belt is perhaps more useful than both of these. Most gyms will have these at the front desk if you just ask, so learn how to use it! The belt combined with proper valsalva maneuver helped me overcome some form problems and back pains when pushing for heavy deadlifts and squats. \n\nWrist Wraps are useful for ensuring your wrist stays straight on heavy benches if your wrists are particularly small like mine. I just use a 10 dollar pair from amazon. \n\nChalk is great for bench and deadlift if you have clammy hands like me. \n\nWrist Straps are useful for grip limited exercises such as power shrugs, rack pulls, and possibly front squat if your mobility is lacking. \n\nPreworkout is not neccessary, but something I find very useful. If I feel lethargic or unmotivated that day, taking preworkout will force me to use the energy in the gym. It also helps me push for new PRs which are sometimes quite scary (especially squat). If you're gonna raid you gotta bring flasks. \n\nFoam roller is last but certainly not least. I believe this is an essential item to have and using it to properly stretch will benefit you greatly. Mobility and strength go hand in hand. Consistently foam rolling and stretching will not only make your lifts safer, but also stronger. A lacrosse ball can also be considered for more intense pinpoint rolling for some real problem spots such as hip flexors. \n\n\n\n\n##LIFTING STATS PROGRESSION:\n\nMay 2015    \nbodyweight: 115 lbs    \nlifts: nonexistant\n\nJuly 2016    \nbodyweight: 145 lbs    \nBench: 145 5x3    \nSquat: 235 5x3    \nDeadlift: 235 5x3    \nOH Press: 85 5x3    \n\nNovember 2017    \nbodyweight: 138 lbs    \nBench: 225x3    \nSquat: 315x3    \nDeadlift: 335x4    \nOH Press: 135x2    \n\nOn a side-note I've been curious about getting into powerlifting but have no idea what good numbers would be.

I weigh 142lbs\n\n\nStarting out was pretty rough for me. For any extremely small or generally unfit person the weight floor is pretty intimidating. I had a fairly unexperienced friend teach me a little about dumbbells and form. I had just graduated from the soft and vaguely moist cradle of machines to the wide world of freeweights. \n\nThough I had a few moves and a semi-decent routine in my pocket, I still knew almost nothing about diet. Being an obsessive neurotic I chose a 6 day split. The intense training and my tiny, 1500 calorie diet meant that the only progress I made was from the testosterone naturally carving out my body. \n\nDiet:\nEventually I figured out what a proper diet meant and I started making decent gains. The feeling of going from not being able to lift a 45 pound plate onto the leg press to benching my bodyweight is indescribable. Even with my knowhow my anxiety would often get the better of me, and my weight fluctuated from 136-125 frequently. That might not seem like a lot, but on such a small frame 10 pounds makes a big difference.\n\n\nMy lowest weight was in march at 123 after I got top surgery. I started a 3200 calorie/day bulk  supplemented with creatine. I gained about 20 pounds in 3 or 4 months. \n\n\nUnfortunately I started (and am continuing to have) problems with severe untreatable acid reflux (kill me) so I fear that my progress may plateau again.\n\n\nLifts:\n\nBench: 2*165\n\nDeadlift: 1*275\n\nSquat: 1*225 (though after having knee problems I've replaced normal back squat with front squats supplemented by the leg press for that round ass)\n\nEDIT: I was temporarily removed by the mods, but I'm back baby. \nEDIT 2: I mistyped my deadlift.

From our last post, we quickly stalled with that homemade program. We switched to N-suns 5/3/1 and that gave us a TON of progress. We modified it on preference and eventually, we came up with [our program. It\u2019s designed so we try to increase our working max every two weeks, as well as training in a variety of rep ranges.](https://imgur.com/a/CxItL) If anything on it is unclear, please let us know and we'd be happy to clarify!\n\n---\n\nDiet: IIFYM. We try to get a minimum of 200 grams of protein a day (as opposed to 140 like last time). Even though people recommend 0.5-1g of protein per pound of bodyweight, we feel like our progress has significantly improved by sticking to the 200 grams of protein, ESPECIALLY during our cut. \n\nDuring cuts, we eat at around 2200, which was 2 lbs a week deficit (during the summer, we walk A LOT as we have no car, and the gym is 3.5 miles one way. During the school-year, our TDEEs are closer to 2900-3000). We're doing our first bulk in a long time, and our first long bulk. Right now we're eating 3500-3700 everyday and it seems to be going well. \n\n---\n\nCompeting:\n\nWe competed in our first powerlifting meet on July 8th. Austin got first place in teens and 5th in the lightweight division overall. Justin got 2nd place in teens and 7th overall, and [beat the teen Georgia State Deadlift Record with a 227.5 kg deadlift]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKyidZ0bh-I&feature=youtu.be). Not going to clog this post with this but go to [this link if you want to read more about it (and feel free to comment on it as well!)]( https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/6mawin/meet_report_5_bar_showdown_525_kg_681_kg_404/)\n\n---\n\nThought to end this post with 5 points that we wish we knew before we started lifting\n\n1.\tGet on a program! We just did random 5x5 workouts at first and while we made some amazing progress, getting on nsuns made everything SKYROCKET. Our modifications was after running it for a bit to fit our preferences, but the bottom line is that if you\u2019ve never lifted before, follow something from someone who knows what they are doing will be your best bet\n\n2.\tPROTEIN! We had to cut at a significant rate for our powerlifting competition (2-2.5lbs a week). We went from 163lbs to 150lbs  and 154lbs to 143 (including water cut) in a month Our bench digressed by 5 lbs but our other lifts both improved by at least 10 lbs. We STRONGLY attribute that to keeping our intensity as high as we could manage while mitigating the risk for injury as well as having a LOT of protein (200 grams eating <2000 calories)\n\n\n3.\tDon\u2019t assume a cut means you\u2019ll lose strength. Sorta add on to the previous point but we were terrified that we would lose strength for our competition but as we previous stated, most of our lifts went up during our drastic deficit and water cut\n\n4.\tCount your calories! We mentioned this during our last post but we think counting your calories is absolutely vital for success. Unless you\u2019re eating the same meal-prepped foods every day, knowing what you put in your body is invaluable\n\n\n5.\tConsistency. It won\u2019t happen overnight. Some days you\u2019ll be bloated and look terrible. Some days you look great. Some days you just don\u2019t want to go to the gym. Honestly, just push through it. Making going to the gym a habit (or whatever your chosen physical activity) will make the whole process smoother\n\nEdit: Becuase we have a lot of skepticism, yes we are completely natural. The biggest proof we have is when [we were drug tested for our powerlifting competition](http://i.imgur.com/YePwfu2.jpg). We have never and don't plan to ever hop on steroids. \n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Been consistently going to the gym for the last 1 year.

You  have to keep doing it consistently. You will feel rubbish at the beginning, struggling to breathe & will continue to feel so for a few weeks. But by your fifth or sixth week, you will feel far better.  Understand that the real victory comes on the crappy Thursday evening after a long day at work, when you could give up, but instead you make yourself go for a swim instead. Sure, you can swim half what you usually do. I'll bet you that once you actually go swimming, you'll start to feel better, and do more. A year of crappy Thursday nights though, when all added together, will wipe the memory of each and every one of them away.\n\nSkill and talent at swimming are less essential than consistency and work. Those older swimmers who seem to swim so effortlessly? That's not because of a talent or special training you didn't get, *it's because they keep swimming*.\n\n2 **Swim three times a week**\n\nAt least. People ask us this question. We give them this answer. They don't like the answer.  They give up because it's too much. Self-perpetuating problem. \n\nHere's the real story: Three times a week isn't that much since swimming is technically difficult. I usually say the minimum required is four times a week. But if you are getting started, commit to three days a week, of at least 45 minutes per time.\nLook, let's be honest here. Swimming is technically difficult to become proficient at. If your only goal is some weight loss, eat less, go for a walk every day. That will work. If you would like to do those *and* develop a skill that will last you the rest of your life, you need to start swimming regularly. Swimming will  become part of your life, and for that to happen, you will have to fall a little in love with it, with the fluid expression of grace in the water, or the sound of your exhalation underwater,  or the meditative aspect of developing skill and mastery. \n\n*Triathletes*: I still telling you people at least four times a week, and I've heard all your excuses.\n\n3 **Get a proper swimsuit and goggles**\n\nIf you let something as simple as wearing a tight swimsuit be a constraint to keeping swimming, stop now, and let's not waste any more time. Anything loose causes drag,  which will make your swimming harder, and make you less likely to improve. Wearing baggy suits or board short is NOT like running with weights, it will not benefit endurance or strength. It will simply make your swimming worse.\n\nWe've seen more almost naked people of every shape that most people who aren't a paid professional of some kind. No-one cares what I or you look like.  I understand you might be a bit self-conscious or shy. That's your first challenge. Over-come that, fake it until you don't care, and you are on your way.\n\nAnd don't even think about being a regular swimmer without goggles. They are the [most important invention in the history of swimming](https://loneswimmer.com/2013/07/01/the-history-of-swimming-goggles/), including any of the modern strokes. Edit: Since none of the apparel companies or even many swimmers understand the differences in goggles I wrote an article a few years ago explaining [the main different types of goggles and how to choose among them](https://loneswimmer.com/2015/02/04/how-to-understand-and-choose-between-the-different-types-of-swimming-googles/).\n\n4 **Don't eat (an hour) before swimming**\n\nIt's an old wife's tale about eating an hour before swimming will cause cramps. What it will do is start your body digesting food, and making you feel lethargic during your swim as less blood is available for exercise. Also, contrary to what almost everyone you know will tell you, you do not need to eat before exercise. If you have a normal diet, you are carrying about two and half thousand calories in glycogen in your blood and liver. That's enough for **TWO HOURS** of intensive exercise. Endurance swimmers like myself and other endurance athletes actually rely on this ability to perform at their sport.\n\n5 **Don't eat immediately after swimming**\n\nThe single most important reason that swimming is often poor for weight control is that since water is colder (even a heated pool) than body temperature, it stimulates an increase in metabolism in an attempt to increase core temperature. This drives an increase in appetite and people eating too much. You are not hungry from the exercise of swimming (for beginners), you are hungry from *thermogenesis*, the internal metabolic production of heat. Teach yourself to ignore it. maybe drink some milk at the start untiul you are used to it.\n\n6 **Breathe out underwater**\n\nIf swimming has a secret, it's this. You have no idea [how many times we get asked on Swimmit about breathing difficulties](https://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/search?q=breathing&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all). A common  phrase I hear is \"I'm a good swimmer, I just have difficulty with the breathing\", whereas those two are mutually exclusive. One simple search will provide thousands of instances of this question (Please, people, is using the search box so difficult?). Exhale with your face underwater. Try and do it in a controlled fashion rather than a sudden explosive breath. Keep doing that.\n\nHere's an actual trick to help: Hum. If you hum while your face is underwater it will help control your breathing and exhalation. \n\n7 **Get some technique advice**\n\nYou'll notice how little of the above has to do with actually swimming. This bit is about swimming. If you are the kind of person who can stay at something because it's difficult to master, swimming is perfect for you. I could say get lessons, but all you really need is someone who knows about swimming technique (a good swimmer, maybe a lifeguard, maybe not) to look at what you are doing, and then make changes according to what they tell you. You cannot figure this out for yourself. I am always happy to help someone who might ask. Other experienced swimmers are the same, because we all got here the same way, with the help of others watching us, telling us what we are doing wrong.Lessons or coaching are great, but I don't like spending your money for you, and you can improve this way.\nYou improve by finding out what part most needs to get better, then doing drills to correct that. Beginners hate drills because they feel slow and often unproductive. So they don't do drills. Which is why some people can actually swim for 10 (or in the case of one guy in my pool|) 20 years, and never improve. \n\nHere are a couple of the best drills for front crawl (aka freestyle). I'm not involved in any of these videos, I simply did a YouTube search\n\n1. [Side drills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RqScQWpko). Slow, boring, but the most important drill of all. These help with balance, rotation and the all-important breathing. You start this with your arms by your side or one extended in front. Do a couple of lengths of each. Then start to add a rotation and one arm pull . Eventually move to doing a rotation and pull every 12 kick strokes\n\n2. [Raise your legs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIH7mS-GHUo). Wall kicks are really good. Legs too low in the water are the second biggest problem after inability to breathe. The main causes are lifting your head too much, poor ankle flexibility and bicycle kicking from your knees instead of hips. I'm going to give you another easy tip: Clench your butt cheeks together.  This will reduce your ability to kick your lower legs, and will start to raise your body to be more horizontal.\n\n3. [Fist drill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul3yH2tzwAU). This is a stable of most experienced swimmers' toolbox. It's difficult, frustrating, slow, feels horrible ...and immensely valuable. Swim some lengths of front crawl with your hands in fists instead of open, then go back to swimming normally. It will have all kinds of positive effects, mainly you will start to use your forearms for propulsion which will improve your position, and reduce drag. (Yes, you will be fisting the water).\n\n\nThere are hundred of drills covering all aspects of your stroke. Try to spend the first ten minutes of every swim doing these above, and add/substitute some more depending on what feedback you have on your stroke.  \n\n8 **Understand lane etiquette**\n\n[Following basic lane etiquette](https://loneswimmer.com/2011/02/15/lane-swimming-etiquette/) is the swimming equivalent of putting the weight backs on the racks and wiping down the bench after you use it or putting the flag back in the little hole, or so I understand from Fittit. (*I don't even lift, bro*). Swimmers like other swimmers. If you understand and follow etiquette, which lifeguards and pool management don't in general understand, you can swim in a lane with people of differing speeds and do so comfortably for everyone.\n\n9 **Use the clock**\n\nA very common mistake for new swimmers is mixing up  shortness of breath with exertion. People take rests that are far too long. The primary [use of the pace clock for new swimmers](https://loneswimmer.com/2015/05/13/how-to-an-introduction-to-the-pace-clock-for-beginner-improving-swimmers/) in most pools is not purely to time fast swims but to ensure you are swimming on a consistent interval. So you can use it to time your rests. For most people for most swims, rest shouldn't be longer than 30 seconds, and better to only take 20.\n\n10 **Warming up is more important & difficult than you realise**\n\nUnlike the way say movies portray effort, humans require a period of increasing physical load to enable our hearts to beat faster and provide more oxygen to sustain more effort. The warming up phase has us feeling sluggish and unfit, until our hearts can beat enough to provide the necessary oxygen. Once warmed up, you will swim harder, faster and better. Don't make the mistake of thinking that how you feel in the first five or ten minutes is all your are capable of, which is a very common mistake that often stops people not familiar with physical exercise. Warming up is difficult in water for people struggling with breathing.\n\n******************\n\nBTW, have fun.

Armed without the faintest of idea on nutrition, I lost about 40lbs in 2 years by eating less but not healthily. My diet consisted of enough alcohol to float a boat (Uni. Don\u2019t judge) enough coffee to tide me over until it were an acceptable time to drink (1pm. incase you\u2019re wondering) and one solid meal a day because I was usually too lazy and too hungover to stomach much. I don\u2019t advice this at all, obviously. \n\n\n\nAfter finishing uni, I spent the summer feeling sick and run down so I bought a bunch of books on nutrition and eventually decided to go vegan. The transition into vegan was bumpy to begin with as i didn't ease into it, but instead threw myself into the deep end. I spent the first few weeks bewildered at what exactly I could eat that was of substance. So I ordered a few cookbooks and learnt to put together meals. These are some of the cookbooks I recommend for those that are interested:\n\n- Easy Vegan by Ryland Peters & Small\n\n- Vegan Feats by Rose Elliot\n\n- Honestly Healthy by Natasha Corrett\n\n- Harumi\u2019s Japanese Cooking\n\n- Skinny Bitch by Kim Barnouin\n\n- Sweet vegan (for dessert recipes)\n\n\nAs requested, some tips for those looking to keep it as inexpensive as possible:\n\n- Beans, nuts, legumes, rice and grains are fantastic staples and also very cheap to buy. Buy in bulk if that\u2019s available to you.\n\n- Local ethnic shops tend to sell the aforementioned staples for a lot less than chain supermarkets so pay them a visit and support a local business at the same time.\n\n- Forgo the supermarkets in favor of farmers markets or weekend market stalls. Depending on where you live and what\u2019s available, this can shave off over 2/3rds from your weekly fruit and veg shop. \n\n- Frozen vegetable are just as good as fresh so stock up\n\n\n\nSince then I have dropped the remaining 30lbs and built a decent amount of muscle. I\u2019m very lucky not to have been left with any loose skin. Probably because I lost the weight over a long period of time and that I moisturize religiously, drink a ton of water and also my age.  Inner thighs and back of arms still feel a bit squidgy but overall nothing too noticeable. \n\n\n**Diet**\nI keep an 80/20 balance. 80% healthy and 20% indulgent. A sample of my daily intake looks something like this:\n\nBreakfast: Big bowl of fruit along with granola and almond milk.\n\nSnack: handful of almonds and walnuts\n\nLunch: Salad consisting of black beans, salad leaves, butternut squash, pumpkin seeds and a splash of avocado oil and lemon juice\n\nSnack:  banana\n\nDinner: Vegetable stir fry. \n\nDessert: dark chocolate. \n\nI like to keep it as natural as possible and I\u2019m not a fan of soy products because protein on a vegan diet is pretty easy to get with some proper planning. I total at about 2500 calories because I workout 6 days a week and I\u2019m fairly active outside of work. \n\n\nAlcohol: I obviously don\u2019t drink nearly as much as I used to because I\u2019m a grownup laydeee and stuff. Nowadays, it\u2019s no more than 5 drinks a week and yes, along with the occasional blowout, I\u2019m not gonna lie (once a month, if that)\n\n**Drinks**: 3litres of water daily, one americano in the morning, 2 cups of black tea and 2-3 cups of green tea throughout the day. No energy drinks or fizzy drinks. \n\n\n**Macros**:  C45- F20-P35 I stay as close to this as possible. After a couple of years of fiddling with the ratio (with 80/10/10 being the worst by far) this is what works for me. \n\n\n**Supplements**: I avoid vegan protein powders (soy, pea etc.) because they taste like ass and I\u2019ve yet to find one that I can tolerate.  I only take a daily Vitamin D tablet (5000IU) in the autumn and winter and a weekly b12 (25ug). I get annual bloods done and everything is within the healthy range. \n\n\n\n**Exercise**\nWhen I went vegan, I also took up running, which was great and I loved it but soon noticed that it wasn\u2019t really doing anything to change the shape of my body but instead was just shrinking it and so for a long time I had that skinny-fat look. Eventually, I incorporated boxing and pilates and that definitely helped to strengthen my core and give me a bit more definition. \n\nReal change didn\u2019t start to happen until 6 months ago. One of the trainers at my gym has the most incredible butt, mid-forties and in better shape than 99% of people my age. So after months of just ogling her arse like a creep, I asked her what the hell it is she does to get such a glorious behind and she introduced me to the area of the gym I\u2019d avoided like the plague: yes, the weights. Since then, I\u2019ve been doing a mix of bodyweight exercises (pushups, situps, planks, dips, donkey kicks) and weight exercises (squats, deadlifts, lunges, glute bridges, kettlebell swings, Russian twists, overhead press, curls) \n\nI do my weight and bodyweight workouts 6 days a week, alternating lower and upper body days (Monday: upper, Tuesday: lower, Wednesday: upper etc.) along with either a boxing class, a 3-5 mile run or a yoga class. \n\nLike everyone else, it\u2019s still a work in progress and I\u2019m working towards lifting heavier weights. \n\n\n\n\n**TL;DR** Before: fat & drunk. After: smaller and sometimes drunk.\n\n----------------------\n\n**Edit 1**: added a lot more info and thank you guys for all your lovely words! However, do stop pm'ing for webcam shows.

I tried to come back to play senior year but I sucked and lost my starting position. Eventually I stopped sports and tried to focus on my studies.

I gained an insane amount of weight but kind of just shrugged it off as w.e (kinda got somewhat depressed etc...) \n\n\n\n**The start of changing**\nEventually I got accepted into a nursing program and slowly made a few small life style changes. However my big epiphany moment was during my second semester (happened to be because of a girl lol). I just started to go run and completely changed my diet. Losing 40 lbs in a three month period. Eventually I kept doing my thing but unfortunately failed out of school (shit is rough yo). Really got depressed and contemplated hurting myself, but i never went through with it. I just kept doing only cardio to de-stress.\n\n\n**Start of lifting**\nWhen i first started to lose weight all i did was cardio and diet. Eventually I came across /r/Fitness where i was encouraged to start lifting weights. I started to do SL 5x5, but I was super weak from what I used to lift during my football days. However my muscles somewhat recovered and within about two months i was lifting a fairly decent amount again (feelsgoodman).\n\n\n**Current Diet**\nIve basically been on a cut for 2.5 years. For the first year i never really tracked caloric intake, but i eventually stalled out and became more diligent with my calories. Im currently doing a 40/40/20 macro split with 1700 calories per day (I wanted rock hard abs and an Adonis belt lol)\n\n\n**Current lifting stats/personal records**\nI'm currently doing a PPL routine with added in cardio/abs day interspersed between days when I'm not at work or at school (currently in another nursing program) which can be found here.

However, I spent much of my 20s and all my 30s not going to the gym. During those days if I was talking about six plates it was likely a reference to the last Chinese or Indian buffet I visited. \n\nI was a college football player (small school, DIII), so I had a decent frame underneath all the weight I gained during almost 20 years of sedentary life. Even still, that first trip back to the gym was humbling. I struggled doing pushups. My knees gave out when I did lunges. My squat form was shit (I blame my old coaches, but they were teaching me what was the norm back then). \n\nPlenty of times I felt like stopping, this is stupid, you're not as young as you used to be, your body can't do this anymore, etc, etc, etc. But I kept after it. Eventually, my knees stopped hurting, and pushups got easier, and I started to build strength. I had a few setbacks, a herniated disc in my neck put me out of commission for much of last year. But I kept going back, and once I got the all clear from the doctor, I was fully back at the gym, working my way back up the ladder. \n\nYesterday, when working on my one rep max, I finally got back up to 3 plates on each side of the bar. Something I hadn't seen since my junior year in college. It felt good to push that weight up, and to see the younger guys at the gym give a side eye glance at me and the bar after I racked it. Yes, I saw you looking. And I grinned.\n\nMy routine wasn't anything spectacular. Just strong lifts 5x5 to start and then modifying to a 4 day split. I'm there maybe 45 minutes total, so it's not a major time commitment. \n\nOlder guys, younger guys, gals, people, basically if you're healthy, it's never too late to get back to the gym.

Midnight pizza deliveries still happened, just on rare occasions.\n\n**3rd EDIT**\n\nApparently (some) of you guys think my routine defies the laws of time and space.\n\nI go to the gym on my lunch hour at work. I get an hour for lunch, but I'm salary so if I get back in 1:05 or 1:10 it's not that big of a deal. It's a five minute drive to and from the gym, plus time to change and shower. I really only do 90 to 2 minutes of rest between sets, and I occasionally will superset lifts (abs and pulldowns for example) so I'm not standing around too long. I never have to wait for equipment because no one is there at lunch.  \n\nWhen I say it takes me 45 minutes, that's the time I'm in the gym, it doesn't include drive, change, shower.

Really, anything to keep my heart rate up and sustained.\n\nAll in all, the time spend in the gym is around 30-45 minutes, so I really don\u2019t spend a lot of my time in the gym. I really attribute most of my results to the diet.\n\n**Diet:**\n\nGoal caloric intake \u2013 1,800 cals/day, but I usually get around 1,400 to 1,600.\n\nMacro goals \u2013 150+g protein, under 160g carbs, under 60g fat.\n\nTo achieve this, I have been following more or less the same formula\n\n* Breakfast \u2013 \u00bd cup oats with a banana\n* Lunch \u2013 Lean Cuisine (usually chicken-based ones)\n* Snacks \u2013 Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein (2 scoops), Apples, Oranges, Pears, etc\n* Dinner \u2013 Flexible, just as long as it fits my macros (This gives me the freedom to eat Pizza, McDonalds, or whatever I want really)\n* Pre bed snack \u2013 1 can of Tuna (or 2, if my protein was lacking during the day)\n\n**Supplements:**\n\n* Protein \u2013 Optimum Nutrition Whey (2 scoops) daily\n* Creatine \u2013 Six Star 100% Creatine Monohydrate (5g) daily\n* Multivitamin \u2013 CVS brand One-a-Day Men\u2019s Health Multivitamin (1 pill) daily\n* PreWorkout \u2013 C4 Sport Blue Raspberry (1 scoop) only on lifting days", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "My 3 month transformation after sobering up and working out in a small gym with primarily dumbbells.

Ever since I started 6th grade I was very insecure about my weight and the way that I looked.  I always thought that maybe I would just grow into my body and get better looking when I got older.  That was not the case.  After my first semester of college I was extremely depressed, my father had passed away about a half a year before that and I noticed I was laying in bed a lot wallowing in my own self pity.  I was morbidly obese, I was convinced that I would be alone forever and all I could do was lay in bed and go to school.  I finally got the motivation and courage to ask my mother if she would be willing to get YMCA passes for the family so I could start losing weight.  For a while me and my whole family were going to the gym.  Soon, everyone else gave up but I kept going.  I LOVED IT.  Both cardio and working out, the feeling that I got afterwards was amazing, it was like being high but better.  I've been going to the gym since January 20th of 2016, I remember the date because it was the time I started to really turn things around in my life.  I've never felt better and I plan on continuing to better myself.  My final goal weight is 180 pounds but my current goal is 220 and I'm almost there.  Then it will be 210, 200, 190, 180.  This subreddit is something that got me going too and I wanted to show you lovely bastards what you did.  Thank you.\n\nI started off doing SL 5X5 but after about three months of that I moved on to a lot of different workout routines that I can't remember off the top of my head but the most recent one I've started is PPL.\n\nOn Mondays and Thursdays:\n\n\nTriceps, Shoulders and Chest\n\n\nOn Tuesdays and Fridays:\n\n\nBiceps, Traps and Back\n\n\nOn Wednesdays and Saturdays:\n\n\nLEGS\n\n\n\nI also do about 30 minutes of cardio everyday.  At least 10 minutes of running on a treadmill, never less than that and the rest of the time I do cardio on a bike.  When I first started out tho I did 30 minutes of nothing but an elliptical, I thought it was a way of bitching out of running on a treadmill at first but I found it to be very effective.  By the end of the first 2 weeks I had lost 14 pounds.  \n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone, it means so much to me that you all left these kind words.  I recently have started feeling more and more confident in myself and this just solidifies my confidence even further.  I wanna become the best version of myself and I plan on doing it with you guys.  I'll update as I progress further.  \n\nA lot of people have also been asking about my diet.  I have no real extensive diet plan, all I try to do is eat a decent amount of vegetables with a decent amount of high protein meat like chicken and I was going at about 1500 calories at first but had to increase the calories during the spring of 2016 because of plateaus that I kept hitting.  But when the weight is coming off I try to stick to about 1500 calories a day consisting of pretty much veggies and meat, no real specifics there and I'm sorry for that but it's not something I plan too much considering I am pretty busy most of the time and have no time to prepare my own food as I have work, school and the gym to attend.  Sorry, I know when I first started losing weight I would come here to find out good dieting techniques but to tell the truth the thing that works best for me is basically eat less food, also cut out soda entirely as well as sugar and other junk food.  Good snack foods are things like almonds and walnuts and other nuts like that.  I pretty much never eat breakfast anymore because I have to wake up early enough for my classes.  That's pretty much it though.  Thank you all so much for the kind words.  It feels amazing for people to call me an inspiration to them.  There is truly no feeling like it that I have experienced.

I carried probably 80% of my extra fat on my stomach, 10% on my upper arms, and the remaining 10% throughout the rest of my body.  I really hate my old photos but it's nice to have them for comparison!\n\n[Summarized progress, the first photos I took and the most recent photos side by side.](http://i.imgur.com/nDwipkv.jpg) \n\n[Detailed progress, with dates and weights.](http://i.imgur.com/Qea01ZG.png)  \n\nSince I only started lifting halfway into my diet, it's interesting to see how lifting started changing my body!\n\n**CURRENT MEASUREMENTS:** Waist, 27\" - Hips, 34\"\n\n**CURRENT LIFTS:** Squat, 105 lbs - Bench, 95 lbs - OHP, 55 lbs - One armed rows, 30 lbs - Deadlifts ended at 135 lbs\n\n___________\n\nA year ago, just after Valentine's day, I decided to get into shape.  This was with a caring, gentle, loving nudge from my boyfriend (it's not an easy conversation so props and *thank you* to him).  I had been feeling gross and insecure about my body for a few months at that point but was in denial, so hearing it from him was the push I needed to get my head out from under the sand!  I'd like to add I was about 135 lbs when we started dating in 2010, so this was a slow increase in weight.\n\nI started my lifestyle change right away.  My biggest problem was that my portions were too big, my TDEE is about 1800 cals and I was eating the same portions as my boyfriend who's TDEE is ~2700.  \n\nI cut my calories to 1200 but ate pretty much whatever I wanted as long as I budgeted for it, and it worked.  I guess I was technically doing IF with a 16/8 cycle but that was just coincidental since I've never been a big breakfast eater anyways.  I was also doing Couch to 5k at the same time but had to stop after a few weeks because of an old ankle problem that came up again.  So I just dieted for a couple of months.  I'd also like to note that I avoided the scale and taking photos like the plague for the first month... it felt like too much pressure.  But I know from a prior Dr's appointment that I was sitting around 157 lbs the beginning of 2014.  \n\nOnce I was close to dipping below 130, I started going to the gym and doing SS 5x5, 3 days a week.  Because of this, I increased my calories to 1,500 a day.  I still ate whatever I wanted, and would drink protein after workouts.  I did not count the protein towards my calories.  \n\nThe lifts really changed the way my body looked.  I never had much of a separation between my lower back and my butt but it's emerging now!  And I went from thinking I looked good at 126 in August to comparing that to me at 126 now and thinking I looked kind of fat!  It's pretty crazy.  \n\nI know my squat seems pretty low, but that's because I've been dealing with IT band pain that required me to drop weight and increase really slowly.  Back in November I was squatting 135 lbs.  I've stepped away from deadlifts while I get my squat back up because the issue in my legs is probably acute compartment syndrome and I can reduce the inflammation by not using my legs too much (and I like squats more than DL).  \n\nAfter the new year I dropped my calories back down to 1300.  I've got 2-3 lbs of fat that I'd like to lose.  1300 isn't a hard limit for me either... I try to stick to it most of the time but if I want/need to I'll eat more as long as I don't pass 1800!  It's been two months of the 1300 calories and I'm definitely seeing some fat loss between the January pics and the photos I took today!  \n\n____\n\n**MY ADVICE FOR OTHERS:**  \n\n**Be committed and give yourself rewards for hitting milestones.**  By giving yourself a reason other than \"I want to look good\", you'll be less likely to slip.  I waited until I'd lost the 1st 10 lbs to get a haircut I really wanted.  I got to buy myself new dresses after my old ones were too big.  Then I decided I wanted to do a really good Mystique cosplay and could absolutely not be out of shape for it, and that gave me another goal to work towards!  [Bonus photo of the result, this was August 30th, 126lbs.  I tried to drop water weight for 5 days prior.](http://i.imgur.com/zDS2Vzz.jpg)\n\n**Tell as few people as possible about your goals.**  I only told my boyfriend, my best friend, and my mom in the beginning.  It wasn't until I was *very* close to my end goal that I told anyone else.  This was because I wanted to avoid comments like \"What, you look fine you don't need to diet!\" or \"Oh come on, you can have *one*.\"  And when my friends asked my why I wasn't drinking anything at parties, I'd just say I was taking medication that didn't let me drink, which brings me to... \n\n**Cut out alcohol.**  Seriously.  I didn't drink from February 2014 to September 2014.  I did the math for my deficit and it just wasn't worth it.  On some days when I had 150 cals left after dinner I might have had a beer or a glass of wine, but I almost always opted for a candy bar instead. Mmmm chocolate!  The bonus now is that my tolerance is pretty low haha.  \n\n**Don't subtract calories from exercise** (unless you do something that burns shittons of calories).  First of all, the calories estimates for exercise in MFP are *wayyyyy* off.  They are way too generous.  I've seen it tell people that walking 2 miles burned 450 calories.  People complain that they diet and exercise but don't lose weight... well if you are counting exercise towards your diet and use MFP for that, I'm not surprised!  Second of all, I'm of the opinion that if you're trying to lose weight, why run 3 miles and then eat those extra 300 calories?  You could be losing weight by keeping that deficit.  As long as you're eating at least the minimum your body needs, you don't *have* to replenished those calories burned through exercise.  \n\nHowever, I'd like to reiterate that if you do some exercise that burns tons of calories (like intense swimming), you should probably eat those back!  But if you're doing those exercises you're probably in excellent shape and not trying to lose weight either :p  \n_______________\n\nThanks so much for reading!

A YouTuber did a 90-day transformation challenge. I took it up. These are my results.\n\n------\n\n**Starting weight:** 153.8lbs\n**Dumbbell bench press (starting lift):** 12kg (on each arm) for 8 reps.\n**Bench press (starting lift):** Just the bar with 2.5kg plates on.\n**Squat (starting lift):** Smith machine bar for 8 reps.\n\n**Ending weight:** 149.2lbs\n**Dumbbell bench press (ending lift):** 30kg (on each arm) for 8reps.\n**Bench press (ending lift):** The bar with two 25kg plates on (I think it comes to around 70kg total with the bar).\n**Squat (starting lift):** 40kg Smith machine for 8 reps.\n\n------\n\nMy journey consisted of a 60-day bulk and then a 30-day cut. So I'll break these up below.\n\n* First 60-days.\nMy maintenance level was around 2400 calories so I bulked for the full 60 days eating around 3000 calories a day.\nI struggled to hit my target goal everyday (since I wasn't used to eating so much) so I'd have a lot of smoothies that consisted of *peanut butter, blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, banana and a mix of yoghurt or water with protein powder*.\nI did the PPL split I found on this subreddit and followed that religiously without changing anything up.\nI hit the gym 6 days a week and on the 7th day, I'd just hit whatever wasn't hurting.\n**My end bulk weight was 158.8lbs**\n\n* Last 30-days\nThis is where I had learnt the most from reading through this subreddit, Googling and as a result changed things up a bit.\nI began my cut. I spent the first few weeks at 1850 calories but I was drinking a lot of Dr Pepper to fill my hunger *(not understanding you count calories in drinks thus I wasn't losing a lot)*. So I cut the drinks out and dropped to 1600 calories a day and began losing weight.\nI mixed my PPL up. Since my chest was lagging. I'd hit my chest close to three times a week *(if I felt like I could - if not I'd just do another body part)*.\nI started to superset everything with core work. So I'd do my lifts then immediately go onto some hanging leg raises or something then give myself 30second rest. I did this because of the lack of cardio in my routine and I wanted to cut quicker (I found cutting weight a lot harder than gaining it).\nSo 6 days a week consisting of a PPL while super-setting every set with core work. On the 7th day, I'd do some very light cardio. Walking on a treadmill at a 10% incline at a speed of 5 for 30minutes usually resulted in me burning around 300 calories.\n**My end cut weight was 149.2lbs**\n\n------\n\n*Things that helped me/I learnt along the way:*\n\n* Super-setting everything with core work made my workout a lot more fun and intense.\n* Next time, leave more time to cut. First time cutting so didn't realise how hard it was to lose weight.\n* Go every day no matter what and make a routine out of it. Many times I'd get in late from work, around 11 pm. I'd get into the gym for 11:45 pm and leave around 1 am. But I made sure every single day I went to the gym no matter how tired I was the next day. Now, I was on holiday for the past week and all I could think about was the gym lel\n* Googling a lot, read a lot and ask questions on this subreddit. I learnt so much from doing just that.\n* Once a week on each body group I'd lift the heaviest I could for 4 reps. I'd up this by the next weight possible each week. Really helped me feel a better sense of accomplishment.\n* Be nice and genuine to people in the gym. Since I was a noob and all I was always apologetic and polite when asking people stuff in the gym whether it's questions or just asking for a machine. A few times people have just asked do I want to workout with them and they've ended up really pushing my limits which were nice (I usually workout alone).\n\n------\n\nI know it's not the best transformation ever. \nBut I feel a lot better. My sleep has improved massively.\nI have more energy. I just all round feel a lot better about myself.\n\n**Advice**\nMy single advice would be to go every single day to form a habit. Regardless of what you work on just get in the gym every day and once you're more comfortable in the gym then you can start worrying about what's what.\n\n------\n\nI hope a few people try this 90-day challenge thing. It really is amazing!\n\n------\n**EDIT**\n\n* I seen someone ask and figured I'd update the post.\nHere's some pictures of the workout PPL I followed for 60-days.

Nick E here!\n\nFollowing some demand from this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/flexibility/comments/4rskz0/is_there_a_list_of_exercises_to_test_mobility_so/d543zvq\nI decided to start up on a project for making a guide that makes it so anyone could easily spend 15-20 minutes assessing themselves and get a good idea of where their mobility is lacking, or if they have any imbalances.\n\nI figured it might be appropriate to share here as in fitness its important to have balanced mobility to avoid injury.\n\n#LINK HERE: http://www.nick-e.com/mobility-assessment/\n\n##Summary:##\n\nNot going to list all the tests and assessments on here as they are better explained in the article with pictures and whatnot, but here's a list of all the articulations tested:\n\n* Shoulder Flexion\n\n* Shoulder Extension\n\n* External Shoulder Rotation\n\n* Internal Shoulder Rotation \n\n* Wrist Flexion/Extension\n\n* Finger Flexion/Extension\n\n* Internal Hip Rotation\n\n* External Hip Rotation\n\n* Hip Abduction\n\n* Hip Extension\n\n* Straight Leg Hip Flexion (Pike)\n\n* Bent Leg Hip Flexion (Squat)\n\n* Ankle Dorsiflexion\n\nFor each articulation I propose a test, explain the pass/fail, and propose possible causes of the failure, in terms of particular muscles being tight or weak.\n\nI would explain in more detail to summarise, but its hard to do so without literally writing out the entire article, which would take up lots of space and wouldn't be nearly as helpful without the pictures haha.\n\n**OTHER STUFF**\n\nThis is just kinda step 1 of this project. I wanted to get this out cos this was just the most explicitly demanded aspect. In future I'm going to add a section that directs you to resources that directly address each of the issues listed, so once you identify a problem, you can immediately go about formulating a solution to it!

It summarizes my story :D)\n\nInstagram (2016) : @angryeric / www.instagram.com/angryeric\nhttp://imgur.com/a/MAs4d\n\nA little backstory to this transformation...\n\nI've never been that super athletic guy, I always spent countless hours playing video games. When I graduated from high school, I lost nearly all contact with any friends I had from there. I sat in my house playing games for 8-10  hours a day. I was failing at school and quite honestly, I didn't care. I didn't really care about anything, there was no meaning to my life at the time. I was looking at myself every day in the mirror, seeing that I was deteriorating, but once again, I didn't really know what to do.\n\nAll my self confidence I once had, all my friends I used to have, all my good grades, they'd all disappeared. I was looking through some family pictures (2012-2014) and I could just see the spark I had diminishing progressively. On August 15th 2014, I decided it was time to make a change.\n\nI got in contact with a good friend of mine and straight up asked him to take me under his wing (he'd been training for nearly 3 years). He gladly agreed and on August 22nd, I took my first pictures. I'll be listing what I changed, how I changed it, my stats and everything after the pictures.\n\nStarting Weight : 210 lbs, 5'11\n\nAugust 22nd http://imgur.com/a/MAs4d#0 (210 lbs)\n\nYou can just see the look on my face here, it was one of the first times in a long time that I'd actually dared take off my shirt in front of anyone (my mother & friend took the picture here). \n\nSeptember 17th http://imgur.com/a/MAs4d#1 (~195 lbs)\n\nProgress was already being seen, I'd lost about 20 pounds since the start in this picture. Surprisingly enough, it wasn't too difficult to lose these pounds, I just changed some habits (will explain in detail below)\n\nOctober 22nd http://imgur.com/a/MAs4d#2 (~185 lbs)\n\nI was down ~15 pounds since the start and was finally starting to re-gain some self confidence. I was much happier and I think the look on my face proves it (compared to the first picture!)\n\nNovember 19th http://imgur.com/a/MAs4d#3 (~180 lbs)\n\nAt this point, was diet was on pretty much on point, I was doing cardio frequently on my treadmill & I was also lifting quite often (explained below)\n\nDecember 22nd http://imgur.com/a/MAs4d#4 (~176 lbs)\n\nDecember was a huge change for me, I was no longer lifting and doing all this because I wanted to get in shape, I was doing it because I enjoyed it, I loved it. I broke down when looking back at the pictures and the progress. I wondered what I would be right now if I hadn't started all of this. This went from being a small short-term goal to a hobby, a passion. \n\nThe gym is now a place where I go to let go, there's nowhere I enjoy being more than the gym. It's like my playground.\n\nNow, lets talk about what I changed, how I changed it, my lifts, my frequency, my intensity, etc.\n\nDIET & CARDIO\n\nOn August 15th, I started out by cutting out all forms of junk food (soda, chips, fast food) and started drinking 3L of water daily. When I got hungry, I'd make sure to drink some water and when I was actually hungry (I used to eat out of boredom, so keeping myself occupied was another thing I started doing as well!) I'd snack on green vegetables. Pretty boring, I know, but it worked.\n\nI also made sure to eat tons of meat/fish, I was eating ~180g of protein a day and I was trying to keep my carbohydrates down, I'd only have carbs ~1-2 hours before working out and ~1-2 hours after.\n\nMy cardio schedule was three days a week, I'd do 15-25 minutes on my treadmill at a reasonable speed, I just wanted to control my breathing and sweat as much as I could.\n\nLIFTING, STATS & PROGRAM\n\nI started going to the gym five times a week right off the bat. I was so motivated, was resting a lot and was eating reasonably so I wasn't getting tired.\n\nHere were my starting stats (AUG 22ND) (sets x reps x weight)\n\nSQUAT : 4 x 12 x 95 lbs\nBENCH : 4 x 12 x 75 lbs\nDEADLIFT : 4 X 12 X 75\n\nHere are my ending stats (DECEMBER 22ND) (sets x reps x weight)\n\nSQUAT : 4 x 12 x 185 lbs\nBENCH : 4 x 12 x 155 lbs\nDEADLIFT : 4 x 12 x 225 LBS\n\nROUTINE\n\nI didn't just stick to one routine, I've switched it up quite a few in the last 4 months but they're all pretty similar when it comes down to it. I was on a 5 day brosplit (ehehehehe :D)\n\nDay 1 (Chest/Triceps)\n\nDB Fly 4 x 12\nIncline Bench Press 4 x 12\nChest Press 4 x 12\nPec-Deck 4 x 12\n\nPush-down 4 x 12\nOverhead Extension 4 x 12\n\nDay 2 (Back/Biceps)\n\nDeadlift 4 x 12\nClose-grip Pull downs 4 x 12\nSeated Cable Rows 4 x 12\nOne Arm Dumbbell 4 x 12\n\nDumbbell Curls 4 x 12\nHammer Curls 4 x 12\n\nDay 3 (Shoulders)\n\nShoulder Press 4 x 12\nSide Raises DB 4 x 12\nSide Raises Machine 4 x 12\nReverse Pec-deck 4 x 12\nBent Over Lateral Raises 4 x 12\nFront Raises 4 x 12\n\nDay 4 (Legs)\n\nSquats 4 x 12\nLeg Extension 4 x 12\nLeg Press 4 x 12\nLunges 4 x 12\nSeated Leg Curl 4 x 12\nLying Leg Curl 4 x 12\n\nDay 5 (Arms)\n\nBarbell Curl 4 x 12\nPreacher Curl Machine 4 x 12\nIncline Hammer Curl 4 x 12\nHigh Cable Curl 4 x 12\n\nPush Downs 4 x 12\nSkullcrushers 4 x 12\nDips 4 x 12\nOverhead Extension 4 x 12\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThat about concludes my post, hopefully I inspired you to make a change in your life, I sure know I made a change in mine. I've also started a fitness channel with my friend but I don't think I'm allowed to post it here due to self-promotion rules, but I posted my transformation video on /r/videos and I'm more than glad to answer any questions you have, just reply to the thread or message me /u/nefitt\n\n HAPPY NEW YEAR!\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "[Progress] My 4 Month Transformation, 19 year old male.

I decided that it was time for some drastic life changes, so I joined a gym and started counting calories. \n\n\nBefore and after: [caption](http://imgur.com/RuUZCIc.jpg)\n\nFace before and after: [caption](http://imgur.com/bEpapsG.jpg)\n\n\nSome details: \n\n\nI started going to the gym three times per week, doing upper body one day, legs another and mostly cardio the third. I tried to go on hour long walks two times per week aswell in addition to the gym, just to get used to moving around. \n\n\nAt the beginning I started small. Lifting light and just focusing on the basic muscle groups, with help from my dear friend the internet. When 3-4 weeks had passed I added some weight and just kept at it like that. \n\n\nOn the days I did upper body I would mostly use barbells for every muscle group, doing 10 reps in three sets each. Leg day I mostly used machines, the same amount of reps and sets. \n\n\nWhen I was doing cardio I started with 30 mins on the treadmill, 5.5km/h with a slight slant and then 15 mins on the eliptical. Nothing fancy, just something to get my heartrate up. \n\n\nAfter a while I upped my game to 6km/h and 20 mins on the eliptical and after about four months I did HIIT (high intensity interval training) for 15 mins at the end of every gym session. That really did wonders for my stamina and metabolism! I usually did HIIT on the eliptical, starting with 20 sec active, 20 sec rest and then cut the resting time to 15 and then 10. \n\n\nWhen summer came along I started cheating, skipping gym sessions and started falling back to my old habits so in august this year I signed up for sessions with a personal trainer and dietist, just to get things moving again. \n\n\nIn this program I did a VLCD diet the first four weeks. I lost about 20lbs. On mondays and wednesdays I do circuit with my PT and on fridays and saturdays I do my own circuit and cardio. In between that I also walk/jog and do pilates at home. \n\n\nMy week now: \n\nMonday: Circuit with my PT. It varies greatly but it focuses mostly on strength and getting your heartrate way up. \n\nTuesday: Walk/jog 60mins\n\nWednesday: Circuit with my trainer\n\nThursday: Pilates at home 50mins and Tabata 10mins as warm up. \n\nFriday: Upper body circuit and HIIT \n\nSaturday: Legs and abs circuit and HIIT \n\nSunday: Rest \n\n\nDiet:\n\nI started using myfitnesspal, set my calorie goal at 1800 and made sure that my macros where okey everyday. My macro goals were 40% protein, 25% carbs, 35% fat. \n\n\nI cut out sugar, white bread and white pasta from my diet and only splurged on \"bad food\" on special occasions. I kept my portions small and never took seconds.\n\n\nI ate three meals a day to begin with, now I eat five. \n\n\nNormal day at the beginning: \n\nBreakfast: High protein, non sugar, low fat yoghurt with blueberries and a hardboiled egg.\nCoffe with non fat milk\n\n\nLunch: Waterbased salad, some high fiber vegetables and chicken/fish\n\n\nDinner: waterbased salad, high fiber vegetables, potatoes/brown rice etc. And some meat product. \n\n\nNormal day now:\nBreakfast example: hard bread, low fat cream cheese, low fat ham, bell pepper, cucumber and two eggs\n\n\nLunch example: tuna salad with beans and eggs\n\n\nDinner example: low fat ground beef, tzatziki, oven baked potatoes and veggies, waterbased salad on the side\n\n\nSnacks: carrots, apples, high protein yoghurt, berries etc two times a day. \n\n\nI base my meals on the following model: \n\nOne hand waterbased veggies\n\nOne fist of high fiber carbs/veggies\n\nOne fist of protein\n\nOne thumb of fat \n\n\nOn saturdays I get to eat what I want. Often it's going out to a restaurant, or party or something like that. It works great if you can go back to normal the next day. \n\n\nI also do guided meditation three times per week, to help with stress and focusing on my goals. \n\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this, and if you have any questions feel free to ask!", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "F/31/5'10 From 254lbs to 165lbs in 14 months.", "post_ups": 4435, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5cvnj2/f31510_from_254lbs_to_165lbs_in_14_months/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:10.321708", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Rippetoe", "post_created_utc": 1441727407.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "3k3uf6", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 643, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 4390, "post_selftext": "Short Bio: I\u2019m the author of *Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training,* which is now available as an interactive mobile app, allowing for quick reference checks and logging your training; *Practical Programming for Strength Training*; *Strong Enough?*; *Mean Ol' Mr. Gravity*; and numerous journal, magazine and internet articles. \n\nI\u2019ve worked in the fitness industry since 1978 and have been the owner of the Wichita Falls Athletic Club since 1984. \n\nIn 1983, I graduated from Midwestern State University with a Bachelor of Science in geology and a minor in anthropology.

My weight before the cut was 227 lbs and right now I'm weighing around 161 lbs (I'm 5'10\" btw) Here are the pics:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/2fPbe\n\nMy biggest takeaway is to never try dirty bulking. At the end of the day, you do pack on a fair bit of muscle, but you WILL have to cut for very extended periods of time. I would honestly suggest that lean bulking and gaining 1-2lbs a month tops would be the best strategy and to also not start bulking until you're at least under 15% bodyfat.\n\nAs for muscle loss, I probably did lose a bit of muscle. My arms went from 16 inches to just below 14.5 and I lost a lot of the fullness I had before (although it's probably more to do with muscle glycogen and water). I'm a lot happier now and will probably reverse diet for five weeks before transitioning into a lean bulk.\n\n**Workout**\n\nJust a basic PPL split six days a week.  This would consist of the big four lifts (squat, deadlifts, bench and OHP) as well as isolation work for shoulders, arms and traps.  The main point of working out was to retain muscle and strength throughout the cut.  My strength actually increased during the initial months of the cut but has recently started to drop off due to the length of my caloric deficit.

For a while now I've been considering doing the same, but I had been terrified of doing so. As most are when they used to be incredibly overweight, I'm self-conscious when it comes to my body image. I used to be an overweight slob, which was brought on by binge eating because of my depression during my teen years, and which I still deal with today. Back then, I would eat to the point until I felt my heart begin to tighten in my chest, and while it was terrifying, there was a part of me that wished to go. \n\nAlbum: http://imgur.com/gallery/Jkvbn (sorry, I'm new to Reddit!)  \n\nI started to turn things around when my grandmother passed away. I cut out all the sweets, sodas, and juices. My body went through a massive withdrawal phase, but I bit down and marched through it. I didn't have money for a gym at the time, but there was a nearby track that I could reach nearby. It was there where I started to walk and barely jog for a few seconds. Eventually, those few seconds before a minute and then a few minutes. That jog became a gradual run. That run became the 6-10 miles I would run every day. I started to add some body weight exercises to my runs too, but mostly I prided myself in my endurance and was content to keep it that way. At that point, I weighed at my lightest of 135 lbs. \n\nUnfortunately, despite being able to see my abs finally, I had to deal with quite a bit of loose skin around my waist. It was a constant reminder of how I had messed up. That I had gone too far. There was a part of me that wanted to give up. I started to ramp up my exercises, but to no avail. I couldn't rebound from it.              \n\nAround this time my father became ill with cancer, and between school helping to take care of him, I started to taper off from working out as often. Then he passed on July 31st of 2013. Unsure of what to do, I found peace in lifting. My older brother introduced me to power lifting, and finding some Youtubers online definitely helped guide me along. However, it was slow going for someone that barely had any strength; going from a mindset of run, run, run to lifting primarily. I loved it though.\n\nDuring this time I found better work and started to save, having started to research what I could do with my extra skin. Traveling for some consultations took time, but it was worth it in the end when I found a surgeon that not only cared but had a great portfolio.\n\nI was terrified of the surgery, as it was my first ever, but I went in figuring that anything was better than what I had. Coming out of it, I was in no pain at all. Lifting had helped to tighten my  abdominals, so I didn't need to have them reset (which is where the majority of the pain comes from). I now have a 360 degree scar around my waist, and it took me roughly 2 and a half weeks to walk around normally, instead of the hunch back I had to be. The surgery took place in late February of this year, and I can share more pictures of this if you guys want.\n\nAnyway, now here I am at 160, in the middle of a cut. While I still deal with depression, I'm much happier, and slowly trying to get used to the idea of intimacy (I have a lot of stretch marks, so I'm crazy self-conscious about it). As for why I decided to post this all, it's because I know that there may be others out there like me. I want them to know that it's not impossible to turn things around. That it's not too late to have a better, healthy life. If there's at least one person out there that turns it around because of this, then I am happy.\n\nEDIT: to add a TL;DR -- I was fat, battled depression, but hustled through it.

Looking to lean out to about 15%, so advice would be appreciated!\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/Gr6go\n\nI'm about 5'2, 14 in the first photo and 16 in all the others. \nI became overweight around age 10 and got steadily bigger from there. At the end of middle school I developed depression for a multitude of reasons, but one of the results of this was a bout with anorexia. The actual weight loss took only about 3-4 months because of that. Since then I've been attempting to heal by maintaining a healthy diet and building up some muscle, but every once in a while have periods where eating will become a problem for me again. I currently eat around 1300 calories a day to maintain my weight (I have a very slow metabolism).\n\nEdit: apparently I have to include my diet and routines!\n\nAs I mentioned previously, the initial weight loss was a result of an eating disorder, so I don't have much advice on that. However, I can tell you about what I do to maintain it now.\n\nWith my diet I'm very strict. My macros usually end up around 35% protein, 30% fat, and 35% carbs. I do follow a pescetarian diet, which leads me to eat some pretty crazy stuff to get all that protein without most meat. Egg whites, salmon, whey protein, and tuna are pretty frequent. If I had to recommend some specifics, Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard whey is great in any flavor and Mission1 Protein bars are amazing. I eat around 1300 calories a day, as mentioned earlier, and am constantly carb cycling. 35% carbs for 2 days, 50-55% for 1, repeat. I wouldn't recommend this diet to everyone, as it is affected by aforementioned eating disorder.\n\n2 times a week, I do legs. The first day is sets of 3x5 reps of the heaviest weight I can manage (for all exercises). These include squats (currently doing around 115 pounds, I lost a lot of muscle when I lost weight), leg press, prone leg curl, leg extension, abductor and adductor. For cardio I sometimes throw in 15-20 minutes on the stairs.\nI generally don't do full days dedicated to arms/chest/back because I already get a decent workout while doing archery training, but when I do I only use machines, almost never free weights. I use the shoulder press, chest press, lat pulldown, bicep curl, tricep extension, chinups and dips. These are all with 5 sets of 10-12 reps, about 10 pounds below the maximum of what I can do. On these days I eat less carbs, but I'm not sure that makes any difference.\nAt the beginning AND end of each workout, I do 10 minutes of 30sec HIIT sprints with 30sec walks in between. This has been probably the biggest factor in getting my body fat down when I was stuck around 23%. \nIt's hard to me to think of everything I do off the top of my head so feel free to send me a message if you have a question!\n\n\nEdit 2: I get it, you think I look fine now.

I didn't gain as much as you might think, I mostly made what I had more visible. \n\n[Before & After Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/MjkXl)\n\n[Here is a picture](http://imgur.com/w0hVy9w) of how jacked I already was my senior year of HS before I gained weight to prove that I had a solid muscular base and really didn't gain much muscle. \n\n**The Spring Break Trip:**\n\nRoughly one year ago, I was invited to a spring break trip to Panama City Beach, FL. I had a great time... BUT... I felt held back... I really started to see just how bad my lack of confidence was; I wanted to take my shirt off and enjoy the sun, but I really didn't want people to see how I looked. Coincidentally, during the trip, I found [this article](http://www.wisdomination.com/screw-motivation-what-you-need-is-discipline/) by /u/zbyhnev/ which outlined the difference between motivation and discipline. \n\nThe article mentioned: \n\n> This is one of these situations where adopting a different perspective immediately results in superior outcomes. \n\nIt really was. Immediately when I got back, I told myself that I was going to lose weight and get ripped for my next spring break trip. I didn\u2019t care what it took. I wanted it so I was going to have it.\n\n**The Plan:**\n\nI knew the basic idea behind losing weight was to eat less than you could consume, so I went off of that idea. I looked up a weight loss calculator on google and stumbled upon [this one](https://www.fitwatch.com/calculator/weight-loss-target-date). I plugged in my stats to lose two pounds a week and got my caloric target: 1880.\n\n**The Beginning:**\n\nIn the beginning, I really didn\u2019t workout or anything, I just tracked my calories. At some point I started using [myfitnesspal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) to track my calories but I did it on paper to start off. I ate what I was used to eating, just less. I ate portioned out tuna casseroles, bagels with cream cheese, noodles with pasta sauce and a whole bunch of other typical \"American\" food. I lost a decent bit of fat just by doing that and I felt great because I was gaining solid momentum. At a certain point, I made a bet on a site called [healthywage](https://www.healthywage.com/) which pays you to lose weight. I knew confidently that I was going to follow through so it was a no-brainer. Needless to say, I doubled my money.\n\n**Gaining Momentum:**\n\nWhile losing weight, I did lots of research and learned a lot. I read a lot of articles and watched a lot of fitness YouTubers. I think it's important to be a sponge for information. Learning while going through the process was crucial in getting the results I attained. I was learning about re-feed days, strict body-building diets, supplementing creatine, advanced calorie counting techniques and weighing food on a scale before I did any of those things. A couple of months into my journey, I finally joined the gym. \n\n**Hitting the Gym:**\n\n(Note: I lifted before I got fat so I had some sense in what I was doing when I started)\n\nYouTubers I liked at the time were the [Buff Dudes](https://www.youtube.com/user/buffdudes) so I modeled my workouts after their [3-day split routine](http://www.buffdudes.net/2014/04/3-day-workout-split-routine.html). Later, I read about the concepts behind the [Strong Lifts 5x5 program](http://stronglifts.com/) and combined that with the concept of a three day split. Here's the kicker: I didn't really have a set list of exercises that I would do in a certain order when I went to the gym, I would always wing it...\n\nThese are the only rules I really followed when entering the gym:\n\n* Get around 5 reps on most compound exercises\n* Focus only on the particular body parts for the given day. (Chest+Triceps, Back+Biceps, Legs+Shoulders)\n* Focus most of my effort on compound exercises\n\nFor chest+tricep days, I would do flat dumbbell chest presses and the good ol' fashioned bench press for many sets of 5 reps. Sometimes I would do things like incline barbell presses and incline dumbbell presses, etc. As soon as I noticed I was repeating the same routine multiple times, I switched it up. I would change the ordering of each exercise, the number of sets, the amount of weight along with shorter/longer rest periods, incorporation of drop sets, etc. There was one day where all I did was bench press for 20 sets and kept dropping the weight until 135 became unbearable. I feel that it is too easy to get bored with the same routine so I mixed it up. I enjoy the process of choosing what to do in the moment given what equipment is available and what I'm feeling. Needless to say, I confused the hell out of muscles doing this. (Which is a good thing!)\n\nI got addicted to going to the gym. I loved feeling the pump where my muscles would fill with blood, feel tight and look huge. Since I was cutting for a while though, I gained very little strength which was slightly discouraging. However, there was a point in time where I started to supplement with creatine (5g daily) and felt like a gym god in about 2-3 weeks. My deadlift went from 275 to 315 and I remember being so happy when I finally pulled 3 plates.\n\nI'll also add that I did some running on the treadmill about 2 times a week for 15-20 minutes after my lifting sessions. As you can see, extreme cardio was not a significant part of my weight loss. A caloric deficit with some weight-lifting and persistence was the key.\n\n**Improving my Diet:**\n\nAs I kept reading and watching YouTube videos, I learned better ways to eat and prepare food. First of all, I only drank water, plain tea or black coffee (drinking only water/coffee/tea was never a problem for me but I know it is for others so I thought I'd mention it). I learned techniques for preparing my meals ahead of time and routinely eating those (/r/mealprepsunday). I planned the meals to be anywhere from 500-700 calories. They tended to consist of a lean meat, a filling carbohydrate and steamed vegetables. I also ate plain oatmeal for breakfast with some chopped up fruit and/or peanutbutter and cinnamon. I also drank fruit smoothies and prepared overnight oats. By now, I had purchased a food scale and a body fat caliper to chart changes in my body fat percentage and measure my calories with greater precision. I started eating very clean. I did have days where I would have slices of pizza and other junk, but I stuck with my diet 99% of the time.\n\nProteins: Chicken Breast, Turkey, Fish\n\nCarbohydrates: Brown rice, Quinoa, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes\n\nVegetables: Broccoli, Carrots, Cauliflower, Green Beans\n\n**Getting Ripped:**\n\nLosing fat became very hard at the end. My fat loss started to plateau. My goal was to get to 10% body fat and at the time I had around 14-15%. Previously, I had read about re-feed days and diet breaks and decided to give these techniques a try. I figured my body needed it considering that I had been at a caloric deficit for many months. The 14-day diet break I had was amazing. Energy levels went through the roof which translated to slightly better lifts in the gym. After the break was over, I lost a couple more pounds of fat a little bit easier.\n\nWith the iconic spring break trip soon approaching, I had to lose another 5 pounds in about 6 weeks. I slightly lowered my calories from around 2000 to 1800 and continued to hit the gym 3 days a week with occasional cardio. It was very difficult. I had ridiculous cravings. RIDICULOUS. I started obsessing about the next time I was going to eat and my roommate had to deal with my shitty mood swings. I had about two planned re-feed days within that 6 week period and those were the days I looked forward too. In the end, it came down to discipline in not eating and sticking to my plan regardless of how I felt. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe day before spring break, I had a new average weigh-in: 175lb on the dot.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nI was fat and didn't like it. learned discipline > motivation.

Then in college the gym became my stress relief, the place I would go to get away from the stresses of work, finals, whatever.  I made great friends there, and always enjoyed the various associations I made there.  That was until I got married in September, 2015.  I'd still go to the gym once or twice a week, mostly by myself and sometimes with my wife, but most, if not all of my healthy habits started to diminished very quickly.  Over the course of 2016, my marriage started to crumble and became very toxic.  I was the most unhealthy I had ever been in my entire life, in every category.  I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't eating right, I started to struggle at work, I was emotionally fragile, and spiritually shattered.  It was obvious to everyone but me.  I eventually came to see what was happening, and decided that enough was enough.  I filed for divorce in September, and it was finalized on December 22.\n\n**Plan** \nI figured that since I had 90 days to basically wait in limbo while everything was processed by the courts, I would take this time and try and get as big and strong as I could, basically just to give me something to do and work towards.  Here are the [results](https://imgur.com/gallery/DA6x1).  I didn't do anything crazy, but followed the advanced part of [this routine](http://www.myprotein.com/thezone/training/push-pull-legs-routine-best-mass-building-workout-split/) almost to the letter.  I'd never done a PPL routine before.  I really liked it!\n\nI didn't do a very good job of counting calories or macros.. But on an average day I'd eat around 3000 calories.  \nBreakfast\n*oatmeal and a banana\nLunch\n*was completely random each day, as I eat out most of the time... \nDinner\n*Almost everyday was 2 chicken breasts, 3 golden potatoes and a protein shake.\n\n**Gains**\nMy starting weight was 180 and my weight at the time of the pictures was 193.  My peak weight was 196.5.  I've since been sick for about 2 weeks and have settled back to about 185..   I've never tried to do a bulk before, so I really didn't know what kind of results to expect, so I'm not sure if this is good or not, but I feel great!  I plan on getting more serious about the nutrition side of things as I go forward, because I know it's important.\n\nI wish I had done a better job of documenting my starting lifts..  Since I hadn't really lifted seriously for at least a year, I think that accounts for why I gained as much strength as I did.  I probably awakened a lot of the strength I used to have too.  I remember going into do flat bench and struggling to put up 185.  Last week I did 3 reps of 265!  Most I've ever done.   \n\nThe  biggest gains by far were in my self esteem and confidence.  Getting out of an unhealthy situation and putting myself into a healthy one.  I am much more confident now.  I smile more.  I laugh.  And I sleep better than I have in a long time.  I'm happy with myself again.  Don't ever settle.  Especially if you're in a shitty situation.  Thanks r/fitness for all your help!\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "I filed for divorce in September and dedicated my 90 day waiting period to getting as big and strong as I could.

All of the information on here has been great but seeing people help others by posting has given me the courage to do the same. \n\nThere are really two stories within this post. For most of my life I have been over 200 pounds. I actually just found some old pictures (mainly what made me feel the need to post for others who might be scared) where I was my heaviest. [THESE](http://imgur.com/a/Lbwvy) are from my trip to San Fran in 2007 and [THESE](http://imgur.com/a/KGpTl) are from 2011. Don't really know what weight Im at but I'm guessing around 200 as I had logged it in MyFitnessPal that year. I had horrible eating habits and was mostly eating once or twice a day due to stress and having a horrible schedule of 2 jobs and school. I tried for a little bit to log my food but never stuck to it. Over the next few years my weight would go up and down but when I started working out last year I was 185:\n\n**AUGUST** [185](http://imgur.com/a/mfGOc) I really have no explanation as to why I started working out. I think it was just a challenge to myself, or just get rid of extra energy but once I started I never (and still haven't) stopped. I logged my food and weight on MyFitnessPal from day one but of course fell into the trap of it telling me what my goals should be so my goal was 1200 calories a day and I started walking on the treadmill for about an hour a day 6 days a week.  I religiously weigh and track my food. I had always loved healthy food so it wasn't a huge transition for me and going to culinary school helped me create healthy meals. I didn't have any clue about my macros for the first few months so all I did was focus on just eating 1200 calories. From looking back in MyFitnessPal I could tell that my carbs were super high and was most likely the reason I could run and walk as much as I did.  \n\n**SEPTEMBER** [171](http://imgur.com/a/sEhk5) Started doing faster walking on the treadmill and incorporated WII dancing as well into my 6 days. I had a full time job with odd hours so I would workout at different times but still made it a habit to get on that treadmill for at least 45 minutes Saturday through Thursday.  \n\n**OCTOBER** [159](http://imgur.com/a/mhoSr) [09.30.14 **161**](http://imgur.com/hYtLPcm) )I eventually wanted to see if I could actually run on the treadmill and slowly started increasing my speed. I sort of set a goal to get to 145 and was well on my way. [10.27.14 **154**](http://imgur.com/3mAYjqf)  \n\n**NOVEMBER** [150 Halloween](http://imgur.com/S5AMCDE) Unfortunately I didn't keep up with the monthly progress pics but took enough bathroom pictures to keep track lol. Mid November I hit my goal of 145 but of course I wasn't happy and set a new goal of getting to 135 by Christmas. By then I was well immersed in the fitness subreddit and was addicted to finding out as much info as I could. I told myself that if I could get to 135 I would start lifting weights and ease up on the cardio.   \n\n**DECEMBER**  Don't have any pictures of November through December but at this point I'm running every day for half of the workout time. By Christmas I had hit my goal of 135 and had already begun researching what I wanted to do in the form of lifting. Of course with all the success I had been having with cardio I didn't want to get rid of it entirely so I did a bit of it before and after my \"workouts\".  I was still eating only 1200 calories. \n\n**JANUARY-FEBRUARY** [135 01.08.15](http://imgur.com/XtETEFS) I knew from reading more information that eating 1200 calories probably wasn't the best thing to do.  I was going through some emotional things during this month and lost my job so eating was all over the place. I jumped back up to 140 but by the end of January I was back down to 135. Throughout Januray and February I was all over the place with diet as for a whole month I stayed 135--low carb, high carb, low protein, high protein--I was so focused on my weight going down that I just tried everything week to week. I would increase my calories one week and a little bit of weight would come off then come back on. I had no energy on the low carb diet and noticed that for the previous months it had been high and I was still losing weight so I increased them. So beginning of FEB I had [THIS](http://imgur.com/FhzRGXU) as my macros which wasn't working at all since I stalled for a month. So increased the calories even more to: 1450, 163C 40F, 109P. I eventually lost 5 more pounds. I found JEFIT and started doing a small weight lifting routine through it. I only had dumbells and a ProForm home gym so I incorporated some random exercises here and there as I had no idea what I was doing.My treadmill eventually broke so I eventually just had a stationary bike to work with. I was still scared to leave cardio out of the equation as now the weight was coming off more slowly.  I officially hit 130 midway through February and was ecstatic.  [02.12.15](http://imgur.com/QejqBfg,9IYjpCJ) [2.16.15](http://imgur.com/hmebHop)\n\n**MARCH-TODAY** [Hovering around 130]()\nMy weight was/is constantly going up and down a few pounds. I was so used to the weight falling off that I started freaking out and over analyzing **EVERYTHING**. By the end of February the lowest I had gone was 128 but it continues to go up and down. I eventually got rid of all the cardio and started a tighter lifting regime which you can see [here](http://www.jefit.com/2643983). \n\n[THIS](http://imgur.com/a/Kauox) Is me today. Currently 131 and still have some loose skin on my belly. I didn't photoshop any of these pictures as I wanted to show what it looks like to still have stretch marks. \n\nI'm still a work in progress and still learning every day from things you guys post on here, so please keep it up!\n\n**DIET** The first three months was semi-clean eating with lots of chicken, salads and veggies. I still had a cheat day on Fridays (my only off day) where i would eat a little bit over the 1200 calorie limit. Before XMAS I had been reading about the importance of protein intake and with my new lifting mindset I set my goal pretty high (135g due to my weight at the time) and was able to meet it pretty easily since I received a huge bag of whey for xmas. Other than that I filled it in with eggs, chicken, beans and cottage cheese or yogurt. My carbs were either fruit, veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts) or brown rice. I LOVE spinach and still eat at least a bag of it a week. Like I've said I over-analyze everything so I'm still tweaking my macros since I'm focusing on heavier weights now. I love avocados and that is my main fat source other than egg yolks and nuts. I still have pizza every now and then and try to fill my sweet tooths with shakes with sugar free syrups or even protein powder ice cream concoctions. \n\n**ROUTINE**\n**Sunday**: Legs & Abs: Dumbbell walking lunges (3x8 @ 40lbs), leg extensions (3x8 @ 105), glute kickback, lying leg curls, standing calf raises(3x10 @150), smith machine squat (3x8 @ 110), cable one leg kickback (3x8 @ 25), plank, dumbbell side bend (3x8 @ 25).\n**Monday**: Back and Biceps: dumbbell one arm row (3x8 @ 30), dumbbell twisting standing curl(3x8 @ 20), dumbbell hammer curls, dumbbell alternate bicep curl, cable rope seated row(3x9 @70), wide grip lat pulldown(3x10 @60), dumbbell reverse grip incline bench row.\n**Tuesday**: Shoulders & Abs: dumbbell arnold press (3x8 @20), dumbbell front raise(3x8 @ 15), barbell shrug(3x8 @ 140), weight plate front raise(3x10@25), air bike, crunches, weight plate twist(3x30 @ 25), plank, dumbbell see saw press, toe touchers.\n**Wednesday**: Chest & Triceps: bench dip, push up, dumbbell incline fly(3x8 @20), dumbbell tricep kickback (3x10 @20), smith machine bench press (3x8@70), dumbbell one arm tricep extension, butterfly(3x10@50), dumbbell close grip press.\n**Thursday**: Legs & Glutes: Glute kickback, standing calf raises (3x10 @150), single leg curl (3x8 @ 25), smith machine deadlift (3x10 @ 130), smith machine lunge (3x8 @ 110), band good morning, bodyweight lunge.\n**Friday** OFF DAY\n**Saturday** Usually swim, HIIT on the bike, or sometimes extra ab workouts or chest (pushups) as I'm pretty weak in that area. \n\n**SUGGESTIONS/CRITIQUES**I'm still unsure of what to do as far as macros as my weight isn't really moving (and yes I know the number won't change if I'm getting leaner). I need to stop focusing on the number on the scale and look at my body. Posting this has helped me see that but I still love critiques and ANY help with this is welcome. I know all about IIFYM and keep psyching myself out on which is the best way to go since all I'm doing now are weights. Like I've said my weight has been going up and down 1-2 pounds for about a month now so I'm kind of stuck on what to do. I'm currently eating [THIS](http://imgur.com/rngyWL6) to see if increasing my cals again will help me lose fat while lifting. I really want to get rid of my little belly and wondering if you all agree that its just extra skin.\n\n**GOING FORWARD**\nI hope to lower my body fat and work on building some muscle. \nAny critiques on my workout regime are welcome as well. Like i've said I am a work in progress and all your comments are greatly appreciated. Thanks again guys for hearing my rant!\n\nTL;DR: [Before](http://imgur.com/a/mfGOc)...[After](http://imgur.com/a/Kauox) Still a work in progress.\n\n**EDIT**WOW GUYS & GALS!! You are all a real help in keeping my faith in this subreddit. I really hope that I have helped those who said so. To those that thought I looked great before, I thought I did to! I never hated my body just wanted to challenge myself to see what I could do. This definitely isn't my stopping point either. I just wanted to get some insight on a few things and perhaps in the process show those who are stuck that it can be accomplished. I will definitely keep posting.\nI think I'm going to start tinkering with bodyweight fitness as I don't want to teach myself bad habits with the smith machine. I'm hoping someday I can afford a gym membership or a proper rack and be able to start 5x5's.\nAgain, THANK YOU all for your kind words, great tips, detailed replies and reassurance that /r/fitness is always here to help!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "[Progress] Female 26 Years Old 185 to 130 pounds in 6 months.

I have been competing for 5 years and got into powerlifting as an outlet to deal with adversities in life. My goal is to be the youngest person to bench press 600 lbs in competition. I hope to accomplish this goal within the next 6 to 8 months. \n\nHere's the video of the 556 bench: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfk-Qqm4WRk \n\nMy current training protocol is an 8 week bench program that requires two bench days a week (one heavy and one light). The regimen can be compared to a linear progression, where you add 5-10 lbs every week to the heavy day. This program has increased my bench 76 lbs in 9 months, from 480 lbs to 556 lbs. I plan to continue using this program in order to bench press 600 lbs. \n\nA quick summary of the program would be the following: \n* The first week of training starts starts with a heavy day (this day is considered to be a day where the weight being used is more taxing on the body than a typical training day) at 75% of your current 1 rep max (the most weight you can lift for one repetition) for 3 sets of 5 repetitions. \n\n* The first light day (this day is a day where the weight being used is not very taxing on the body and allows you to focus more on the technique of the lift) also starts at 75% of your current 1 rep max for 5 sets of 5 repetitions. As you see, the first week of the program requires both days to use the same weight, but this changes week by week because each week the weight increases (only on the heavy day) by 5-10 lbs (depending on how easy the previous week was). \n\n* Continue this training for 8 weeks. After the 8th week, decrease the weight to 50% of current 1 rep max. The subsquent week, try maxing out. \n\nMy diet: \n\n* my diet is not the healthiest diet, but i make sure to consume at least 120 grams of protein a day by way of protein powder and high protein foods (steak, chicken, fish). sometimes i will allow myself a really big meal such as twelve tacos or a huge plate of cajun french fries. \n\n* the way my school schedule is and training schedule, I am only able to eat twice a day (once after school and once after training) but I make these meals count by eating a sufficient amount of calories to sustain high energy levels. For example, a typical meal before the gym for me would be two grilled chicken sandwiches with a bottle of gatorade or fruit punch. \n\nBenching 556 lbs. was a huge PR for me. But I see it as a milestone. And now a 600 lbs. is the next goal for me to achieve. Currently, the youngest person to bench 600 lbs. in competition is Josh Bryant, the creator of Jailhouse strong. He was 22 years old and 9 months weighing at 306. I have until December, 2017, to beat his record, and I plan on weighing no more than 275 pounds. \n\nThanks for watching my video and reading my post.

We're having a big event at Muscle Beach tomorrow to celebrate, and I wanted to invite all of you. I've always had a great time chiming in here when I have time - I even had the joy of having a couple of you write a Protein Bible (http://www.schwarzenegger.com/fitness/post/the-protein-bible-part-1-introduction) for my site. \n\nSo I wanted to make sure I invited you, because I will be hanging out from 3-4 and signing some copies of the latest Muscle and Fitness while some monsters work out in the pit around me. If you RSVP here I can leave some special Reddit wristbands at a tent for you so we can make sure that I can meet some of you in person. \n\nBut I want to make it really special for somebody.\n\nHere's the deal. Tell a story about fitness - something inspirational, something hilarious. . If you get the most upvotes and you can be at the event, I will save a VIP pass for you. Bring your gym clothes, because you'll be in the pit working out the whole time I'm there. I'll even give you some advices. \n\nLooking forward to seeing you tomorrow.\n\nEDIT: KarmaPoIice was the top comment, so I'll see you there. I loved some of the stories so much I decided to expand it to five of you. I am not completely sure 5 will fit in the weightlifting area with all the people there, but if not, I want to at least take a picture with the five of you I replied to. You had some great stories. \n\nEveryone else: I'm going to leave 75 wristbands designated for Reddit at the MusclePharm tent. They will be first come/first serve.

I'll need your help. I already studied the faqs and searched for posts of other people with morbid obesity in here, but that didn't help me all that much. I am a total noob to fitness (obviously, heh) and am dirt poor, meaning I also do not have access to a gym or any sort of equipment. It's just me and my (admittedly quite voluminous) bodyweight right here. \n\nMy fitness goal is relatively simple: I want to be able to ride horses again and, with my current weight, I should be tried for animal cruelty just thinking of that, yes yes. I used to ride competitively, now I obviously don't anymore. Also, it would be hella nice to not have to strategically plan my day around any flight of stairs in order to not break a sweat like I'm in Zumba class. \n\nSo far, I obviously switched my diet (to IF and low calories), which worked out well but is a topic for another subreddit. I have started swimming (40 x 25m every other day, that's approx. an hour of swimming), but alas feel like I should do something more. My swimming pace is still, um, fairly leisurely (to put it nicely). In the past, I have tried doing workouts at home, but it never feels like... I'm doing it right? I don't really know how to describe it, but everything is either too hard so I'm unable to do the exercises or too easy, so I feel like doing it is useless. Does that make sense? I hope it does.\n\nSo what I am looking for is any sort of advice for people like me - morbidly obese and already collapsing when looking at a flight of stairs. I have tried googling, but basically all websites say \"Don't!\" and order me to go swimming, which I already do. Should I really just leave it at swimming? \nAnd for me, the most important question is: How do I know I'm doing something right? What should a successful work out feel like? Did I not work out properly if I don't have sore muscles? Does it need to hurt? I am really at a loss, but I feel like there's gotta be something more I can do to get healthy. And to me, being fit is the ultimate definition of healthy. \n\n**Edit:** Woah guys! I was out for a second taking a walk (yay me?) and I'm coming back to this! Excuse me while I get my little notebook out to scribble all of your advice down. I have so much love for you right now!\n\n**Edit 2:** I'm reading every single one of your replies. I really am. You guys are amazing. On the bright side, the scale showed 336.4 lbs this morning, which I assume is just natural fluctuation in weight, but I chose to believe otherwise. If you need me, I'll be swimming! \n\n**Edit 3:** In case someone still reads this, as of today, I sit at 320 lbs.

The uninitiated should be informed that this is a prime opportunity for the activation of the gluteus maximus, tibialis anterior, and rectus femoris among others. Stand on trains, get swole.\n\nRoughly a year ago, I was on my commute to work as usual. All the seats were occupied by people either sleeping, reading, or trying to avoid eye contact with those standing in order to avoid the guilt induced by their comparative comfort. A woman, at least 8 months pregnant, waddled on to the train. You could hear the collective brows furrowing as all seated passengers focused more intently on the hideous, MC Hammer inspired carpet weave between their feet. Like the Spartans in Thermopylae, they would hold their ground.\n\nSaid pregnant woman moved in the car, standing some four feet across the aisle from me. Before she could set her feet properly, or grasp a pole for support, the train lurched forward as if shot from a bow. This woman had not been following a balanced split routine, and had approximately 15 lbs of uncentered gainz protruding from her. She began to tip backwards on her heels like a tree being felled. In a flash of divine inspiration, I sprang into action. Reaching for the rail hanging from the ceiling, I wrapped my fingers tightly around it. No time to chalk up. I orangutaned across the car, stretching my left arm behind her. Dumbbell isolation had insured it was equal to the task.\n\nShe and unborn child landed on my forearm. With a slow controlled release, I allowed my arm to extend completely underneath her weight, softening her fall and achieving full ROM. As I curled her body upwards, we locked eyes. I knew in that moment she loved me. She gazed at me with the fire I reserve for my protein shaker and an open power rack. As I slowly righted her, she mouthed, \"Thank you.\" Bicep Charles whispered back, \"No, thank you.\" \n\nAn abashed man relinquished his seat, which she took in an instant. We never spoke another word to each other.

It was a typical bodybuilding regimen: back squats, leg presses, leg extensions, bench presses, shoulder presses, lat pulldowns, and cable rows. Each workout, they did three sets of eight to twelve reps of each exercise, lifting to failure.\n\nThe only difference between the two groups: One rested for one minute between sets, and the other rested for three minutes.\n\nAfter eight weeks, the researchers used ultrasound imaging to measure the lifters\u2019 muscle growth. The men who had rested longer had more growth in all the muscles tested: the biceps, triceps, and quads. We\u2019re not talking about monster gains: The longer-resting group grew an extra 1.2 to 3.5 millimeters in each muscle. But those millimeters come from such an easy tweak that few guys who are trying to bulk would turn them down.\n\nThe researchers also tested the subjects\u2019 strength gains by determining their one-rep max in the bench press and back squat. The longer resters won this contest, too. They increased their one-rep max for the squat by 15.2 percent and for the bench by 12.7 percent. That\u2019s compared to the one-minute rest group, which increased its maxes by 7.6 percent and 4.1 percent, respectively. That\u2019s big: If you can bench 180 pounds, a lifting regimen with longer rests could help you increase that to 203 pounds in eight weeks. Resting for only 1 minute between sets, on the other hand, could hold you back to only 187 pounds.\n\nWhy the difference? The researchers think that a longer rest period allows you to recover more fully between sets, which may enable you to lift heavier weights in your next set, says lead study author Brad Schoenfeld, Ph.D. Those heavier weights put more tension on your muscles, which may lead to bigger gains in both strength and size. Consider working longer rests into your routine if you want to build strength and size, says Schoenfeld.\n\nThis study only compared one-minute and three-minute rests, but other research suggests that two minutes may be enough to fully recover between sets, he says. Take those two-minute rests after your major compound exercises like squats, presses, and rows, which are more physically taxing and take longer to recover from. But you can stick to shorter, 60-second rests for single-joint movements like biceps curls, which you\u2019ll bounce back from more quickly.\n\nText from this article from Men's Health (by Ali Eaves): http://www.menshealth.com/fitness/how-long-rest-between-sets", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Resting longer between sets could help you build bigger, stronger muscles, according to recent research in The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research", "post_ups": 4226, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/49e66z/resting_longer_between_sets_could_help_you_build/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:10.322704", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "techsin101", "post_created_utc": 1466193989.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "4ol45h", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 215, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 4204, "post_selftext": "I'd love to have comprehensive list of gifs even if animated that show every single exercise and how it's done.

From elementary school on, I was pudgy and it only got worse. In high school/college, I was heavier, but still at a manageable weight. It seems I have the metabolism of a sloth. I tried going to a nutritionist in college and it was actually a very awful experience, I tried a liquid diet, nothing worked. Eventually got married to someone who was more unhealthy than myself and I clocked in at 368 lbs. \n\nJanuary 1, 2012, I decided I wanted to lose weight. I thought it would make my marriage better so we did it together and by December 31, I had lost 100+ lbs. The first 8 months, I just ate healthy and calorie restricted. Then I incorporated walking and got a personal trainer who came to my house and did strength training. At this point, my ex husband decided he no longer wanted to \u201ckeep trying to lose weight.\u201d I felt so good, I decided that I was doing it for me, not my marriage, and powered on. \n\nI never had a goal weight initially, just to lose some weight. It never occurred to me that I wouldn\u2019t always be plus size so when I could shop at regular stores, I was so excited and kept going. By mid-2013, I was weighing in around 200 lbs and set a goal of weighing 150 lbs by my 30th birthday (December 2013). I got in to spin classes and other group workouts and they really helped me reach my goals. \n\nI hit 150 (218 lbs lost) early December. Went to Vegas to celebrate said birthday and honestly have never weighed 150 since. It was an unhealthy goal for me. I put some weight back on and off and gained quite a bit of muscle and now bounce between 175-185. I have a bit of skin to deal with and will always be a thicker girl, but I\u2019m mostly happy with it all now. \n\nHow did I do it? Meticulously counting calories. Cut out 95% of alcohol for the first 1.5 years. No specific other dietary restrictions and built in calories for chocolate, etc. when I had a sweet tooth. I did track everything in an app. I was neurotic about weighing and measuring portions. I researched healthy ways to dine out and ways to minimize calorie intake (custom ordering salads, etc.) I had to be very careful as I travel almost weekly for work and meal prep is difficult. For those who travel, I have tons of recommendations. \nModerate exercise to start then anywhere around 1-1.5 hours per day of cardio in later months. I would go to a spin class in the AM and then do a moderate walk on treadmill in the afternoons. Picked up spinning, running, cycling, etc. I developed rigorous training scheduled for biking distances and distance running. A lot of self motivation was required. \n\nThings I\u2019ve done since I lost the weight (and would have never dreamed about):\n1. 3 half marathons + various other races\n2. Biked a century ride down through Big Sur and Highway 1\n3. Tried rock climbing and repelling\n4. Hiking Zion, Yosemite, Great Wall of China and various other things. \n5. Wore a bikini (this is still not fun) \n\nPosting this today because I need some motivation. My partner and I have started a fairly strict keto diet partially to lose some fat but more so because there is some literature that it may help improve fertility which I\u2019m struggling with. I don\u2019t really feel like being on a strict diet again and counting macros, but I know it\u2019s 100% worth it if it works. \n\nProgress/transition:\n[progress/transition pics](https://imgur.com/gallery/EnjSIKe) \n\nTL;DR I lost 217 lbs from Jan 1, 2012 - Dec 1, 2013.

There are undoubtedly more impressive progress posts out there, but when I searched to find stories like mine to find inspiration to keep me going, I found none. That's why I wanted to write it all down: so that other \"true\" skinnyfat people can see that you can actually shake it off (not literally, although you could probably lose it by dancing too).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Background\n**TL;DR:**\n\n**07/2016:** 23/M/5'11/168lbs (1m80/76kg)\n\n**06/2018:** 25/M/5'11/168lbs (1m80/76kg)\n\nI know the dates say that it took 2 years, but it actually didn't. It's just the time in between the first and current picture. I just cruised for 8-9 months after my first \"cut\" (wasn't really a cut, more on that later) because I was pretty content. All in all, it took a bit over 1 year.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Pictures](https://i.imgur.com/EuLMb0P.jpg) (every picture is taken right after waking up. No pump and no food). I was fat at 210lbs/95kg (no picture), then skinnyfat at 168lbs/76kg, then skinny at 152lbs/69kg, bulked up to 174lbs/79kg and cut back down to 168lbs/76kg. \n\nOriginally I had 3 goals: lose the tits, lose the love handles and get abs. I have mild gyno so I'll probably never completely lose the moobs and all my fat goes to my lower back and lower abs so I probably won't lose my love handles until I am sub 10% body fat. The gyno and lower back fat are not really visible in the pictures (long live the nipple twist and loose fitting underwear), but they're still there (although they're maybe 10% of their original size). This is not my endstation but I'm happy with my progress.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Full story**\n\n***EDIT: holy fuck this turned out longer than I wanted. There's no vital info or tips in here, just my story so you don't have to read this unless you're actually interested. Scroll down to \"lift progress\" if you aren't.***\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Intro*\n\nI warned you.\n\nFor the majority of my life (10 y/o & onwards) I have always been \"the fat kid\". At around 18 years old, standing at roughly 210lbs (95kg), I had enough. Over the course of 2 years and a bit of yo-yo'ing, I dropped down to 168lbs (76kg). I hung around that weight for another year but still wasn't anywhere near a body I could be happy with. I was unhappy and bordering on depression.\n\nI'm pretty pear shaped (small shoulders, small lats, wide and high hips combined with a smaller waist, heavy legs). As a matter of fact, I think I was supposed to be a pear and got changed to be a human at the last second before being put on earth. Being skinnyfat didn't help.\n\nThen, one summer I went to a place with lots of fit and attractive people. That's when I had enough. Again. I thought \"if all these people can be fit, I can be fit too\". It was the proverbial drop in the bucket and finally mustered up the courage to start the \"road\" (for lack of a better word) to curing my skinnyfatness (paired with general unhappiness).\n\nI knew /r/fitness existed, but I never visited it. This changed and I started reading more and more, abusing the subs search function. Eventually I stumbled onto the the wiki which contained all the info I needed and off I went. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Cut 1: not really a cut*\n\n[START](https://i.imgur.com/fnv0b9g.jpg)\n\nJULY 2016: There were 3 options: cut, recomp or bulk. Recomping was out of the question pretty fast because it is pretty slow and I feared that that me being new to all this I would likely just be spinning my wheels. I didn't want to bulk either because I'd only get fatter. \n\nSo I started a cut. It was 80% diet, 15% cardio and 5% lifting, so not really a \"cut\" and more a \"dieting down\" to be honest. I didn't want to fork out the money for a gym membership and due to previous experiences, the gym wasn't appealing to me. I just did a little routine at home 3x per week (more on that in \"lift progress\").\n\nAt this point, I haven't heard about MyFitnessPal so I made my own [spreadsheet](https://imgur.com/mPqzViZ) and [database](https://imgur.com/ROsZred) (these are just snippets). I used this during the entirety of my cut (I'm just going to call it cut from now on because it's easier).\n\nI \"officially\" started the 27th of July 2016 and took a month break from mid October until mid november. Then I picked it up again until 28th of December.\n\n[END](https://i.imgur.com/5bRFm0a.jpg)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Contently cruising*\n\nNew year rolled around and by the time I was pretty happy with where I was. Still living the pear-life but I had abs for the first time in my life. This continued until around July 2017 (coincidentally right around the same event that got me started the year before) when I noticed that in my mind the \"you're skinny\" comments stopped registering as compliments and more and more as \"you're too skinny\". So I decided I'd like to have some more muscle on me. \n\nI also started to feel too weak (literally). It's really confronting when you come to the conclusion you're not the fat-but-strong guy any more because you're not fat any more.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Bulk 1: the wild ride*\n\n[START](https://i.imgur.com/PAzjs17.jpg)\n\nJuly 2017: Bulk. It can't be that hard. Just eat 250-500 above your TDEE and gain no more than 2lbs per month. Let's do this (with MyFitnessPal this time).\n\nFuck me sideways, I was wrong. The first month and a half I went up 10lbs. I could not figure out what was happening. I was eating what I was supposed to be eating and tracking correctly (cross-checked MFP with my own spreadsheet). Then, all of the sudden the weight gained stopped. Not tapered down, just flat out stopped.\n\nI still don't know what the fuck happened (could it be water retention from eating at such a low intake before and just more food in my stomach and bowels?), but I looked about the same so no big deal. I just continued. \n\nI also play sports, so due to the variations in the amount of training/games and intensity of said training/games it was very hard to consistently gain about 2lbs per month. Some months I gained 1lbs, some months I gained 4lbs. I retained some outline of my abs while increasing strength, so I wasn't too worried. The highest number I saw on my scale was 176 lbs (79.9kg), but the trend \"only\" gave 174lbs (79kg), so I'm rolling with that as official \"end weight\".\n\n[END](https://i.imgur.com/Ie1rznR.jpg)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Cut 2: a proper cut*\n\nMARCH 2018: I graduated and got a job. An active one. 3 months until summer and an active job, so no better time than then to start cutting. Lowered my intake gradually over the course of 3 months, while taking a 2 week break in the middle.\n\nPeople here often say \"bulk until you hate yourself, cut until you hate life\". I always thought the phrase was just for a laugh and because it's catchy, but I now realise it really isn't. I could lose a bit more fat (especially lower abs and lower back), but I'm absolutely 100% done for now. I think I'm a bit leaner than when I was 152lbs/69kg and hovering around 14-15% body fat.\n\n[END](https://i.imgur.com/mrbBlHp.jpg)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Lift Progress\n\nI know I'm still nowhere near \"strong\", but I think I made some pretty good progress so far. All lifts stayed the same during my cut up until last week.\n\n**Squat** \n\nStart 110lbs x 4 (50kg x 4)\n\nCurrent  231lbs x 4 (105kg x 4)\n\n**Bench Press**\n\nStart 100lbs x 4 (45kg x 4)\n\nCurrent  182lbs x 4 (82.5kg x 4)\n\n**Deadlift**\n\nStart 176lbs x 4 (80kg x 4)\n\nCurrent  315lbs x 6 (142.5kg x 6)\n\n**Overhead Press** \n\nStart 60lbs x 4 (27.5kg x 4)\n\nCurrent  127lbs x 4 (57.5kg x 4)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDuring the first cut I did a stupid little self-made routine because I didn't want to go to a gym. It basically consisted of 3x33+1 decline sit-ups, 3x1 minute elbow planks (normal and side), 3x10 EZ bar curls, 3x10 tricep pushdowns and sometimes 3x10 DB rows if I felt like it.\n\nI didn't do any lifting during my cruising period.\n\nWhen I decided I wanted to go to the gym and bulk, I had a lot of time so I wanted a routine that made use of that. I also wanted a routine with lots of shoulder and chest work and I didn't want to go more than 3 days per week to the gym. I also read you should train in different rep ranges and you need both vertical and horizontal pulling. After a bit of reading a searching around, I picked [lvysaur's 4-4-8](https://i.imgur.com/SKruJBF.png) and I didn't regret it for a single moment. Bench and OHP everyday, varying rep ranges, high-rep deadlifts, chin-ups, ... It fit all the requirements. I still don't get why it doesn't get mentioned more. The only thing I did was add some core work and face pulls + lat raises (alternating every gymday) and dialed back the progression a bit in the end.\n\nAround mid december I switched to 5/3/1 BBB because I felt my linear gains were starting to run out (in hindsight it might have been because I didn't eat enough) and I was ready to commit to 4 days per week. Did a couple of cycles until I started my cut in March.\n\nWhen I started my cut, I tried continuing 5/3/1 BBB but ended after 1 cycle. I switched to GZCL The Rippler but, while it's a perfectly fine program, I didn't really like it. It took around the same time as 5/3/1 BBB (maybe even a bit longer) but I felt I was doing less. Also, I don't like the very low rep sets (1-2 reps per set). I ended up switching to 5/3/1 Triumvirate+FSL, which I am still doing now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Diet\n\n**Food**\n\nI'm 100% convinced I have a slower-than-average metabolism. During my first cut I averaged around 1700kcal and lost about 1 lbs (0.45kg) per week. I did at least 3x per week cardio (1x HIIT, 1 training, 1 game). 1700kcal is very low for a 5'11 168lbs male, but such is life.\n\nDuring my bulk I started at 2600kcal while blowing up 10lbs. Didn't know what the fuck I had to do so I dialled it back to ~2400 kcal but kept on gaining like a I was getting ready for hibernation. When I finally stopped gaining, I gradually upped my intake every couple of weeks and ended up around 3100kcal (I gained a little bit too fast for my liking at 3100kcal to I dialled it back a bit to 2900-3000kcal).\n\nI started my second cut back at 2400kcal, but I wasn't losing any weight (nor was I gaining). 2300. Nothing. 2200. Nothing. Again, no fucking clue why it didn't budge. I wasn't gaining at 2600 earlier, not I'm not losing at 2200. Blows my mind.\n\nAnyway, I gradually reduced until I started seeing the scale move. This started at around 2100kcal and now I'm at 1800kcal.\n\nI'm now at a point where it's mentally very hard and I'm struggling to get myself to the gym, let alone performing decently which is a red flag for me. I'm ending it here.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Macros**\n\n- 160-180g protein.\n\n- 70g fat (I often don't make this number, its closer to 50)\n\n- rest are carbs\n\nClassic IIFYM diet. Chicken, swedish quark, dark bread, rice, potatoes and eggs are my staple foods. I eat the same things almost everyday because it's easy and I don't mind.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Supplements**\n\nZinc, Vit D and Magnesium. Because they all showed up to be defeicient or on the low side according to my blood tests.\n\nNo creatine or protein shakes. No creatine because I didn't feel like I needed it and because of the supposed links with male pattern baldness (rather be safe than sorry) and no protein shakes because I get sufficient protein from food.\n\n**EDIT:** added macros and suplements\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Optional\n\n**Future Goals**\n\nI'm not where I want to end yet, but I'm happy with my progress so far. I could still lose a couple of pounds of fat, but I'd rather gain a bit more muscle & strength first. I think I'm gonna do 6 week bulk (the length of 2 5/3/1 cycles) & 2-3 week cut cycles and see how it goes. Also, I'm going to switch back to 5/3/1 BBB, still focussing on lats and shoulders because they're still my weak point (fucking genetics man).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**In conclusion**\n\nI'd like to say the following: /r/fitness is often criticized (mainly by /r/fitness itself) but I don't think you lot realise (especially the ones that are very active) how much you can change peoples lives (mine for example). So much actual knowledge bunched up in this subreddit (if you know where and how to look). You'd have to read countless books and take a metric ton of courses to get close to what you can read here in just a few clicks. **All for free.**\n\nA genuine thank you to everyone who contributes in here.\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "26/M/5'11 Textbook skinnyfat progress. 168lbs to 168lbs.", "post_ups": 4183, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8rtgw8/26m511_textbook_skinnyfat_progress_168lbs_to/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:10.322704", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Tovero", "post_created_utc": 1459215763.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1459250184.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "4cdc5n", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 331, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 4157, "post_selftext": "My deadlift has always been my strong point, and I have posted here before about my deadlift (405lb pull found [HERE](https://www.instagram.com/p/BBWcOtbioHi/?taken-by=pumping.fe)), but I am finally getting my squat to catch up and am super excited!

During 3 controlled intervention days HIGH's water intake was restricted to 1 L/day whereas LOW's was increased to 2.5 L water/day. Several mood scales (Bond & Lader Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Profile of Mood States, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, Thirst & Emotional VAS) were administered at different time points during the study. ANOVA including intervention, time point and intervention by time point as fixed effects on mean values (i.e.; baseline data vs. mean of 3 intervention days) for each mood scale was performed.\n\n>RESULTS:\n\n>At baseline HIGH and LOW were comparable in mood state, except for thirst scores (estimate\u200a=\u200a17.16, p<0.001) and POMS depression-dejection scores (estimate\u200a=\u200a0.55, p<0.05) which were both higher in the HIGH vs. LOW. In HIGH the restricted water intake resulted in a significant increase in thirst (p<0.001) and a decrease in contentedness (p<0.05), calmness (p<0.01), positive emotions (p<0.05) and vigor/activity (p<0.001). In LOW, increased water consumption resulted in a significant decrease in fatigue/inertia (p<0.001), confusion/bewilderment (p\u200a=\u200a0.05) and thirst (p<0.001) and a trend to lower sleepiness (p\u200a=\u200a0.07) compared to baseline.\n\n>CONCLUSION:\n\n>Increasing water intake has beneficial effects in LOW, especially sleep/wake feelings, whereas decreasing water intake has detrimental effects on HIGH's mood. These deleterious effects in HIGH were observed in some sleep/wake moods as well as calmness, satisfaction and positive emotions.\n\n\n\nOf course, there's the problem of lack of comparison against placebo treatment, but that could be hard to test given that water is already the most inert substance that we can drink. \n\nSaid that, I still think this study is very relevant, since both groups felt coherent changes.

Not sure what to do and how to start the journey back to health.\n\nA brief Timeline:\nThis is me when I started the Journey\n\n(Edited to add another picture that my Daughter contributed from Mother's Day 2014. what a sad photo.)\n[Mother's Day 2014](http://i.imgur.com/wjeDwoG.jpg)\n\n[412 Lbs in April of 2014 - 132 lbs lost in 9 months](http://i.imgur.com/UILdD1g.jpg)\n\n*April 12th 2014 - I had Strep Throat and went to the Dr. for a prescription. Their scale read 412 lbs and I was devastated. as long as I avoided actually confronting the numbers on the scale. I could ignore how heavy I was. sort of, I was sick all the time, and getting dizzy, and generally feeling horrible.  I decided to cut out Soda with sugar. \n\n*Mothers Day May 11th 2014 - My sister is a Type 2 diabetic and I asked her to check my blood sugar readings after dinner. Hers was 118 and mine was 289. That's not good. In fact, that's the type of number which indicates organ damage if left untreated.\n\n*May 12th 2014 - The day after Mothers Day I asked my Doctor to run a Fasting Glucose test and it came back at 279 which is really bad. His reaction was, \"You Win!.. I told you to cut sugar and lose weight.. you didn't.. so you win the prize. Type 2 Diabetes..\" I love my Doctor, he's a smartass like me. (no, really I do.. good guy.) They put me on the big 3. Metformin, Lisinopril & Simvastatin. Now I'm an adult right? I'm on 3 lifetime medicines for a disease! YAY! not \n* But, cutting out the sugar in my soda.. I had lost 15 lbs. Hmmmm. so, cutting sugar helps me lose weight. without doing anything else. I've already jacked up my pancreas and won't be using Insulin to get rid of sugar the normal way. so lets just avoid sugar all together.*\n\n*August 2014 - They run this test to check your \"average Blood Sugar levels\" called the A1C which tells them how much sugar was left floating around inside your bloodstream after the insulin did its job. I had quit eating all forms of simple starches.. NO Sugar, NO Bread or Tortillas, NO Pasta, NO Rice, NO Potatoes, NO Simple Starches at all..  TONS of veggies. Broccoli, Cauliflower, Green Beans, Carrots (yes they have a little sugar but they're good for you, hush) Veggies, Veggies, Veggies, and Meat, Lean and not Lean, meat, Meat, MEAT.. I did make a conscious choice to avoid eating bacon and fatty meats often.. I wasn't shooting for a Atkins high level Ketosis state. I was shooting for a state where my body didn't have easy to store Carbs.. I didn't count calories and just ate when hungry.. I portioned out meat.. 8 oz of chicken or beef cubes. frozen in small tupperware containers. and added them to veggies with Sriracha and Soy Sauce. and whatever else caught my fancy. usually Parmesan cheese or a little cheddar. And I walked on a treadmill at the gym. 5x a week for 45 min each time..  and the weight fell off.. \nI'd lost 60 lbs and was down to 337 and my A1C of 5.3 indicated my average BS was 118 over the past 3 months now. that's still a tad high for a normal person if you use conservative measures of Blood Sugar. and I'm eating no carbs at all but it's safe... \n\n* November 2014 -  They checked my A1C again and it's still at 118 BS (5.3-5.4 A1C range) and I'm down to 297 Lbs (another 40 lbs lost). They're taking me off all of my meds and the issues I have with my back are going away now that my weight is down. I can finally walk with less pain and my limp from the Stenosis in my back is going away. I join a Gym.\n\n*Feb 2015 - I've been at 280 lbs for the past 2 months. but I've lost inches of fat off my chest and lost multiple inches off my waist and belly. I've been lifting as heavy as possible to build muscle. I would like ideally to make this last part of the conversion a plateau before a fast drop. but the plateau will be a fat burning and muscle building plateau. :)\n\nIt's a long process.. I'm 44 and not 24.. so the skin doesn't have elasticity it once did.. after I get down to a good weight, I'll have surgery to remove some skin.. which is not... not.. not... pretty.. \nSo I won't be sharing any body pictures in my undies.. sorry Ladies (and Gents who're into that type of thing. ;) )  but I do have a picture from a few days ago.. freshly shaved head.. and full body picture from about a month ago.. although I have lost some belly, you couldn't tell by how I was dressed anyhow. :) \n[Weight Loss Journey 75% done](http://i.imgur.com/l2x7x7g.jpg)\n\n[280 lbs in Feb of 2015 - 132 lbs lost in 9 months](http://i.imgur.com/GhOhWL4.jpg)\n\nI decided to add something in here at the end:\nWhen you're working on your own fitness or weight loss plan: \n#1 Forgive yourself when you mess up.\n#2 Figure out what triggered the slip.\n#3 Fix the problem that caused the slip.\n#4 Forge ahead.\nWe'll call it the 4-F's of dealing with setbacks.. and there will be setbacks. \nIt's a long game.

I really hope that this helps someone, if it helps anyone at all it will have been worth the effort of typing this long spiel. \n\n\nFor most of my life I have suffered from depression and anxiety, even from the age of 8 I can remember being depressed. I had been on a variety of anti-depressants and I never really liked how they made me feel, I'm sure if I stuck with them I could have found one that worked for me but I just didn't like them so decided to live without. \n\n\nA little over 3 years ago I ended up going to therapy as my depression was affecting my relationship(s) in a very negative way. I expressed that I really didn't want to go on anti-depressants or anything again and my therapist kept recommending exercising to me, insisting that I join a gym. It took me like 6 or more sessions to finally listen to her and joined a gym, only to prove to her that she was wrong and it wouldn't help.\n\n\nI absolutely hated it at first, everything about it. I had terrible anxiety anytime I would walk in the door. I hated the million mirrors everywhere, I felt like everyone was judging me for obviously having no idea what I was doing. I kept at it though, in order to prove my therapist wrong. Eventually I started to not hate it, and then surprisingly I noticed I actually looked forward to going to the gym. \n\n\nA little over three years later and here I am. I went from severely depressed, doing literally nothing ever. I would wake up 20 minutes before work, come home and sit on the couch for 5 hours only to sleep another 11-12 hours and then repeat. My diet consisted of fast food and junk food, no wonder I felt like shit all the time. \n\n\nNow I wake up at 5:30am every day, go to yoga, go to work, go to the gym, come home and make a healthy dinner, hang out with my soon-to-be husband/animals and go to bed. \n\n\nMy physical progress:\nStomach: http://i.imgur.com/ClDG4Pu.jpg\nBack: http://i.imgur.com/Q6GeWHA.jpg\nArms: http://i.imgur.com/bt37N6d.jpg\n\nNutrition:\n\nI basically eat the same things every day, mainly out of laziness and a hatred for cooking. I know there are TONS of options out there for a healthy/fit lifestyle I am just far too lazy to make any of them, and I'm a shit cook as well so I keep it very simple.\n\n\nBreakfast: 3 eggs, 1 cup of egg whites - scrambled with butter to grease the pan. Cup of coffee with full fat, full sugar cream because it's something I just don't want to cut out. \n\n\nSnack: 500g plain greek yogurt, mixed with a handful of blended frozen strawberries, and a banana \n\n\nLunch: Turkey meatballs made with eggs, bread crumbs, onions and ground turkey. Not sure of the exact measurements but I eat 2lbs of it over the course of a week. Green smoothie with kale, spinach, mangoes, orange juice and water. \n\n\nDinner: Varies. Favourite meals include 2 tacos with lean ground beef in soft tortilla shells and veggies + salsa. Chicken quesadillas in the same, steak with potatoes and veggies or really any kind of meat with potatoes and veggies. On leg days I'll eat pasta. \n\n\nSnack: Usually some fruit, cherries, grapes, apples are my faves.\n\n**** EDIT: forgot to add I have one scoop of bcaa's during every work out and one scoop of protein powder with water after every workout\n\n\nI normally only eat like this during the week. On the weekends I am much more relaxed about my diet, I like to go out for dinner once a week. I like to drink wine sometimes. I don't deprive myself of anything, there are weekends I am really \"bad\" about the food I eat, and there are weekends where I'm pretty \"good\". Sometimes I get food guilt but I really try not to beat myself up about it because I know the majority of the time I eat well. \n\n\nWork Outs:\n\nMonday - Glute focused leg day \n\n* 5 sets of 12 - Split squats using the smith machine, start with 50lbs end up at 75lbs \n\n* 5 sets of 15 - Glute bridges using the smith machine with increasing weight. currently start at 200lbs and end up at 300lbs \n\n* 5 sets of 12 - squats - start at 60lbs end up at 90lbs hack squats \n\n* 3 sets of 12 - hack squats - start at 80lbs end at 100lbs 6 sets of 12 - leg press - I do alternating between narrow and wide legs.

Lately I've been asking a friend to push down my legs cause it's gotten a bit easy now. \n\n* 3 sets of 15 ab rollouts from knees, working towards being able to do it standing. \n\n* 3 sets of 15 - not sure what it's called but basically leg lifts on an incline bench, raise legs to tummy then push up so only my upper back is on the bench\n\n\nThursday - Legs I do the same glute bridges, split squats, squats, and leg press on this day too. \n\n* Seated leg curl - 3 sets of 15 - start with 45lbs and with 55lbs \n\n* Leg extensions - 3 sets of 15 - start with 75lbs end with 90lbs\n\n\nFriday - Chest/Shoulders \n\n* Bench press - 3 sets of 12 - start with the bar end up with like 50lbs including the bar \n\n* Incline bench press - 3 sets of 12 start with 15lbs on each arm end up with 20lbs \n\n* Pec Fly (machine) - 3 sets of 12 - start with 40lbs end with 50 \n\n* Rear Delts - 3 sets of 12 - start with 40lbs end with 50 Shoulder press - 3 sets of 12 - start with 10lbs each end with 20lbs each \n\n* Front plate raise - 3 sets of 12 - 25lbs each time \n\nAbs - weighted crunch machine, cable crunches, ab rollouts, nearly laying down kettle bell crossovers\n\nWeekends are my rest days, though I go hiking as often as possible, as I have a giant passion for photography and love the combination of fresh air, exercise and the beauty of nature. \n\nSometimes I'll do 20+ minutes of high speed steps on the stepmill before my workout, lately i haven't done much cardio though cause I had bronchitis and never got back into it. But I will be starting that again so I can have better endurance for my longer hikes.\n\nWhen I first started out I did a full body routine 3x a week. I recommend that for beginners as if you start out with what I'm doing currently you will likely hate it and not want to go back. I love lifting because I love setting and breaking PR's, I love feeling strong, and I LOVE the way it makes me feel and look. \n\nI realize now that no one was judging me when I first went to the gym, I do not judge anyone that goes there whether they are new or not. I respect everyone in there for making an effort to better themselves physically and mentally. Some days it is still a struggle to go, especially when I'm having an off day and feel the depression trying to take hold of me again. It's on those days that you need to exercise the most. \n\nAnyway, if anyone reads this thank you! It was a loong post and I appreciate you for taking the time to read it.

However, if you plan on using them to gain strength or muscle mass, they\u2019re poor options. \n\nMany of you might say you\u2019ve ran SL and SS and got fine results, but that\u2019s not really what makes a good program for a new lifter. New lifters can see results from doing damn near anything. A good beginner program gets you results *efficiently*. So, here\u2019s why I believe the base SL and SS programs are suboptimal, and how you should tweak them. To keep things simple, I\u2019ll be focusing my critiques on SL, but the majority carries over to SS as well.\n\n\u00a0\n\n1: *Lack of frequency*\n\nThis one is especially funny since SL is often referred to as a high-frequency program. I disagree with that label. Over a two-week period, you hit your pecs, biceps, and shoulders (the muscles most guys care about for aesthetics) only three times. Elevated muscle protein synthesis, the driver of hypertrophy ([1](https://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/musclesgrowLK.html)), lasts roughly 36 hours after training ([2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8563679)). Since you should keep protein synthesis elevated as much as possible, averaging 112 hours between muscle stimuli as SL does is far from optimal. Even while controlling for volume and intensity, high frequency generally beats out low frequency for both muscle and strength development ([3](http://strengtheory.com/high-frequency-training-for-a-bigger-total-research-on-highly-trained-norwegian-powerlifters/)).\n\nFix: Bench and Overhead Press every workout.\n\n2: *Lack of volume*\n\nIncrease in muscle mass trends logarithmically over time, meaning beginner lifters can gain the most muscle in the least amount of time. This is important even if you\u2019re only interested in strength, because increasing your muscle mass is the best way to increase your strength ([4](http://strengtheory.com/powerlifters-should-train-more-like-bodybuilders/)). Researchers recommend a minimum of ten weekly sets for each muscle to see good results ([8](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02640414.2016.1210197))- SL gives you 7.5 for pecs, shoulders, and biceps, and 1.5 for hamstrings. This means increasing sets ([5](http://strengtheory.com/more-is-more/)) and reps per set ([6](http://strengtheory.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/)) are the best ways to maximize both aesthetic and strength progress.\n\nFix: Do more sets and more reps when possible.\n\n3: *Lack of bicep involvement*\n\nRows and cleans alone aren\u2019t great at growing biceps. Your biceps are only secondary muscles involved in the movements, meaning they won\u2019t really be taken anywhere close to failure. Since number of sets near muscular failure is the primary factor when inspiring protein synthesis ([6](http://strengtheory.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/)), your bicep development will be subpar if you don\u2019t fix this.\n\nFix:\tIdeally, add Chin-Ups. Not only do they hit the biceps hard, but the extra back work will balance out your increased benching. If you can\u2019t do Chin-Ups, do 30\u00b0 Bent-Over Rows with supinated grip, which shifts emphasis to the biceps ([7](http://breakingmuscle.com/strength-conditioning/pull-up-vs-chin-up-a-comparison-and-analysis)).\n\n4: *Poopoo lower body programming*\n\nIf you\u2019re mainly interested in aesthetics, SL is probably a bit squat-heavy for you. If you\u2019re mainly interested in strength, 1x5 deadlifts three times every two weeks is a bad plan. Taking the time to warm up and load the bar, only to perform one serious set is not an efficient way to spend your time. The idea that you should only do 1 set because CNS fatigue is silly. SL is made for beginners using light weight. CNS fatigue is not an issue for them. The idea that you should only do 1 set to avoid form breakdown is flawed as well. The programs are designed to eventually push you to form breakdown regardless of how many sets you\u2019ve performed, so that\u2019s inevitable. On top of all of this, Deadlifts are really the only exercise in the program that hit your hamstrings (no, Squats don\u2019t to a significant degree [[9](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19130646)])- why give them a measly 3 total sets every two weeks?\n\nFix: Squat less, Deadlift more. The increased leg work from Deadlifts will make up for decreasing Squats.\n\n5: *No periodization*\n\nThis one\u2019s simple: Not varying your rep ranges is sub-optimal for both strength and hypertrophy progress ([10](http://strengtheory.com/in-defense-of-program-hoppers-dup-revisited/)). SL sacrifices this great strategy in the name of simplicity. I think you can handle a little variation. You\u2019re not stupid.\n\nFix: Vary your rep ranges.\n\n6: *Boring start*\n\nIf you\u2019re healthy and just getting into lifting, it can take you a considerable amount of time to get to challenging weights following the typical SL progression scheme. Going so long without being challenged will have new lifters quitting before they even start touching real weights.\n\nFix: Use infrequent AMRAP (as many reps as possible) sets to determine progression speed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nApplying all the changes I suggested, you get something like this:\n\n[lvysaur\u2019s Beginner 4-4-8 Program](http://i.imgur.com/SKruJBF.png)\n \nThe weight progression is a tiny bit more complicated, but I think most are willing to put in a few minutes of extra thought in exchange for better progress. \nSince your 8 rep weight should be ~90% of your 4 rep weight, your 4 rep weight would begin at 50lb if you want to start with the bar for 8 rep sets.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHere are some questions I anticipate:\n\n*Why 4 sets?*  \nTo respect time constraints. Do 5 if you want.\n\n*I can\u2019t do Chin-Ups?*  \n30\u00b0 Bent-Over Rows with supinated grip.\n\n*I can do more than 4/8 Chin-Ups?*  \nWeighted Chin-Ups.\n\n*How much do I deload after failure?*  \nNo change here. 10% as a beginner.\n\n*How do I progress?*  \nSmallest incremental jumps possible between workouts to meet the weekly goal.  \n\n*Why alternate Squats and Deadlift days?*  \nDeadlifting after Squatting sucks, and doing both on the same day would take a lot of time. Do both every day if you want.\nI also didn\u2019t want to suggest something like 2 sets of each lift every day because that would become inefficient when you factor in warming up, loading the bar, waiting for a rack, etc.\n\n*Why not alternate starting Overhead Press vs starting Bench?*  \nDoing so would introduce fluctuating levels of fatigue to the lifts, which I don\u2019t think is appropriate %RM based linear progression program. It can definitely work if you used RPE to autoregulate your weights, but I don\u2019t think beginners have the experience necessary to do so.  \nI opted to start Bench because more people care about Bench. Start Overhead Press if you want.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSources \u2013 thanks /u/gnuckols  \n1. https://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/musclesgrowLK.html  \n2.\thttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8563679  \n3.\thttp://strengtheory.com/high-frequency-training-for-a-bigger-total-research-on-highly-trained-norwegian-powerlifters/  \n4.\thttp://strengtheory.com/powerlifters-should-train-more-like-bodybuilders/  \n5.\thttp://strengtheory.com/more-is-more/  \n6.\thttp://strengtheory.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/  \n7.\thttp://breakingmuscle.com/strength-conditioning/pull-up-vs-chin-up-a-comparison-and-analysis  \n8. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02640414.2016.1210197  \n9.\thttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19130646  \n10.\thttp://strengtheory.com/in-defense-of-program-hoppers-dup-revisited/", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "A detailed look at why StrongLifts & Starting Strength aren't great beginner programs, and how to fix them - lvysaur's Beginner 4-4-8 Program", "post_ups": 4130, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4uijsl/a_detailed_look_at_why_stronglifts_starting/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:10.322922", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "_fuce", "post_created_utc": 1451388691.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1458341620.0, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "3yn9sr", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 561, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 4124, "post_selftext": "I lost 40 pounds in 67 days.  \n\nBefore and after: http://imgur.com/16BnlKA\n\n\nFor backstory, I went through ugly stuff two months ago and was low as hell.

It's cheap and it has more research supporting its efficacy than any other supplement out there (except, perhaps, for protein supplements if you don't get enough protein from your diet).\n\nHowever, creatine does a lot of other interesting stuff beyond just helping you train a little harder and build more muscle and strength.  Since there are a lot of questions about creatine on /r/fitness, I thought this article would be of interest for a lot of folks:\n\n[Not Another Boring Creatine Guide: Answers to FAQs and Lesser-Known Benefits](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/creatine/)\n\nHere's the short version:\n\n**Basic Stuff**\n\n1) Creatine primarily works via allowing you to train harder (since it increases the supply of readily available energy for high-intensity contractions).  However, it also has direct effects on signaling pathways that contribute to growth.\n\n2) So far, plain old creatine monohydrate seems to work as well as other fancier (and more expensive) forms of creatine.\n\n3) Assuming you plan on taking creatine long-term, there's not much reason to do a high-dose creatine \"loading\" phase.  Your muscles will attain full saturation in 3-4 weeks anyways.\n\n**More Interesting Stuff**\n\n4) Some people are creatine \"nonresponders,\" meaning that creatine supplementation doesn't increase muscle creatine levels.  However, these people tend to be the folks who had higher creatine levels prior to supplementation anyways, so they're not really missing out on anything.\n\n5) Creatine supplementation can actually improve bone health\n\n6) Creatine can improve brain health and mental performance, especially when you're tired or stressed\n\n7) Most of the benefits of creatine (especially the mental and cognitive benefits) seem to be larger in vegetarians and vegans than omnivores (since they're not getting nearly as much creatine from their diet).\n\n8) Creatine doesn't cause dehydration.  In fact, it may actually decrease incidences of heat illness and cramping when exercising in the heat (suggesting it may improve hydration status).\n\n9) Creatine *may* make asthma symptoms worse, though that effect seems to be ameliorated by aerobic exercise.\n\n10) The infamous study which found that creatine increased DHT levels (a hormone associated with hair loss) has probably been blown out of proportion.\n\n11) The effects of creatine *may* be blunted by taking it with high doses of caffeine.  If that's something you're worried about, just taking creatine and caffeine at different times (i.e. caffeine pre-workout and creatine post-workout) should negate that interaction.\n\nThat's the VERY abbreviated version (the whole article is probably a 20-25 minute read).  Full disclosure:  the article is published on my website.  However, I did not write it.  The author, Eric Trexler, has his PhD in exercise ehysiology, and most of his research is in sports nutrition and supplementation (including research on creatine).  So, I'm clearly biased about this article, but the author is an actual expert on the topic.\n\nIf you're interested in getting into the nitty gritty details, I'd strongly recommend reading the full article, since it goes into a lot more depth than my tl;dr:\n\n[Not Another Boring Creatine Guide: Answers to FAQs and Lesser-Known Benefits](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/creatine/)", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "More than you ever wanted to know about creatine", "post_ups": 4114, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/av1m8l/more_than_you_ever_wanted_to_know_about_creatine/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:10.322922", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Fang88", "post_created_utc": 1430492000.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "34itku", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 1393, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 4102, "post_selftext": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10nI8r22wcw&feature=youtu.be&t=10m36s\n\nDoes this actually work or is it just psuedo-science?", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "TIL that Floyd Mayweather stands in a cryogenic chamber cooled to -240 degrees in order to help him recover from training.", "post_ups": 4102, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/34itku/til_that_floyd_mayweather_stands_in_a_cryogenic/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:10.322922", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "", "post_created_utc": 1454880156.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1454957039.0, "post_gilded": 2, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 2, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "44nna6", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 509, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 4095, "post_selftext": "http://imgur.com/a/gsBnx\n\nEDIT: I AM IN HIGHSCHOOL ALREADY\n\nSoooooo, here we are. I'm a 14 year old from Texas. Obese since the sixth grade, prediabetic since 7th. I honestly don't know how it got as bad as it did. I mean, we were poor and sometimes we had to just get by on a box of cereal for the day so maybe that was it. \n\nEither way, on June 13th, 2015, I posted on /r/diabetes asking if it was a reversible disease. I got referred to /r/keto. This is where I started.\n\nI started eating only 20g of carbs a day, strictly. I never counted calories and I basically didn't pay attention to anything other than that. I also drank only water. I kept this up for a while. It was really easy because during the summer I would just stay up all night playing world of Warcraft, and have bottles of water everywhere and instead of snacking I would just drink water if I got hungry. This is how I lived for a while. \n\nThen school started. I kept up my carb counting for the majority of the first semester. In December I started getting out of that and just ate less and only drank diet sodas and water. This is basically where I am now. I haven't gained any weight back. \n\nSo that was the nutrition, now let's get to the lifts(u mirin bro?). No, seriously, I did start lifting. I joined my schools track and field team in January and joined powerlifting. I'm set to be in football next year.\n\nBefore this I would go to the gym a minimum of once a week but usually three times a week. I never did any routines because I didn't know how to do most free weight exercises correctly.  \n\nSince then I've been training a lot. Usually during the day we do speed weights which is however many Reps you can do in 45 seconds of whatever station you're at. Usually it goes - \n\nChainsaws@75lb\nMilitary press@45\nDips\nLat pull downs@135\nBench@135\nSquat@225\nPower cleans@115\nLeg press@200\n\nAfter school is basically the same, except we don't do speed weights we just go everything 3x15. \n\nMy half mile is 3:50 now.\n\nPowerlifting: \nWith powerlifting, at first I was scared, until I realized it's only three lifts and the worst that happens is you scratch the weight for that try. So as of right now, here's my stuffs: \n\nSquat: 295\nBench:175\nDeadlift:315 \n So yeah, that's my stuff. I did this whole transformation in six months. That picture is from July 4th. To yesterday.

Each is annotated for clarity.](http://imgur.com/a/aWLXG)\n\n*****************************************\n*****************************************\n\n**Story:**\n\n\u200bWhen I was a kid I was told I would never be fat. My mom even had trouble finding pants that could fit me properly. But just before puberty I began to gain weight. By the time I graduated from High School I was ~320lbs. Started college and gain an additional 40lbs within the first 2 years. When I was 19, I was rushed to the ER from work with severe chest pains and shortness of breath, the initial thought was heart attack, but luckily it was a massive panic attack. Nevertheless, I was put on blood pressure meds and told to lose weight. Of course, I didn't do that. My Junior* year of college I moved to main campus, weighing about 390, and reached 400+ by end of the 1st year on campus.\n\n\nSecond year of on campus I moved with friends from back home. This was when I reached my max of 407.8lbs. It is very possible that I weighed more, but the 407.8 figure is the highest I found logged by a medical office, so it is the one I use. Anyway, one night my friends invited me to the gym and to this day I am quite sure they were only being nice to the fat guy/friend. But, for some reason I went. I picked a recumbent cycle and went about 30 minutes for a distance of about 3.5 miles. I remember distinctly thinking that I must not have been as out of shape as I thought I was.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up at 7am to get ready for my 8am Psych class ... to this day, it is hte only class I ever missed for something like this. I literally could not walk. My legs felt heavy and radiated pain into my pelvis every time I moved. It was a good half hour before I was finally able to hobble done to the bathroom to pee. I was 24 years old and if someone on the floor had access to a walker, I would have used it without question. \n\nWhat happened next is hard to explain, I don't really even understand it myself. My legs continued to feel better and I felt there was something that had changed in me. The idea that I did this to myself, but knowing that when it was better it would never be this bad again. Two days later, I went back. I was, once again, sore but this time I could walk. 3 times a week that first month netted me a 35lbs loss. It was enough to be my catalyst for change so I kept going. At the end of the first year I had lost 120lbs. That was 120lbs I would never gain back.\n\nAs I continued to lose I got very sick and no one could tell me what was wrong. I was terrified it was undiagnosed cancer or something worse. Finally, at 30 years old a Nurse Practitioner successfully diagnosed gall stones (which has been previously ruled out by a HIDA scan). A week after the surgeon's consult, I was in surgery. I had 8 primary gallstones, all of them larger than 1/2\" with the largest being just over an inch in diameter. These are apparently common in people losing a lot of weight. The ordeal had set me back about ~40lbs.\n\nA year after that I was down a total of 165 lbs when I severely screwed my back up laying hardwood. Unfortunately, this is not a double entendre, it was hardwood flooring and I was basically in the bed for weeks, followed by physical therapy for another 3 months. After an MRI it was discovered this was my obesity coming back to haunt me. I had a lateral bulged disc at L4/5 with moderate foraminal stenosis causing a lot of pain down my left side, but no central stenosis, so that was good. With PT this resided and I have been on a strict core workout regimen to keep myself pain free. This time, I had gained almost 50lbs back.\n\nFor the years after that, I yo-yo'ed pretty regularly as is the custom of most previously obese people. Mostly I stayed between 230lbs and 250lbs. I knew how to drop weight, but hadn't yet learned how to properly change my lifestyle to the point where I could keep it off. But it would come in time.\n\nFast forward to now, I am 38 years old, I have surrounded myself with friends who are active and supportive. They understand the struggle I have been through and refuse to let me fail. I have finally trained my family to not throw out the \"But you're skinny, you can have a couple bites.\" or the grandma favorite \"You're getting too skinny, you need to stop losing weight.\" These things combined has helped finally move my head into the mental space where it needs to be to be successful on a long-term basis. I also think switching to the concept of \"getting better\" (lifting, looking better, etc) versus \"weigh less\" helped a lot too. The scale is a good tool, but if you start lifting and you aren't obese, it is a poor indicator of your overall success.\n\nThirteen weeks ago I hurt my shoulder. It is the first upper body injury I have had in my life. Before the aforementioned mental shift I would have rested and recovered. But not now. As such, I merely changed my habits to accommodate this injury. I talked to my doctors and physical therapist to develop a short term program where I can workout, but with minimal shoulder involvement. I work legs 3 times a week and cardio the other 4, usually a stairclimber for 30-60 minutes. leg exercises avoid loading the shoulders/traps with significant amounts of weight. The doctors assure me that I'll be back to lifting soon.\n\n*****************************************\n*****************************************\n\n**Diet:** \n\nI have basically been on all of the options at some point. Low-fat is where I started, then moved to high-protein for a stretch. After about a year of yo-yo dieting, I adhered to a strict ketogenic diet for nearly 3 years. I cut about 45lbs off on keto, not much for 3 years, but I lost it and kept it off. For the last ~9 months I have switched to a IIFYM style of eating, which is, in my humble opinion, the best out of the various options. \n\nI eat roughly 2500-2600 calories a day when actively lifting and trying to put on muscle. During cuts, I drop to a crazy, but effective, 1600-1700 calorie/day diet that is heavy on protein to help maintain lean mass. Protein always stays at, or above 195g/day. I think due to my history of dieting and focusing so much on weight loss I need the ultra low calories to be effective in dropping fat, 2000/day doesn't seem to help me drop weight. When I move back to a lifting caloric load I have to do it slowly over a few weeks, otherwise I get really sick to my stomach and seem to pack on fat quick.\n\n*****************************************\n*****************************************\n\n**Exercise:** \n\nMy approach to fitness is functional with a heavy slant on looking decent. So I guess I want to just look like the classic \"male.\" Im not in the gym to impress or break records (other than my own). Due to some former fattie issues I can't really deadlift, so I rack pull and dumbell Romanian DL instead. I can squat, but Im still working on form for BB squat, so I do a heavy amount of DB goblet squats. As for bench, I prefer incline over flat, and as I mentioned earlier, before the injury my PR was 2 sets of 5 at 185lbs.\n\nWhen lifting I run a 6 day split. \n\n* Monday is Chest/Tricep \n* Tuesday is Core/Legs \n* Weds is Back/Bicep \n* Thursday is Aux/Cardio \n* Friday is Shoulders\n* Sat is Legs. \n\nAs I said previously, I like the stairmaster for cardio, but I also jog and use the spin bikes at the gym.\n\nCurrently, due to my injury, I do ... \n\n* Legs on Monday\n* Cardio/Core on Tuesday\n* Legs/Light Chest on Weds\n* Cardio on Thursday\n* Light All Over/Cardio on Friday\n* Legs on Sat. \n\nI also hike when I can with a light pack to prevent loading my shoulder too much.\n\n*****************************************\n*****************************************\n\n**Tech:** \n\nI have religiously worn a Polar M400 for the last 2.5 years, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Only taking it off for the few hours needed to recharge it every 2 weeks or so. I love it and it serves well as a motivator and it reminds me to get up and move. *FYI I like to remind people that if you use some sort of tracker tech, remember to update the weight it uses for calorie calculations, as you lose, to make sure you're getting as accurate a count as possible.*\n\n*****************************************\n*****************************************\n\n\u200b**Aftermath:**\n\n\u200bI honestly don't know how to feel about it. Part of me wants to shout it from the rooftops. Part wants to cry in a corner in happiness. And the other part of me says, \"Ok ... whats next?\"\n\nThe biggest downside to the loss is the massive amount of loose skin I have remaining. I probably need to drop about 5 more pounds, 10 at the most, and the thought of more skin disgusts me. To have come this far and still not be comfortable taking off your shirt at the beach or even in the locker room kind of sucks. Unfortunately, there isn't anything that is going to fix it for me but surgery. Most of mine is covered in scar tissue left over from the many many stretch marks I developed. Much of the scar tissue has faded, but it doesn't magically revert to skin. \n\nAs an example, under my arms, from the armpit to down on my torso, it literally looks like I've been burned. I've been told by doctors there isn't anything they can do for that other than remove parts of it and tighten it up. But those parts aren't really saggy enough to have removed, I can always put muscle on under it. But around my abdomen, I will never have a V taper (much less visible abs) without having the skin removed.\n\nThen, naturally, the docs follow it up with the sticker shock of $8,000.00 - $10,000.00\u200b (or more)\u200b.\u200b Also the fact it is a very, very, painful procedure that possibly will result in small numb patches of skin around my lower torso.\u200b C'est la vie I suppose.\n\n*****************************************\n*****************************************\n\n\u200bFAQs, stuff Im just going to go ahead and answer now to save responding later because people always ask the same stuff:\n\n* Did you use surgery or chemicals?\n\n>\u200bNo. No gastric bypass or lap bands. No thermogenics, appetite suppressants or stimulants aside from caffeine. In fact, I only tried pre-work for the first time about 1.5 months ago.\u200b Sheer Strength in Cotton Candy flavor is by far my favorite and gives me the best results of the one's I have tried.\n\n* \u200bIs your penis bigger?\n\n>Ok, get the giggles over with. It's a common question, one you would assume is usually asked in a hushed whisper. But, I can't even count the number of people who so nonchalantly ask this question in public. Is it actually bigger? No. Does it LOOK bigger, absolutely. I probably gained about 3\" of visible penis\u200b. I was also told by a urologist that the higher testosterone from having lost weight can create a \"plumper\" flaccid penis as well as firmer erections.\n\n* \u200bWhich is the best diet?\n\n>Highly subjective and depends on you. Keto was very effective in the short-term, but got very boring, very fast for me. However, it kept me very strict knowing that I couldn't eat carbs. For your average person, I would recommend using keto for quick cuts when you need to strip some fat, but if you're not going to stick to the diet for at least 8 weeks, don't bother. Otherwise, just do IIFYM and keep your protein at an adequate level for your lean body mass.\u200b\n\n* Did you ever consider suicide?\n\n>I don't think a person can be as large as I was and not at least consider it, if only in passing. Luckily for me, I am tall, so I was able to carry the weight without losing significant mobility. I couldn't hike a mile uphill, but I could get across campus without feeling like I needed a ventilator.\u200b So I never really felt like my life was over, more like it was slightly impeded. But yes, there were times when it crossed my mind, a few even involved loaded weapons being close. **If you are morbidly obese, just overweight, even if you are a genetically-gifted aesthetic God/dess and you are considering suicide, PLEASE get help, there are lots of options for help, regardless of where you are in the world. You might think suicide will stop what you currently are feeling, but it also robs you of everything you could be. In the US you can call 1-800-273-8255, 911, or go to the nearest Emergency Room. Also, [here is a list of Suicide Prevention orgs in various countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines)**\n\n* \u200bWho do you see when you look in the mirror?\n\n>I don't see the \"new\" me, but I also have been small enough, long enough, that I don't see the old me either. I guess I see some amalgamation of the two ... maybe \"small-ish\" is a simplified but adequate term to use.\u200b\n\n* What would you do different?\n\n>Screw cardio, that's what. There was a period where I was doing 1-1.5 HOURS of cardio 6 days a week and after the 1st month I would stall hardcore. At the time, most people were afraid of fat and preached low-fat and cardio for weight loss. As such, if I could do it all over I would have went straight weight lifting and super light cardio. The only upshot to all the cardio I did is that I have excellent cardiac vitals now. 105/65 blood pressure and a resting pulse of ~52 bpm. If I am really rested it can drop into the upper 40's. Plus, I can out cardio the 18 and 19 year olds I currently workout with.\n\n* What isn't a con of the weight loss, but more of an annoyance?\n\n>Clothes. I can't imagine how much money I've spent on clothes or the amount of larger clothes I have given away. I desperately need new jeans right now, but I refuse to buy new ones because I know if I drop another 10lbs or some miracle happens and I can get the surgery this year, they will be useless. Also shirts ... Large for the Upper Torso, XL for the lower spare tire of skin, guess which size wins out? XL, every time. So I look like 5lbs of flour in a 10lbs sack on my upper torso and 11lbs of flour in the same 10lbs sack on my lower.\n\n* Do you do anything weight loss related with your experience?\n\n>I am a non-practicing psychotherapist/counselor. One of my goals in 2017 is to finally set up shop as a weight loss/sports/eating disorder counselor. Perhaps even look into providing support for new bariatric patients.\n\n* What's next?\n\n>First I need to get my shoulder healed up. I went from an Incline Press of 185lbs for reps to basically feeling like the bar is going to crush me within a day. I have a friend who is a personal trainer, we trade skills ... I get workout/form help from him and he gets diet/macro help from me. He and I have been discussing where to go next for me. First of all, I need to get my upper body strength back, 12/31 was 13 weeks since the injury so I've lost a lot of size, especially in my shoulders. Once I get back to where I was, I'd like to continue on the path to wherever it might lead. I doubt I will ever compete or anything, too damn old for that now, but as they say ... age is just a number. I always wanted to do the Mammoth Cave trog tour, but even after dropping 200lbs I've realized my normal chest size is beyond their max diameter, oh well. I guess, if I had to name something I'd like to do off the top of my head, I'd like to climb a mountain. Maybe Mt. Elbert or Rainier?\u200b Something with proper snow and requires a bit of technical climbing.\u200b I'v\u200be \u200balways been a bit of an armchair mountaineer. \n\n* Any tips or tricks?\n\n>Crockpots. Get 2 of them and constantly be using them. You can have pre-measured, hot food, anytime of day with maybe 20 minutes prep each night. Plan you crock pot meal so that you can eat the entire thing, throw it in around 10pm and cook overnight on Low. I do chicken breasts and beans (kidney, black, chili, or green beans for lower calories) alot, or even chicken/beef chilis, or just slow cook a ton of meat to use for other stuff. You can also opt to make extra then freeze/refrigerate leftovers as you go to build up a small selection of take-along meals.\n\n\u200bIf anyone has any other questions or comments feel free to ask.\u200b\n\nEDIT: *changed Senior to Junior, Senior year was when I started.\n\nEDIT 2: I really want to keep responding to everyone's comments but Im about to pass out. I'll try to respond to everyone tomorrow.\n\nEDIT 3: Some people have questioned my height based on the girl standing next to me in one photo. 1. She was a college basketball player, she is abnormally tall. 2. Maths ... Check the wall behind us. Standard building block height in the US is 8\" high. There is exactly 9 rows of blocks from feet to the top of my head, that is 72\" (6') before even adding in mortar seam height.

I do have an Instagram (**@alwaysbulking42**) if you want to follow!\n\nSo how did I do it? Let's go down each transformation.\n\n> 267lbs to 167lbs in Two Years\n\nSo in 8th grade I was 267lbs and pretty damn disgusted by myself. I was playing basketball but I would break into a sweat in no time. I had tried diets that my parents put me on before, and I couldn't stick with anything. Finally, my aunt went on a low carb-like diet and lost 10lbs in the first week (mind you - I was 13 at the time - I figured this was REAL weight lost, not water weight), and 12lbs in the first two weeks total. \n\nI figured hey, I could do this. The diet itself was not an Atkins style diet - it actually required lean meats as well, you couldn't eat bacon, or fatty hamburger meat, or fatty fish. My general weekly diet was unlimited amounts of lean protein week 1, then week 2 unlimited amounts of lean protein and non-starchy carbs (think tomatoes, zucchini, cucumber, lettuce, etc). \n\nYou alternated that until you hit your weight loss goal, then you slowly brought carbs and all the other foods back in that you weren't eating to get used to including them in your diet once more. I lost 100lbs doing this and it was pretty simple. The book itself was in French, and my parents read the entire thing front to back, translated the rules for me, and helped me learn to cook for myself so I could make sure I stuck with it even if they were away for work (and that I am truly appreciative of).\n\nI did not really work out - actually, the summer between 8th grade and highschool I had a physical labor job picking horse manure out of stalls all summer which probably helped me lose weight. There was no secret sauce here - it was all diet.\n\n> 167 to 220 in 4 years\n\nHere it was a bit different. I played sports year round in highschool and put size on because of that. I was eating a normal diet (aka back to carbs etc) but I wasn't strict on anything aside from just avoiding junk food. By senior year of high school I was close to 200lbs and pretty lean (not amazingly lean, definitely fatter than my 220lb college picture, but not in bad shape considering I never lifted). Note - I would KILL for those teenager hormones again. You look at weights and put size on :(\n\nIn college I started lifting finally at the end of Freshman year. I got into the idea of powerlifting, then did nothing during the summer (working instead), and got back to college and lifted again. My programming for two years was a simple progressive loading 5x5. I would do 3x a week, and did C25K 3x a week, for 6 days total. If I knew it would be a short week, I threw C25K in after my 5x5 day\n\n* 5x5 Breakdown\n\nNot that it needs MUCH explanation, but I did 5x5 in a pretty straightforward manner:\n\n**DAY A**\n\nSquat\n\nBench\n\nChinUps\n\n**Day B**\n\nDeadlift\n\nOverhead Press\n\nBarbell Row\n\nFor Squat and Deadlift I started at 135lbs and added 10lbs each time I succeeded, and upper body lifts I started with the bar and added 5 (10 for the bench until I broke 135). Pullups I needed to do assisted pullups and used all sorts of variants. I lifted 3x a week, alternating Day A and Day B.\n\nAfter two years I competed in a powerlifting meet and pulled a 501lb Deadlift, a 267lb bench with a pause, and a 365lb squat or so (I had an issue with my hip that flared up every now and then and limited my squat training)\n\n> 220 to Football Size (walked on at 265, final playing weight at 285)\n\nI decided to try out for my school's D1-AA football team in May, as a Junior, entering my senior year. I was sitting at 230lbs, and figured if I was strong and fast enough I would have a chance.\n\nI worked my ass off doing 2-a-days, basically continuing my 5x5 programming 2x a week and doing oly lifts the 3rd day. I was eating around 3500-4000 calories a day and gaining weight very fast (it wasn't until recently that my TDEE has finally started to make sense). I was doing a lot of plyometrics training, running, battle rope, medicine ball swings, running routes/receiver drills, LB drills of all sorts, running 40s, and a whole bunch of other crap.\n\nI ended the summer at 265 and in pretty decent shape for that weight, and asked the coach for a shot. He laughed at me, said \"this is a D1-AA team, you think you can walk on with 0 football experience?\" which made me laugh and I said \"Well, I hope to!\"\n\nI ended up running some decent 40s (all were under 4.75s during the summer), and they gave me a shot. Only issue was we had about 12 linebackers and they slotted me into Nose and I needed to gain weight (more mass is good in Football!). \n\nFor this stage I followed our Strength Coach's programming. That was a lot of \"safer\" lifts than what I was doing - power cleans, DB snatches, trap bar deadlifts, squats, etc. but not as much pure deadlifting and 1RMs. It definitely worked - I got waaaay stronger, and pulled a trap bar 555lb Deadlift for 3. During this time my squat went up to 445, normal deadlift was 565, and bench was 355 touch and go.\n\n> 298 and Fat\n\nSo after football ended I immediately started losing weight. I was actually down to 275, down about 20lbs from my heaviest weigh in. I graduated college, stoked about my new job that I was starting that August, and slowly trailed down to 265. In August, I got news that my position was closed and they could no longer higher me due to policy reasons (it was at a Spanish bank; Spanish labor laws changed allegedly and they could only offer me a position if I was a 4 year undergrad student at a Spanish U). \n\nRegardless, I started looking for another job and couldn't find one at all. They all asked the same question - why didn't I have a job out of college? Anyway, that threw me down into a spiral of self-loathing and I ballooned right back up to 298 at my peak (I might have been even heavier, I didn't want to weigh myself at times). I stayed at that weight for close to 2 years.\n\nThe turning point for me was when I went to Cancun with a few friends, everyone was running around and I was working on keeping up, and then I looked down at myself and thought I was ridiculously fat and I couldn't do that.\n\nI said fuck this and started a Ketogenic diet again because for bulk weightloss I think it has to be the best thing out there. I did a different version than from when I was a kid; this time it had more fat (I learned about proteins taking you out of ketosis if you eat too much), and a diversified source of low-carb veggies. I got ketostix and went back to counting calories like I did in college.\n\nThe weight was melting off, but I had no strength - I hadn't trained strength at all in college. I lost weight at a pretty astounding rate and in only a little over a year I lost 80lbs, from 298 to 216.7.\n\nMy lifting routine was all light DB work and high levels of cardio and LISS. Nothing exciting - just getting in the gym to keep muscle mass as much as possible. My back was shot and my knees were aching so I didn't squat or deadlift much.\n\n> 216 to 230 Range\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5wr9w4/m2662_300lb220lbs_80lbs_lost_and_subsequent/ This can all be found here. I detailed it pretty extensively - I went back to powerlifting. I started off doing 5x5 then went to 3x5, then 3x3, and progressively worked on getting stronger. I actually got down to a 4.58s 40yd dash as well which was always a goal of mine (to get under 4.6).\n\nI now currently do 5/3/1 and added in First Set Last as a hypertrophy block.\n\nDiet is simple: I shoot for 200+g of protein (usually chicken thigh or strip steak), and fill in the rest. I get most of my sugary carbs around workout (sip one protein shake with half a scoop of highly branched cyclic dextrin during workout, and another right after), and the rest is vegetables and then a cookie or some other type of sweet treat after my main meal. I eat fewer than 3300 calories per day at the moment and am working on a slow slow cut (I'm a bit puffier than in the last photo)\n\n> Ending Thoughts\n\nI had a weird path throughout this time, but now I've gotten a lot more fit and learned a bunch along the way. It's not easy, but you have to hold *yourself* accountable for these changes. I had a low TDEE (measured out to be around 2800 calories working out 6x a week at 260lbs) and I still managed to cut weight. I am sitting at around a 3300 calorie per day TDEE currently at 230 and working out less than I was when losing weight\n\nUltimately, the way a friend recently said it about her cut (as a bodybuilder) was \"I want this burger right now more than I want to be lean in 3 months\" and I realized I made that mental switch in my lifestyle choices. I wanted to be lean in a year more than I wanted that burger, or popeyes, or alcoholic drink right then.\n\nTruthfully, the real reason I even put all these photos together is because from August until about a month ago I was dreading going to the gym and hated it, but I used these photos as a reminder for why I needed to keep up my routine\n\nI've kept the weight off for nearly two years, and I honestly have to take it one week at a time to make sure I stay this weight if not lighter\n\nI don't talk much about diet at the moment on my Instagram but I have a powerlifting focused one :) **@alwaysbulking42** if you want to follow!", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Male/27/6'2/230lbs - Going from Fat (267lbs) to Thin (167lbs) to Muscular (220lbs) to Fat (298lbs) to Muscularish (230lbs)", "post_ups": 4084, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7twg27/male2762230lbs_going_from_fat_267lbs_to_thin/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:10.322922", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "aegluc", "post_created_utc": 1453390454.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1453401474.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "420gpj", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 1469, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 4078, "post_selftext": "I'm 30 and I've been lifting consistently for the past 4-5 years with some breaks.

After spending most of my life being fat, and a point of hitting rock bottom, I finally got my shit together. While I still have some ways to go, I'm so happy that most of this journey is done with.\n\n Please don't wait to lose weight. I feel 100 times better than I ever did when I was at 300lbs mentally and physically. The only thing that awaited me with that lifestyle was diabetes, hypertension, and a shorter time on this earth. Girls look at me now, I don't worry about chairs creaking as I sit down, and overall I have way more confidence than ever before.\n\n\n\nI lost a lot of weight through intermittent fasting and eating keto. For workout I was on ICF but now do a modified version of coolcicada's PPL routine.\n\n\nWE'RE ALL GONNA MAKE IT!\n\n\n**EDIT to fix post for rules**\n\n#WORK OUT REGIMENT\n\n\n**PUSH**\n\nBenchpress - 3x5 185\n\nOverhead press - 3x5 115\n\nIncline Bench - 3x5 135\n\nDumbbell side lateral raises - 3x10 25\n\nDumbbell straight lateral raises - 3x10 25 or 20 if I'm weak\n\nRope Pushdowns - 3x10 (machine at gym is resistance based so Idk the weight)\n\nOverhead dumbbell extension - 3x10 35\n\nShrugs - 3x10 275\n\n**PULL**\n\nChin-ups - 3x10 bodyweight\n\nBent over row - 3x5 135\n\nLat pull down - 3x10 130\n\nSeated row - 3x10 130\n\nFacepulls - 3x10 70\n\nPreacher curls - 3x10 170 (on machine, then I do a dead set to get really pumped, not sure if that's what it's called but I start at 170 and do as many reps as I can, when I fail I drop 20 lbs and repeat until no more weight)\n\nT-Bar row - 3x10 50-75, i'm a pussy on this one\n\n**LEGS**\n\nLegs I keep very short but very grueling (for me at least)\n\nSquats - 5x5 225 (I have shit form on squats so hurt myself so I do hack squats if my legs are messed up.)\n\nHack Squats (if not doing Squats) - 5x5 3 plates, don't know the weight of the sled\n\nDeadlift - 1x5 315, just hit one rep max of 405!\n\nLeg press - 3x8 450\n\nStanding calf raises - 3xfailure 250\n\nSeated calf raises - 3xfailure 75\n\nI also do 3x15 crunches at the end of every workout day. Not sure if they're crunches, you basically lift yourself by your forearms and raise your legs up to your chest.\n\nNo strength loss, but slow gains.\n\n#Diet\n\nIntermittent Fasting and eating Keto were the methods used for this weight loss. Starting out I only ate one meal a day at dinner time, whatever I wanted. I chose this method because I had an unhealthy relationship with food and liked a lot of sweets. I wanted a method of dieting that could control caloric intake while still allowing me to eat whatever I wanted, yet still be satisfied. Following this method, trying to eat a 1500-2000kcal meal was difficult so I knew I couldn't OVEREAT.\n\n\nLater on, I ate Keto and found that I could eat very low in calories without being hungry and still be satisfied. For the last 50 lbs I didn't count calories at all, I simply ate less than 20g of Carbs and stayed away from sugar. Right now I still eat Keto, I would like to get to 195 before I start bulking but I would guess that I eat around 1700kcal a day. \n\n\n**Typical meal** \n\nBreakfast would have two Eggs, 5-7 slices of bacon and a protein shake\nDon't really eat lunch, I usually have some turkey jerky or cheese as a snack.\nDinner I typically eat Chicken breast (or fish or hamburger), Tuna, Cheese, maybe eggs, and a protein shake.\n\n\nThere are a ton of great recipes on /r/keto for you to look at. I also eat some celery and nuts but I really stick to meats. The great part about this diet is how filling all the food is. After dinner I simply have no interest in snacking.\n\n\n**Supplements**\n\n10g Whey before workouts\n\nMen's multivitamin\n\n2 Caffeine Pills before workout\n\n\n**EDIT: thanks a lot for all the support guys. It really does mean a lot to me. I will answer any questions throughout the day if you have any. THANKS SO MUCH!**\n\n\n**EDIT 2: I'm getting a lot of questions that I want to answer with this edit. First off I only did my workout which is listed for very specific reasons, if you want to get into lifting, don't do that. Read below.**\n\n\n\n#Motivation\n\n\nA lot of people have surprisingly asked me about this. The typical message is to the tune of \"I really want to lose weight or look better, but I have trouble taking the first step.\" The one thing I can tell you is that almost everyone who is lifting weights in the gym now started for a completely different reason. Most people start working out for the (wrong) assumption it will help them lose weight. They have dreams of being envied, of having a rock-hard body that ladies swoon for, or becoming something other than the scrawny kid they've been their whole life. I know that was the case for me. I wasn't getting laid and boy did I have an appetite for women. \n\n\nBut something happens within the first few months of lifting seriously. You start to notice progress, not just superficial progress, but strength. Suddenly you attempt a deadlift at a weight you couldn't even get off the ground before, and there you are, fully extended with the weight held firmly in your hands. Your muscles will be pumped full of blood and feel like they're about to rip through your skin. It's a feeling that cannot be adequately described with words and this is my advice to you. **Use whatever motivates you now to get into the gym and stick it out, because that motivation will change.** The truth is, it will take a long time to have a body that belongs on a magazine cover. If this is your main goal, you will fail simply because it takes too long to reach it. But when you come to appreciate strength and realize you can become stronger (if even only a little bit) each month, you will keep coming back.\n\n\n#What & How should I eat?\n\n\nI'm a big fan of quotes so I apologize in advance. If you don't remember anything I'm about to say, remember these two:\n\n\n>*\"You cannot outrun a bad diet\"*\n\n\n>*\"Weight loss is 95% diet\"*\n\n\nA lot of people set themselves up to fail as soon as they start wanting to lose weight. They see a post like mine and think \"I want to do that, I'm going to lose this weight.\" They then create a plan which requires herculean willpower. They're going to cut calories by half and train everyday until they're skinny. Inevitably they fail, binge the weight back on, and repeat. Even though this pattern is very apparent with people we know in our lives, many simply fail to recognize it. How many times have your family members or friends gone on a diet and failed? We all know more than one person who has. It's surprisingly common. \n\n\nThe reason for this is what I chalk up to ignorance, especially with people that others look for guidance. One thing I want to make very clear, *please understand this*, you can lose weight by working out 6 times a week and simply by eating less. You can also cross the ocean in a canoe instead of a plane. What is so difficult about dieting and nutrition is that many people can see results through inefficient means. Our bodies are complex machines of nature but yet we like to attribute weight loss down to simple axioms like Calories in, Calories out. When we see someone who has results we think they must be doing something right, and suddenly the guy who read Starting Strength one time and goes on the bodybuilding.com forums feels like he is the nutrition guru. \n\n\nOne thing that really irks me is exactly Calories In, Calories Out. Of course calories matter, but not in the way people think. A lot of people become VERY DEFENSIVE about their little rule, if someone loses weight on a caloric surplus they're lying. If they're not losing weight on a deficit, they're not just stalling, they're lying. These same people that tell you that only calories matter are also the same people that will tell you there is a difference between a clean & dirty bulk, that a carb-refeed doesn't simply mean eating a pizza, and that you should eat more protein for muscle growth. We know that fat accumulation has other factors than just calories. All I'm asking, is it so hard to believe macro-nutrients play a part of losing weight? Is it such a stretch to believe we maybe evolved to digest some food better than others? I don't think it's a radical proposal. \n\n\nMany people can see results by simply cutting calories. When we do this, we tend to eat healthier foods anyway. We tend to stop eating fast food and keep track of what we eat. Try this out and see if it works for you, otherwise you should try a diet that makes it very hard to overeat. I for one don't track calories at all. I am currently on a intermittent fasting regiment where I only eat from 4-12 every day. It is extremely hard to overeat when you're devouring only one or two huge meals. I tend to mostly eat lean meat which is very filling but I also eat bread and even ice cream or pizza when I feel like it. I really have to force myself to eat to get to a surplus, something most people easily do each day. Another easy way to control dieting is keto because the food is so filling, you rarely feel hungry and the calories are pretty low. Both of these lifestyles allow your body to spend more time burning fat. \n\n\nKeep an eye out for the type of people that do certain diets and learn from them. If you go to /r/keto for example, most people seem to have a sweet tooth or a binge eating problem that they effectively control through the diet. When they fall off the wagon, they gain a lot of weight back. I don't have these problems so I lost a good amount of fat, regained the water weight from the glycogen coming back into my muscles, but have been losing more weight since then.\n\n\n This is why it is important to take notice of when you tend to eat, what you crave, and ask yourself why you have gained weight in the first place. I had a terrible diet, where I ate nothing but fast food and pizza during the week. It seems so apparent now how much I was screwing up, but I just didn't really care at the time. I was in denial. Don't be like me. Other people I know have mental blocks that keep them plump like binge eating disorder. If you have a mental issue with food, you need to recognize the thoughts and feelings that lead up to the unhealthy behavior. \n \n \n ##How should I work out?\n \n \n  If you're read the diet portion of this, we already know that lifting weights will not help you lose weight (efficiently at least). So if you're working out you should be after two things, which are actually one thing, muscle and strength. [You can read this article](http://strengtheory.com/the-new-approach-to-training-volume/) which will tell you basically one thing, bodybuilding is powerlifting and powerlifting is bodybuilding. If you work hard and continually push yourself, muscle will grow. You will see results.\n \n \n >\"Good artists copy, great artists steal\" - http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/03/06/artists-steal/\n \n look at that link and read how many great people have used this advice. Not one piece of advice has helped me in more parts of life than this. When we steal, we take something and make it our own. When we want to build our muscle, we look at those who inspire us, people who are champions. We then must do what they do and tailor it to fit our own bodies. \n \n \n Let's look at popular training methods that are used by people interested in strength training, from beginners to advanced lifters. \n \n \n [ICF 5x5](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/jason-blaha-ice-cream-fitness-5x5-novice-workout) \n \n \n [Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.com/get-started)\n \n \n [StrongLifts 5x5](http://stronglifts.com/5x5/)\n \n \n [The Texas Method](https://www.t-nation.com/training/texas-method)\n \n \n [Madcow 5x5](http://stronglifts.com/madcow-5x5-training-programs/)\n \n\n One thing you'll notice is that all of these programs are very similar. All of them have you only work out three days a week and some only three exercises a day. In our lives we are often erroneously taught that time = results. A novice might look at these programs and think \"my cousin Chad spends 2 hours a day in the gym, 6 days a week and he's jacked!\" but once again we come back to my analogy. You can cross the ocean in a canoe or in a plane. It's your choice. Do you think [Martin Berkhan](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dtaWqzV6d7M/SuMlTBIBAZI/AAAAAAAAAfI/2q8FdTPNy0k/s320/DSC00316.JPG) or [Mark Rippetoe](http://www.directlyfitness.com/store/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mark-rippletoe.jpg) look weak? Mark created starting strength which is what a lot of the programs above are based on. \n \n \n These people understand the biology of the human body. Compound lifts like Bench Press, Squats, and Deadlifts work your whole body and build muscle like no other.

My weight peaked at 325lbs and the doctor told me that I could effectively take 20 years off of my life expectancy if I didn't make dramatic life changes. I lost 130lbs by doing 5 workouts per week as follows:\n\n* Monday: Cardio \n* Tuesday: Upper body strength\n* Wednesday: Cardio\n* Thursday: Lower body strength\n* Friday: Cardio\n\nFor my cardio I always did alternating intervals of high and low resistance, switching every 4 minutes for an average of 45 to 60 minutes per session. I'd also be sure to change up the mean of cardio about every two weeks. So for example, I'd do the elliptical for 2 weeks and then switch to stairmaster for 2 weeks, etc.\n\nFor my weight loss diet I always stuck to lean meats, mostly chicken, and fresh fruits and veggies. I didn't scrutinize my calorie count but I eyeballed it to where I'd get around 2,000 per day.\n\n\nOnce I reached a weight of around 195lbs using this routine I switched to a strength training regimen that has gotten me to my current weight of 225lbs (I am 6'4\" btw, that's why the number is a bit higher than my weight actually looks). Here is my routine:\n\n* Monday: Chest, Tris, Shoulders\n* Tuesday: Back, Bis\n* Wednesday: Abs, Legs\n* Thursday: Heavy lifts, 20 min elliptical and HIIT sprints on treadmill\n* I also try to walk at night and on the weekends.\n\nI maintain at around 3,000 calories on lifting days eating (40p/40c/20f) and around 2,500 calories on off days eating (40p/20c/40/f)\n\nMy wife lost her weight more recently than I did. She had gotten up to 165+ pounds and decided to change her lifestyle in an to get healthy and feel better about how she thought she looked. She is now around 120lbs @ 5'5\" and sticks to mostly a vegan diet. She fell in love with running and typically runs the equivalent of a 5k race (3.1 miles) around 4-5 days a week and does body weight exercises in between. She ate 1,200 calories per day while she was losing her weight and now eats around 1,500 calories per day to maintain.\n\nIt's been a lot of work but our lives have dramatically improved and we feel so much better! Let us know if you have any questions!\n\nEdit: Thanks SO much for the positive comments :) I'm so happy that some of y'all are inspired by our work.

My legs can hold some serious weight bro)\n\n**After Picture Weight:** Currently sitting at 164 pounds. \n\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**Lifts**\n\nDisclaimer: I didn't log weights until I started taking PPL seriously, so the starting weight may not be exact, but I'm confident that this is *pretty* close.\n\nI had never lifted a weight before starting out, so my lifts were overall very weak to start with.\n\n**Bench (5X5):** 40lbs - 180lbs\n\n**Squat (3X5):** 95lbs - 200lbs \n\n**Overhead Press (5X5):** 30lbs(I think?) - 120lbs\n\n**Deadlift (1X5):** 135lbs - 275lbs\n\n**Rows (5X5):** 50lbs - 160lbs\n\nI actually did 5X5 for squats for a while, because I wasn't paying attention and didn't realize it was supposed to be 3X5 at first.  Once I started over on my squats I did the proper 3X5 and it's been climbing since then.\n\nSome might call into question why my squat and deadlift are so low.  Well, because I didn't do that shit for way too long. \n\n With squats in particular, I got some nasty tendentious in my hip, and had to build back up to my 200 squat slowly from 120 again.  I finally climbed back up to 200 this past week, and my hip feels just fine.  200 is also feeling pretty easy right now, so I'm confident that it will rise to a more \"normal\" squat for my size easily.\n\n For deadlifts, I was afraid I'd snap my back in half originally, and just felt like I could skip them (I'd slap \"past me\" if I could).  I'm still heavily focused on form, and tend to drop the weight once my back shows any sign of curling.  I'm deadlifting 275 currently, but can probably do a bit more once I lock down my form.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Program: October 2016 - Jaunary 2017**\n\nFrom October 2016 until January I fucked around with a half-assed brosplit.  I was cutting heavily at the time (~1.5 pounds a week on average).\n\nLifting was *entirely* new to me, so I learned from a coworker at the time, who praised his bro-split routine, and I fully embraced it.  I worked 3 days a week, meandering around the gym and just sort of picking heavy shit up.\n\n**Program: January 2017 - March 2017**\n\nThis is when I came across metallicadpa's ppl routine on this subreddit.  I decided to do a half-assed version of it with dumb bells and continued to kinda fuck around with *mostly* working out 6 days a week.  I didn't do deadlifts or squats, because I wasn't confident in deadlifts and felt like leg press was a substitute for squats.  Yeah, I know.\n\nI followed the rest of the program's lifts, but wasn't doing the program.  I substituted barbell exercises with dumb bells, because I was more comfortable that way, and I wasn't keeping track of my lifts at all.  Pro Tip: don't do that.\n\nTowards the end here, I started dead-lifting.  I started with 135 pounds, and genuinely couldn't go up in weight.  My lower back and hamstrings were way too weak.  \n\n**Program: March 2017 - Current**\n\nI decided to get my shit together and ACTUALLY do the PPL routine.  I got myself a little book, logged my weights, and progressed with barbell exercises like I should.  I followed, and still follow the program to a tee now.  Within two weeks I felt a huge difference in strength.\n\nThis is also when I started my first bulk.  I cut 38 pounds of fat, and could have gone a little further, but I was pretty excited to start my first bulk.  I bulked from March until early July and went from 158lbs - 169lbs.  I originally planned to bulk until October, and then cut for Summer of 2018, but I got a girlfriend - and she foiled my plans.  I'm currently cutting some body fat for a month or two before I begin lean bulking through Fall and Winter.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Diet**\n\nAt first I wanted to blame my metabolism for my initial weight gain (in reality it was from getting my first desk job and not changing the way I ate).  I learned through this subreddit and the wiki - rather quickly - that I was being a damned fool.  \n\nI initially cut my calories by limiting my meals to sandwiches and frozen burritos every day.  That's literally all I ate for 3 months.  I initially justified this because it was dirt cheap and effective for weight loss.  I didn't take into account that: \n\n1. Eating a nutritionally void diet makes you feel pretty awful \n2. You can get nutrition for cheap\n3. You can eat more food if you eat less calorie dense foods (go figure)\n\nAfter 3 months of my awful diet, I switched over to a strict meal plan that I still generally follow to this day.  I eat:\n\n\n* Protein Shake (whey, whole milk and peanut butter - tastes great with coffee concentrate if you have it)\n\n* Chicken, Broccoli, Rice\n\n* Beef and Eggs\n\n* And if I'm feeling crazy, sometimes avocado and/or cottage cheese\n\nAnd that's about it.  I eat the same thing just about every single day, and I enjoy it.  The lack of variety doesn't bother me, though I still eat other things on the weekends to enjoy my food a bit more with my friends and family.  \n\nThe main reason for my ridiculously cheap meal plan is that I'm one frugal mother-fucker, and this keeps my grocery bill about as cheap for complete nutrition as you can get.  \n\nThis diet doesn't include fish, so I supplement with fish oil.  I take animal (that's the brand - not talking about animal shaped gummies, here lol) multivitamins as well, just to ensure that I'm not missing out on any minerals or vitamins.  \n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**Further Ramblings**\n\nI actually posted my progress on here before: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5u1icy/my_5_month_transformation_progress/\n\nYou'll notice I get called out for my lifts seeming a bit odd when people asked for them.  That's because I wasn't logging anything and just kinda guessed where I thought things were at.  It helped me realize I still wasn't doing things optimally, and I'm sure I still have a lot to learn.\n\n> How do you prepare your food?\n\nFor the shake, I blend up the ingredients in a shake bottle with a lid attachment - so similar to a bullet.  Takes me less than a couple minutes to whip up, chug, and clean.  Laziest breakfast ever.\n\nFor the chicken and broccoli, I throw that shit in the oven and watch netflix for 20 minutes, take out the broccoli, and then take out the chicken after 45 minutes.  \n\nI make a shit ton of rice every week or so in roughly 10 minutes, and then everything goes in the fridge/freezer. \n\nI toss my lunch foods into meal prep containers, and then I'm done.\n\n> How is this 1 year of progress if you started lifting in October?\n\nI started dieting in July last year, and went to the gym a few times, but I didn't really try and take lifting seriously until October.  \n\n> how much food do you eat?\n\nThat changes depending on my current goal.  I'm currently eating around 1800-2000 calories a day on a cut, and while bulking I was eating around 2400-2600 calories a day.\n\n> How about seasoning?\n\nSome \"kickin' chicken\" seasoning from walmart + copious amounts of hot sauce for the chicken, and then I cover my broccoli with steak seasoning (sounds weird but it's tasty as fuck).  \n\nFor the beef and eggs, I just use salt, pepper, and you guessed it - more hot sauce.\n\n> Your previous post didn't have rice in the meal plan\n\nI actually didn't add the rice until I started my bulk, and so I was effectively on a keto diet.  Adding rice made a massive difference in my overall energy.  I'll never go back to low carb.  I didn't realize how much energy I was missing out on until I re-introduced them.\n\n> What are your long term fitness goals?\n\nThis goal shifts a lot.  At first, I just didn't want to be fat.  Now, I wanna look as good as I can with my clothes off.  I think I'm going to want to improve my cardiovascular fitness as well, because I currently don't do any cardio whatsoever.  \n\nOnce my linear progression stalls (my squat  and bench are still steadily climbing) I'll probably switch to 5/3/1\n\n> Why don't you do cardio?\n\nDon't feel like it. \n\n> It's good for you\n\nI know.  I'll step up my cardio game at some point.\n\n> How about creatine?\n\nI add creatine to my shake every morning\n\n> Preworkout?\n\nOnce in a blue moon I'll take it if I'm feeling fog-headed and don't have work the next day, but generally I don't feel like I need it.  Warmups are usually enough to get my ready to lift at my best.\n\n> What do you do for warmups?\n\nI usually just do 5-10 reps with really low weight to get the blood moving.  If that doesn't get me going, I'll add a little weight before tackling my big lift.  \n\n> What about your progress on your legs and back?\n\nI sadly never took progress photos of either, but I can take a shot of my back and legs and add it to the album, if people are curious.\n\n> Why are your starting lifts so low?  Were you *really* that weak?\n\nNo, probably not, but these were the numbers I started with.  Keep in mind, I was completely new and learning proper form from scratch here while trying to move up in weight/reps every day, so these weights seemed to work for me at the time.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TL;DR** I read the wiki and good things happened.

This is my easy mode meal prep, feel free to swap ingredients however you want. I am posting this more or less as a newbie guide to follow for those who are struggling to find a way to fix a meal that meets the holy trinity of being cheap, healthy, and easy. This isn't perfect, but what is? Have fun with it and make it your own.    \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThings you might want to consider purchasing BEFORE you begin your meal prep journey(these are what I use):   \n\n&nbsp;\n \n\n[A scale](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CM6TVI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  \n[Microwavable multi-use plastic containers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TBMW6LO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAccording to MyFitnessPal the macros for this batch:   \n**495 calories  \n59g carbs  \n4g fat  \n56g protein**    \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nPS:I threw in a LOT of broccoli so the cals are on the high end, but you don't have to. Do whatever you want homie. Usually my meals are in the 330-400 cal range.    \n\n&nbsp;\n \n\nStep one: Shopping(time to pull out your hard earned pennies)  \nFor the sake of simplicity I am going to assume you already have some basic spices, cookware, and at least *ramen-making level culinary skills.* If you don't that's fine, but you'll have to figure that shit out on your own. I'm not going to do everything for you.      \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBelow is the stuff I had to pick up from the store.. I was on a time crunch so I kind of just grabbed stuff. I change it up every time, but the important things to always grab are a lean protein (I always use chicken breast), good veggies that have a lot of fiber(Frozen, fresh, canned, whatever you feel like man.), and either brown rice or quinoa.    \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n3lbs chicken breast=2.99/lb=$8.97  \nOne big yellow onion=$1.31  \nRaw nonorganic Broccoli=3.28lbs= $3.24   (yeah nonorganic... I'm cheap)  \nOrange peppers=4/$5= $5  \nOne box of brown rice=1.29  \nAdd it all up...**19.81**  \n7 big meals for just under 20 bucks ...not terrible when you consider it's **2.83** a pop. If you aren't in the mood for a ton of veggies you can easily omit the peppers and onions and magically you are at **1.92** per meal!   Even better! Cheaper gainz! Huzzah!    \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nStep two: Go home.   \nStep three: Pre-heat the oven to 350.  \nStep four: Start chopping. Seriously. Chop like your life depended on it. I chopped up the broccoli, the peppers, the onions, and then the chicken. Weigh your ingredients now before you cook them, it's easier and later you can just divide your totals by the amount of containers you will equally fill and you have an easy way to get your macros. Much easier than weighing each container as you scoop stuff into it. Who cares if your containers vary slightly in size? It'll average out over the next few days.  &nbsp;\nThe rest of these steps can be done simultaneously or in whatever order you feel like. Just prioritize starting the chicken and the rice before the veggies and it should all finish about the same time.    \n\n&nbsp;\n\nStep five: Get out a baking dish, something that can fit all that chopped up chicken that you're about to cook. Line it with foil, and fill it with your chicken. Season that shit up and mix it around. I used garlic powder, salt, pepper, and some generic poultry seasoning. Use whatever you want. When your oven is done preheating, throw your chicken in the oven. Let it cook about 30 minutes. Check it every 5-10 after that, cutting into it and making sure there are no pink parts left.  \nStep six: Follow the directions on the boxed brown rice. It's easy.  \nStep seven: Grab a large pan with a lid THAT FITS(trust me, it's pretty important) and throw all your broccoli in there with 2-3 cups of water. Put it on the stove and crank it up to high. When it starts boiling turn down the heat and put the lid on it. Cook/steam the broccoli to desired texture.  \nStep eight: Fry up your chopped onions and peppers in medium sized pan on medium-high heat.(I didn't use any oil but you can) You can throw in garlic powder or extra seasonings if you like. I did. It's done when the onions look glassy and the peppers are soft.    \n\n&nbsp;\n\nStep nine: Woohoo! You made it! The fun part! Now that everything is cooked to perfection you can put everything into your containers. I had seven on hand so this will be seven meals for me. I like to start with the rice and layer the chicken broccoli/veggies on top. I do this so I have to eat all the veggies before getting to the \"good stuff.\"   \nStep ten: I drizzled hot sauce and soy sauce on top of each.  \nStep eleven: Pack it up, put it away, wash your dishes, and go calculate your macros. Easy peasey. You are done. Congrats. It should look something like [this](http://imgur.com/a/4jlJp)    \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nTLDR: [Pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/4jlJp) 2-3 bucks a meal depending on how you make it, with good macros.(at least I think so)\n \n\nObligatory edit:  This is not my only source of nutrition, and I do not recommend ONLY eating this meal as a diet. I eat these mostly for lunch and or dinner. I personally am doing iffym with roughly a 45c30p25f split on a small caloric deficit, but that doesn't matter. Make it work for you. :-) \n\nEdit 2: whoa this got a much bigger response than I anticipated. If there is interest I can make a more detailed post explaining how I track macros, more meal ideas, ideas on making the meals better fit your macros and general advice on meal prep.  \n\nEdit 3: gold!!! Thank you anonymous super hero, I am glad you enjoyed my post. Hope it helps.:-)   \nAlso if you guys look in the comments several users have recreated their version of the meal and posted their costs, pictures, etc. I recommend checking them out for addition inspiration and advice.  \nEdit 4: LAST one. A lot of people are still messaging me for advice on a wide range of things. While I am more than happy to answer specific questions I recently read a book that answers almost all the questions I've gotten. Bigger leaner stronger by Michael Matthews. I bought the ebook from amazon on sale for 99 cents and after reading it would have gladly paid $30+ for it. Fantastic read, backed by countless studies. Can't recommend it enough.(no I am not affiliated with him in any way, I am just a fan)\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Meal prep so easy a caveman can do it(newbie guide)", "post_ups": 3948, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/368cn2/meal_prep_so_easy_a_caveman_can_do_itnewbie_guide/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:10.322922", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Thats_Justice", "post_created_utc": 1426092566.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1426094746.0, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2yozrg", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 424, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3943, "post_selftext": "You can find my previous 101 posts right here:\n\n[Biceps 101: An Anatomical Guide to Training](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2wcaoi/biceps_101_an_anatomical_guide_to_training/)\n\n[Triceps 101: An Anatomical Guide to Training](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2x4iwj/triceps_101_an_anatomical_guide_to_training/)\n\n[Deltoids 101: An Anatomical Guide to Training](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2xxa7l/deltoids_101_an_anatomical_guide_to_training/)\n\n>**ANATOMY**\n\n>The back is composed of a lot of muscles. To simplify things, I\u2019m going to split the back into three sections; the [trapezius/traps](http://imgur.com/AVI7TQL), the [upper back](http://imgur.com/3ph5vSB), and the [latissimus dorsi/lats](http://imgur.com/Ap9WIS0)  (lower back will be covered under the core blog).\n\n>*TRAPS*\n\n>* Originate (start) on the [C7- T12 vertebrae](http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/imgapr03/HistPaper03_Fig1.jpg) \n\n>* Insert (attach) on the lateral aspect of the clavicle (collar bone), and on the [acromion and spine of the scapula](http://i.imgur.com/dgkoIvv.jpg) \n\n>* The traps are separated into 3 sections; [the upper, middle, and lower fibres](http://www.myweightlifting.com/image-files/trapezius.jpg) \n\n>*LATS*\n\n>* The lats have many origins. These include, but are not limited to: the [T7 \u2013 L5 vertebrae](http://o.quizlet.com/S2h-5UPyvfft1HxVEWcJjw_m.png), [iliac crest of the sacrum](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Pelvis_diagram.png), and the [inferior angle of the scapula](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Inferior_angle_of_the_left_scapula01.png)\n\n>* They insert on the [humerus/upper arm](http://imgur.com/mop9j4O) \n\n>* A very interesting fact about the lats is that they are the only muscle that are attached to both the upper limb (arm) and the lower body (hip)\n\n>*UPPER BACK*\n\n>The upper back consists of various muscles:\n\n>* The [rhomboid major and minor](http://www.rad.washington.edu/academics/academic-sections/msk/muscle-atlas/upper-body/rhomboid-major-and-minor/atlasImage) originate on the T2-T5 and C7-T1 vertebrae, and attach on the [medial border of the scapula](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Medial_border_of_left_scapula01.png) \n\n>* The [teres major](http://www.myweightlifting.com/image-files/teres-major.jpg) and [teres minor](http://www.myweightlifting.com/image-files/teres-minor.jpg) originate on the [lateral border of the scapula](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Lateral_border_of_left_scapula01.png), and attach on  the humerus\n\n>* The [infraspinatus and supraspinatus](http://www.shoulderdoc.co.uk/images/uploaded/rotator2.jpg) originate on the [infraspinous fossa](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Infraspinatous_fossa_of_left_scapula01.png/250px-Infraspinatous_fossa_of_left_scapula01.png) and [supraspinous fossa](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Supraspinous_fossa_of_left_scapula01.png) of the scapula, and attach on the humerus\n\n>**FUNCTION**\n\n>*TRAPS*\n\n>* Remember that the traps have upper, middle, and lower fibres. Each of these fibres play a specific role, giving the trapezius muscle many roles\n\n>* The upper fibres primarily [elevate the scapula](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vkVqNLHIiM0/T0PK_y-AZoI/AAAAAAAAAoM/1qcpSlZ7Fxk/s1600/Shoulder+elevation.png) \n\n>* The middle fibres primarily [retract the scapula](https://admin.imatrixbase.com/clients/1795/images/content_transfer/188_photo_scapular_retraction.jpg) \n\n>* The lower fibres [depress the scapula](http://o.quizlet.com/i/saxgyhEtJNAVNUkxFn2Bkg_m.jpg) \n\n>* Another function of the traps is that they prevent humeral dislocation (they prevent your arm from popping out of your shoulder)\n\n>*LATS*\n\n>* The lats have two primary functions\n\n>* [Arm adduction](http://img.tfd.com/mk/A/X2604-A-18.png)\n\n>* [Shoulder extension](https://breddydotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/shoulder-flexion-and-extension-supine-with-arrows.png) \n\n>*UPPER BACK*\n\n>* The main function of the muscles of the upper back is to retract the [shoulder blade](https://admin.imatrixbase.com/clients/1795/images/content_transfer/188_photo_scapular_retraction.jpg)\n\n>**TRAINING TIPS**\n\n>\u201cI\u2019ve seen guys with big arms and big pecs that weren\u2019t that strong. But I\u2019ve never seen a guy with a big back that wasn\u2019t strong.\u201d\n\n>This is one of my favorite quotes. A big, muscular back does not come without strength.  I personally believe that to fully develop a big back, it is important to deadlift, squat, and even perform some of the Olympic lifts (cleans, snatches).  Although the lifts stated above place a large emphasis on the lower body, the back plays a fundamental role while performing them.  You\u2019ll have a tough time finding a successful [powerlifter](http://www.getbig.com/boards/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=446436.0;attach=490747;image) or [weightlifter](http://www.allthingsgym.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Lu-Xiaojun-Chinese-Weightlifting-Snatch-Pulls-Back-Cover-Milo-194-.jpg) that doesn\u2019t have a large back. \n\n>But putting those lifts aside, back specific work is very important. A trick I use for almost all rowing movements is using a [thumbless grip](http://fitworldexposed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/7.png). A lot of people, myself included, have the tendency to pull more so with their arms rather than their back.  Using a thumbless grip lets me envision my arms as hooks for my back, allowing me to really focus on contracting my back muscles rather than using my biceps to pull. Keep in mind that using a thumbless grip also requires higher grip strength in order to hold on to the bar. \n\n>Some people are taught that exercises using a wider grip will make your back wider, while a closer grip will make your back thicker.  Although I am not aware of any scientific studies proving this, I believe it to be true. This is through anecdotal evidence I have witnessed in my own body, and many professional bodybuilders also vouch for this. \n\n>A back day for me consists of 4-5 lat movements, and 1-2 upper back movements (I train traps on my shoulder day).\n\n>**TRAPS TRAINING**\n\n>For the average person, their trap routine goes no further than holding [very heavy weight and barely shrugging it, moving their shoulder about a centimeter up and down](http://youtu.be/y5qKFty8Jcc?t=2m26s). Although this can be fairly effective, there are ways to train this muscle that are much safer, and are much more efficient. \n\n>* [Deadlifts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3FoLv-J854) \n\n>* [Dumbbell Shrugs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDt6qbKgLkY) \n\n>One of the most underrated exercises for developing the traps is deadlifts. One of the functions of the traps mentioned above is to keep the humerus attached to the shoulder.  When you perform a deadlift, the traps are working like crazy to ensure that the weight you are holding on your hands doesn\u2019t rip your arm out of its socket. Big deadlift numbers are often associated with big traps. Powerlifter [Pete Rubish](http://crossfitbattlefield.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Pete-Rubish-traps.jpg), who is well known for his monstrous deadlifts, is also well known for his cobra like traps \n\n>Going back to shrugs, it is important to recall the functions of all fibres of the traps. Remember that they not only elevate the shoulder, but they also retract the scapula. When doing shrugs, it is important to keep your shoulder blades retracted the entire time. Neglecting this will not only hinder your trap development, but it will also have a negative impact on your posture over time. [Here](http://youtu.be/cJRVVxmytaM?t=37s) is a good video explaining how to keep perform shrugs correctly. I have personally found Medows Shrugs to the best shrug variation to develop my traps.  [Paul Carter explains them here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQuDPFplpmk).  \n\n>A very common mistake when doing shrugs is [rolling your shoulders](http://youtu.be/h3rj2KAmyHc?t=57s) as you do them.  This is not safe for your shoulders can result in injury very quickly. \n\n>**LATS TRAINING**\n\n>The lats are one of the most important muscles in the body for healthy movement and athletic function. In almost any professional sport that involves a need for power or physical contact, you\u2019ll see big lats. This is visible even in smaller fighters, like [Manny Pacquiao](http://www.nowboxing.com/wp-content/uploads/Pacquiao-wings-262x300.jpg). \n\n>90% of my back training revolves around my lats. When training them, it is important to perform both overhead movements, as well as rows in the horizontal plane. \n\n>* [Bent-Over Barbell Rows](http://youtu.be/wGWdrxuP3JY)/[Dumbbell Rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZa2-rOySw) \n\n>* [Pull Ups](http://youtu.be/f11o61rfcsQ?t=12s)/[Lat Pull Down](http://youtu.be/f11o61rfcsQ?t=5m34s) \n\n>* [T-Bar Rows](http://youtu.be/HQm2K5OpEbM?t=19m25s) \n\n>* [Cable Pull Overs](https://instagram.com/p/toFyHkjvKs/?modal=true) \n\n>If you clicked on the videos linked for the exercises above, you\u2019ll notice that almost every single video is linked to Kai Greene.  This was done intentionally because I believe Kai has perfected back training.  \nWhen you train a muscle, you need to stretch it, and then contract it.  The [lats are stretched when your arm moves overhead](http://www.leehayward.com/art_pics/stretch/lat_stretch.jpg). It is important to apply this to your rows when you are targeting your lats. Kai demonstrates this perfectly in both his barbell and dumbbell rows.  At the bottom of each rep, he lets the weight hang forward. You can see this [here](http://imgur.com/17zsT3R,ky55uGL#0) on his barbell row, and [here](http://imgur.com/17zsT3R,ky55uGL#1) on his dumbbell row. This type of movement lets you stretch the lats as much as you can during these exercises, which allows for a much better contraction when you pull the weight. You will also notice that he pulls the weight to his stomach. Again, this lets you contract the lats fully. When you pull the weight to your chest, you will be using your upper back at a higher scale than your lats.  Here are the [barbell row ](http://youtu.be/wGWdrxuP3JY) and [dumbbell row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZa2-rOySw) videos again.\n\n>Pull Ups are arguably the best lats exercise there is. You can fully stretch the lats through their range of motion and fully contract them as well. I like to super set these with lat pull downs. I like to alter my grip width for both of these exercises regularly to target different parts of my lats/back (yes, I know its broscience, but I believe in it). \nMost people believe that pullovers are primarily a chest exercise, but when done correctly, they are an excellent lats exercise. They are also a great way to teach yourself how to really \u201cflare\u201d your lats.\n\n>**UPPER BACK TRAINING**\n\n>I don\u2019t spend a lot of time specifically on upper back training because I feel that it is hit sufficiently through all of my movements that are targeted for my lats. I usually perform one exercise specifically for my upper back. \n\n>* [Wide grip cable rows](https://instagram.com/p/xiOEh0TVx7/?modal=true) \n\n>* [Barbell rows to chest](http://youtu.be/6d2cBgpm0C0) \n\n>The function of the upper back is specifically to retract the scapula. When you perform a row, it is important to really squeeze your shoulder blades together to fully work the muscles you want to.  With people who are new to this concept, I like to put a finger in the middle of their back, and tell them to try and squeeze my finger with their shoulder blades with each rep. To fully maximize this, you can [protract your scapula, as seen in image A,](https://johanngfitness.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/band-pull-apart.jpg) at the beginning of a row, which will fully stretch the upper back muscles, and then only squeeze the scapula together when you pull towards yourself.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Splitting the back into upper back, lats, and traps\n\n* When training traps, retract your shoulder blades, and then shrug\n\n* Don't roll your shoulders as you shrug\n\n* Most of your back training should revolve around lats\n\n* Watch Kai Greene's form on dumbbell and barbell rows to learn how to fully engage the lats\n\n* Upper back training should emphasize squeezing your scapula as hard as you can ", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Back 101: An Anatomical Guide to Training", "post_ups": 3943, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2yozrg/back_101_an_anatomical_guide_to_training/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:10.322922", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "WiliamFancyPants", "post_created_utc": 1467730848.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1467816871.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "4rd2vb", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 655, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3927, "post_selftext": "[Progress Pics](http://imgur.com/ER8nisA)\n\n\n**BACKGROUND**\nHey guys, I'm William, and I wanted to share my fitness journey and lifestyle change with you. I've been trying to cut for a long time and am very proud of the results I've gotten so far. I'm going to continue the cut through to the end of the summer, and then I'll start gaining more strength (and finally enjoy more food again!).\n\nA little bit about myself: I used to be a video game addict. I remember going to bed at 2 am from playing video games and waking up 6 hours later to play again. The cycle repeated until I'd lost everything. My social life, my health, my sense of self and purpose. Now, I am a full time college student, I have a part-time job, and I'm still trying to find myself. Being on this journey has helped me do that.\n\n**DIET AND EXERCISE**\n\nAt first, I just tried to eat less and eyeball calorie intake, but that is much less effective and enjoyable than macro dieting. I've been macro dieting since March and love every second of it. Currently, my macros are:\n\nProtein: 234g\nCarbs: 234g\nFat: 52g\n\nThese macros work for me, and I've been able to lose weight consistently without losing muscle by following them.

Also, I'm still continuing my cut through to the end of the summer, so expect another post soon!\n\n**EDIT**\nWoke up to 3,000 upvotes! I love you guys. I've been reading some comments and notice some negativity towards my title. Here's my explanation for why I wrote it:\nFor some people, myself included, gaming is as toxic as alcoholism. You cannot compare yourselves to others. You can only write your story and hope that it inspires others that are in the same situation as yourself. I'm not denouncing gamers. I absolutely love video games and still do. I also believe that everyone is in charge of their own lives and generalizing a group takes away from individuality. I'm sharing my personal story and my solution to my problem. Hope this clears up the confusion. Thanks for the support!\n\n**EDIT**\nAlright everyone, I loved replying and answer a lot of people's questions. I'll continue tomorrow. Feel free to PM me any questions, as I will definitely work my way through every single one! \n\n**EDIT**\n\nGuys the game I play is league of legends (I still play don't worry)!

So let me get that out of the way first. I will try to provide a structured and hopefully easy to read, wright up for the last 6 months of my life. With that out of the way lets get to the backstory. \n\n**Backstory**\n\nI do not feel bad if you decide to skip this section. It's not really relevant in how the transformation happened but it is important for me and why it did. \n\nOver 9 months ago I was started losing the battle to severe depression. It got to the point where I was unintentionally starving myself and every day just hoping something terrible would happen to me. Passive suicidal thoughts where rampant and motivation to even get out of bed was an incredibly hard mountain to climb. While I rather not go into the reason why I ended up here, I will say that it was by far the hardest time in my life. As time went on the negativity crept into not only myself and my self image, but everything I said or did. It tended to breed itself into a viscous monster that ate and bad things continued to happen. Or at least that is how it seemed. Anything good that was there I instantly snuffed out and choose to look at the \"reality\" of the situation.\n\nThen that is when I realized I hit rock bottom. I decided there was two options for me. Stay in this depressive self loathing state and wait for my \"bad luck\" to kill me, or stand up and fight it. So here is where it all started. I just hit my golden birthday in august and I choose to fight. I signed up for the gym that day and got myself a personal trainer later that week. That choice to have someone help me wasn't easy but I knew that without motivation and someone keeping me honest I would fail and be right back to where I was three months prior. He not only helped me with my physical training but also helped me mentally stabilize and see the good that was all around me. So out of everything, this thread is a dedication to the man that unknowing saved my life. (*addressed to my personal trainer*) If by some weird chance you happen to read this, thank you, thank you so much. \n\n**WORKOUT CARDS**\n\nEvery 3-4 weeks I would perform a new set of workouts. Rotating workouts has been instrumental to me having the success I have been seeing. By having the workouts and lifts mixed up every so often the muscles continued to see growth and progress. This is an example of my current workout card and lifting weights. I have had so many workout cards for me that to list them all would take me days. Most of the workout cards are similarly based. Also this is custom tailored to me and my personal goals. I would strongly advise if you are going to base a workout on something similar to this, know your own body and do your research. The last day for this week will have the previous weight i accomplished with a + signifying that if possible I will attempt to lift more next week. \n\n**Lower body- Once a week**\n\nRest | Exercise 4 sets | Date 1 | Date 2 | Date 3\n---|---|----|----|----\n2-3 min | Barbell Squat | 245 x6 | 245 x8 | 245+ x10\n2-3 min | Leg Press  | 360 x 8 | 450 x 8 | 450+ x10\n90 sec | weighted step ups | 30 x10 | 45 x12 | 45+ x15\n60 sec | stability ball ham. curls | x10 | x12 | x15\n45 sec | V-squat calf raises | 135 x10 | 135 x12 | 135+ x15\n45 sec | Standing Calf Raises | 235 x 20 | 235 x25 | 235+ x30\n\n**Chest - Twice a week**\n\n\nRest | Exercise 4 sets | Date 1 | Date 2 | Date3\n---|---|----|----|----\n90s | Incline Bench | 155 x6 | 155 x8 | 155+ x10\n90s | Dips (chest focused) | x8 | x10 | x12+\n90s | Chest Fly w/ Hold | 70 x8 | 80 x10 | 80+ x12\n60s | Bosu Ball push up | **T**ill **F**ail | TF | TF\n\n**Upper Body- Once a week**\n\nRest | Exercise 4 sets| Date 1 | Date 2 | Date3\n---|---|----|----|----\n90s | Barbell deadlift | 225 x6 | 225 x8 | 225+ x10\n90s | Pull up variations | TF | TF | TF\n60s | Overhand row | 80 x8 | 100 x10 | 100+ x12\n60s | DB single arm row | 55 x8 | 55 x10 | 55+ x12\n45s | EZ bar curl | 75 x8 | 75 x10 | 75 x12\n45s | TRX bicept curl | TF | TF | TF\n\n**Shoulders- Once a week**\n\nRest | Exercise 4 sets| Date 1 | Date 2 | Date3\n---|---|----|----|----\n60s | Single Arm shoulder press | 60 x8e | 60 x10e | 60+ x12e\n60s | Barbell Upright Row | 100 x8 | 100 x10 | 100+ x12\n60s | Plate Front Raise w/ hold | 45 x8 | 45 x10 | 45+ x12+\n60s | Lateral Raises | 17.5 x20 | 17.5 x25 | 17.5+ x30\n60s | Seated Bent over Lat Raises | 17.5 x20 | 17.5 x25 | 17.5+ x30\n\n**CORE EVERYDAY-ALLDAY**\n\nThis is just a circuit of several different types of planks, holds, and weighted crunches. Nothing particularly special about it. just fight through the pain. \n\n**Cardio**\n\nOnce a week I will do some intense cardio. Honestly back in high school I was a skinny cross country runner. So obviously my preference is running. But I HATE running on a treadmill. So I tend to make sure I mix up my cardio with either biking or running. At least 30 mins of activities on these days, but usually I will push myself to go for an hour or so. Distance and speed does not matter just so long as its an active nonstop pace.\n\n\n**Nutrition**\n\nSo as if the workouts where not intense enough the nutrition is actually the hardest part. (at least for me) Every day I have pushed, or have tried to push, myself to eat 3500 calories. To help keep me honest and make sure that my diet is on point I log everything through MyFitnessPal. The balance between Carbs, fats, and protein is divided 40%,30,30 respectively. \n\nMy diet usually consists of whole grain pasta dishes and lots of different types of meats. This has been the hardest part for me being a broke/ poor college student. Learning to budget and cook proper meals has been an insane challenge. \n\nSupplements: Protein powder, Multi-vitamins, Fish oils and creatine.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nHeight: 5'10\". Now we get to my favorite part. Numerical results. Pictures can be deceiving and not only that, they don't tell the full story. But pure hard data in my opinion, is not only encouraging, but needed for proper growth. Measurements are in inches and in pounds. Measurements are taken about every two weeks or so while weight is recorded each week. Honestly I am surprised that the weight improvement is as consistent as it is. \n\nDate | Body Weight | Neck | Arm | Chest | Waist | Hip | thigh | Calf\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----\n9/3 | 136.6 | 14 | 10.25 | 35.75 | 28.5 | 36 | 20.5 | 13\n9/17 | 140.6 | \n9/24 | 140.4 |  \n10/1 | 144.8 | 14.25 | 10.75 | 36.25 | 30.5 | 36.5 | 21 | 13.25\n10/8 | 144.8 | \n10/15 | 147.8 | 14 | 11.25 | 37.25 | 30 | 36.5 | 21.5 | 13.25\n10/29 | 147.0 | \n11/5 | 149.0 | 14.5 | 11.25| 36.5 | 31 | 37.5 | 22 | 13.5\n11/12 | 151.0 | \n11/19 | 151.0 | \n11/25 | 151.2 | 14.75 | 11.25 | 37.75 | 31.5 | 37.75 | 22.75 | 13.75\n12/3 | 157.2 |  \n12/10 | 158.0 | 14.5 | 11.5 | 37.75 | 31.5 | 38 | 23 | 13.75\n12/17 | 156.8 |  \n12/23 | 156.8 | 14.5 | 11.5 | 38.5 | 31.25 | 38.5 | 22.75 | 13.75\n12/31 | 158.2 |  \n1/9 | 159.8 | 14.5 | 11.75 | 38.5 | 31.25 | 38 | 22.75 | 13.75\n1/16 | 161.2 | \n1/23 | 161.2 | 14.75 | 11.75 | 38.75 | 31.25 | 37.75 | 22.75 | 13.75\n1/30 | 165.4 | \n2/6 | 163.4 | 14.75 | 12.25 | 39 | 30.75 | 37.75 | 23.25 | 13.75\n2/13 | 165.2 |  \n2/20 | 165.6 | 15 | 12.25 | 38.75 | 31.5 | 38.25 | 23 | 14\n2/27 | 166.2 | \n3/5 | 167.4 | 15 | 12.25 | 39 | 31.5 | 38.75 | 23.75 | 14\n\n\n**Body Fat %**\nBody fat test are done usually once a month and done by the 7 point pinch test.

Not only have a physically improved myself but also mentally and spiritually. During my transformation you may notice this tattoo.[Here](http://i.imgur.com/NBDjDZJ.jpg?1). It represents everything I believe in. C for Courtesy, I for Integrity, P for perseverance, SC for ~~Starcraft~~ Self Control, and IS for indomitable Spirit. Loosely based off of the Halo legendary icon with the iron skull (\"death carries a heavy price\"). It represents everyday is a new day to rebuild yourself into the man I want to be. This transformation has given me the confidence to do things I have never done in my life. It is contagious too, I have noticed that my friends around me even have started to go to the gym. I just recently have gotten a promotion at my job. So my luck wasn't bad, it just was a self fulfilling prophesy that I unknowing controlled. \n\nThank you for reading, and to those of you out that are battling depression. Keep fighting, to this day I still have my bad days. But if you want change, it is only going to come from one person. You! You can do it!

With the help from MyFitness pal, I was able to input all my meals and stay on the right path. During the year my calories ranged from 1700 cals (final Cut) to 3600 cals (peak Bulk).\nMarco % for Bulk: 50C 30P 20F\nMarco % during Cut: 30C 35P 35F\nMy bulk phase involved eating entire pizzas and binging on McDonalds to reach my calorie surplus . I added protein bars and whey protein shakes to keep my intake at 1 gram/Lb Body weight.\nOn my Cut , I gave up all junk food and stuck to daily meal prepping. This also included cutting out bread, pasta & white rice. Chicken breasts, veggies and protein shakes were the main foods I consumed on my caloric defict. I drank 2L+ of water and 1-3 cups of black coffee daily. I found this to suppress my appetite and allow me to focus on my diet. 1-3 Quest bars daily was my secret weapon for snacking while completing my fiber intake.\n\nSUPPLEMENTS: \n\nWhey protein, quest protien bars and muscle milk was used daily to reach my protein goals. I have not tried creatine yet but will definitely try this fall. Pre workout was used before most gym sessions but lately I've been getting serious rashes from the powder PreWorkouts. Ive tried multiple ones, mr hyde, c4, mammoth pump etc. but have come with the side effects. So I've switched to black coffee while I've been cutting and sometimes used a zero Cal energy drink for the caffeine boost. \n\nFUTURE goals\n\nThe First year of training has left me hungry for greater results. I plan to improve my pathetic squats to 300+, hit 315 on bench and deadlift 450. \nIf anyone has questions regarding my diet/training I am happy to answer in the comments! :) -almost6feet\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "M/20/5'11 (15 month progress) PPL and iifym regilously!", "post_ups": 3883, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8tw02l/m20511_15_month_progress_ppl_and_iifym_regilously/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:10.322922", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "", "post_created_utc": 1433348452.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1433425531.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "38dyy5", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 558, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3872, "post_selftext": "I wanted to post a 12 month progress, but had my gall bladder removed in April, so I was kind of set back a month.  So here is my very short and quick 13 month progress.\n\n[Pics](http://imgur.com/a/fQ2Al)\n\n33 Male.  6'0\".  280 lbs ->  168 lbs\n\nAt my highest point, I was 280 lbs.  I lost a few pounds just by not eating as much junk, but not really tracking anything.  Then in April of last year I got more serious with dieting and working out.  \n\nDiet was pretty much a straight IIFYM diet.  Tracked with MyFitnessPal.  Started at about 1,000 calroie deficit initially, then decreased the deficit to about 500-750 towards the end.  Watched calories and I tried to get protein to about 160-180 grams, then after that, didn't worry too much about Carbs and Fats.  \n\nWorkout was pretty much all weight lifting with no cardio outside of regular daily type stuff (playing with kids, occasional bike ride or walk with dog, house/yard work, weekly softball game).  I started out with a PHUL routine, but ended up switching to a [P/P/L routine](http://imgur.com/a/rRCnz).  Would go about 3-5 days a week, depending on schedule.  Married with 2 kids, so couldn't always just set specific days and times for the gym.  It was just go when I could kind of thing.  I never once tried for max lifts.  Would just add/reduce weight depending on how my last workout was.  Actually had several times of negative progress, most likely because of being on a pretty decent deficit.  Now that I'm down, and will be going into a maintenance, and eventually a bulk, I will be doing more with actually tracking the progress of my lifts.  \n\nDo have a fair amount of loose skin in my chest, stomach and legs.  The legs are actually the worst area.  Have a lot of loose skin hanging around my thighs/butt area.  You can see some in the chest, I don\u2019t like it, but it\u2019s not as bad as it could have been.  My stomach you can\u2019t see the worst of it as my shorts hide it pretty well.  But it\u2019s definitely there, especially on the lower abs.    That ab shot in the bathroom is in part due to some \u2018generous\u2019 lighting.  \n\nEDIT:  \nToo hard to go through and reply to every comment, so thank you so much for the compliments and encouragement!  I was honestly still very self-conscious about my body and this has made me feel really good!\n\n\n**EDIT 2:**  Some replies to some questions I've gotten asked several times:\n\n-The app for the workout routine is JeFit (should be getting some royalties or something for the amount of times I've recommended them now.)\n\n-The Skin:  For right now, I'm not really doing anything about the loose skin.  It's still too early.  I will have to give my skin some time to see how much it might rebound naturally.  In the mean time, I'm going to work on adding some lean muscle to fill in the space.  I don't know if it's bad enough to justify the cost of surgery down the road.  It wouldn't be covered by my insurance, and I don't have that kind of cash lying around.  \n\n-My routine.  Yeah, it's a lot of volume.  And I don't do a set progression or anything.  Basically, I have a range of target reps, usually 5-7 for \"Big\" excercises, and then 8-12 for accessory types.  I will basically go to failure, or just short of failure, on every set of every exercise.  If it's too easy, I go up in weight.  If I don't make my target range, I go back down.   Sometimes it ends up looking like a reverse pyramid type of program.\n\n\nI received a lot of other questions.  I could post a follow-up thread in a week or so with more answers to people with questions if anyone would be interested in that.  Also maybe post a few more pics.  Espeically of the loose skin since a lot of people want to know about that. Reply or message me if that would actually interest anyone.\n\nI didn't think that people would be so interested or even impressed with this.  But I definitely would love to help anyone possible.

It's bodyweight only, so you need no equipment. It will still benefit your lifting when you have problems with squatting.\n\nTo be able to do it, you should be able to sit comfortably in a deep squat **(or put a block under your heels)** and have 5 minutes of time. Feel free to do it in the morning, or after your workouts.\n\nIf you don't want to watch the video, i'll put a description below:\n\n* You can put a block or a book under your heels if you can't squat all the way down yet.\n\n* Start by deep squatting for a minute.\n\n* Now do 30 seconds of bumping squat movements. Afterwards, do another 30 seconds, but rotate your upper body in the process.\n\n* Place your arms behind your back and rotate your hips open and closed, until your knees bump softly against each other. Repeat for 30 seconds.\n\n* Now you place your hands in front of you and lean forward until your elbows touch the floor. Bring your butt up into the air in the process. Afterwards, move back into the deep squat. Repeat for 10-20 times.\n\n* Next exercise are pistol and cossack extensions. Place your weight on one foot, extend the other leg into front or sides - while you use your extended arms as counter-balance. Repeat for 10 repetitions for each leg.\n\n* Last exercise is the forward lean. Lean forward and place your hands behind your legs on the floor. Stay in this stretch for 30 seconds.\n\nYou're done! Thanks for trying out my routine! I hope you like it, and i hope you will improve your squat with it!\n\nI would like to ask you guys some questions aswell, to start a discussion. So here we go:\n\n* What do you usually do to improve your squat flexibility?\n* Do you think hip mobility is important for lifting?\n\nEdit: Since some of the comments mention missing the video link above, [here it is again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_sHL0WXZDs)!", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "I created a Squat Mobility Routine that you can do daily to supplement your leg and hip flexibility.

Gave up booze and started my journey to a healthy lifestyle. By focusing on CICO, eating healthy, and going to the gym 3-5 times a week I was able to drop 77 lbs. At my heaviest back in January of last year I was 232 lbs, 5\u20199\u201dand 36 yrs old, I mildly watched my diet the first 4 months and dropped maybe 15 lbs. In may I really started to think about health and that\u2019s when I started CICO, at first I was running off about 1200 calories but that was just too little so I brought it up to 1500 and every 4 weeks I would have a week around 18-1900. I also started at a gym back in may, at first it was my local city rec center just to get comfortable and figure out what this working out thing was. Shortly after I joined another gym in town and started a basic ppl program. Since then I left that gym and joined a new one just due to my work schedule and it allows me to use multiple locations in multiple cities so when I\u2019m away I don\u2019t have a excuse to skip. Currently I am doing a 5/3/1 but really want to dial in my program as I am still kind of all over the place. Most of my lifts aren\u2019t to good yet so I\u2019ll skip them until I get better results but all I can say is I did get to 3 plates on a deadlift this week for 2 ugly reps! \n\nUp next I\u2019m going to now start upping my calories up to about 25-2600 and Work on muscle growth. Goal is to increase another 10lbs of muscle by January 2019 by bulking and cutting and stay around the 10-12% BF. Upping the clean eating is probably going to be the hard part as even now on my 1900 weeks it feels that I was having to really focus at getting higher healthy calories in. Think I will just add slightly bigger portions and 1-2 extra meals per day. I generally always meal prep and make a dz meals of 4-5oz of lean protein and rice and a form of veg that make up a 400-450 calorie meal and will go from 2 to 4 of those per day. \n\n\n Thanks r/fitness for all the tips and tricks you have gave me! \n\n[progress photo](https://imgur.com/gallery/GzJ46)", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "1/3 my body weight gone, down 77 lbs!", "post_ups": 3858, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7cfzgf/13_my_body_weight_gone_down_77_lbs/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:10.322922", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "mattBLiTZ", "post_created_utc": 1499289327.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1499301238.0, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "6lh1j7", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 419, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3848, "post_selftext": "Stats: \nBefore: 5\u20198 130 lbs, M 20 y/o - 55 lbs bench, 65 lbs squat\nAfter: 5\u20198 200 lbs, M 26 y/o - mid 300\u2019s bench, mid 400\u2019s squat \n \nFull before/after album: http://imgur.com/a/706Fr\nBonus filtered pic of legs because they\u2019ve come the furthest haha: http://i.imgur.com/MgsCvjX.jpg\n**Full lifting/nutrition details at the bottom!**\n \n--\n \nHey guys! I\u2019ve been lurking r/fitness off and on since before the first day ever stepping foot inside a gym, and I thought maybe my story could be interesting to a few of you. I notice we get a lot of posts about people who were playing video games all day and ended up quitting that to pursue a healthy gym life. Totally cool - but my story is a little different. I actually got MORE dedicated to my love of video games during my fitness/life transformation, so I want to give hope to people who think it\u2019s an either/or decision! \n \nAt the time of writing this I\u2019m the 3rd ranked achievement hunter in the world on PC (Steam - over 117,000 achievements earned, over 840 games 100% complete) and have had a wide variety of success including a few dozen Guinness World Record book appearances, Xbox/Playstation world championship victories, getting my own official video game trading card, and various other nerd stuff like getting some articles written about me for a 43-hours-straight marathon session (which resulted in a world first for Borderlands 2). Since this is an r/fitness post I don\u2019t want to dwell on the non-fitness parts of it, but totally willing to talk more about it in the comments if you guys are interested. I think it is an important part of my story to make clear though: **I got WAY better and more accomplished at video games after starting my fitness journey!** In fact I gave a talk at one of the big gaming conventions (PAX) about how I feel gamers are super-charged potential ready to be unleashed on fitness success. One of my main goals is to show other people like me that they have this power inside.\n \nAnyways, I grew up very small and skinnyfat, reaching a peak of 130 lbs as an adult after being in the low 100-something lbs range through high school. Somehow not that lean of a 100-130 because I grew up never playing a single sport or...going outside, and instead spent my developmental years glued to Runescape, World of Warcraft, Halo, etc. \n\nBefore lifting:  http://i.imgur.com/zn6SW3z.png\n \nSo many people told me I had to quit playing video games all the time and start going to the gym, and I gave a big \u201chell no\u201d to that. It wasn\u2019t until my third year of college that my formerly-overweight best friend tried lifting weights and convinced me to give it a shot. He basically said \u201cdude check out r/fitness and try Starting Strength\u201d and I was on my way. This was mid-2011.\n \nFirst day in the gym was a confusing nightmare. I was googling \u201cwhat does a barbell look like\u201d and similar questions from my phone, desperately trying to figure out what was going on. I still have a picture of a squat rack from the very first time in the gym, which I sent to someone to ask what it was. My starting lifts were basically 45 lbs or slightly more. I will forever remember failing 45x1 on overhead press and having to try some lighter dumbbells to get the motion down. Needless to say, I was very weak and had a long road ahead. I ended up alternating between a day with squat/overhead press/deadlift and a day with squat/bench press/assisted pullups, sometimes throwing in a few curls or something. Basic minimalist linear progression with barbells (3x/week). I had help and motivation from a few cool internet people like u/MythicalStrength and was on my way!\n \nThis is my first \u201cafter\u201d picture, the strongest and most fit I\u2019ve ever been in my life (yikes): http://i.imgur.com/2ELD36a.jpg\n \nEventually I started getting pretty burned out and realizing that I needed to do something more fun, I started doing 5/3/1 which introduced the startling concept of...doing more than 5 reps of an exercise. Needless to say the adjustment was brutal, haha, and it was definitely the right move. AMRAP sets were a huge motivator for me, and I made an excel spreadsheet with a full list of all my best reps at each weight, best sets of 5x10, etc. After that, I rotated through a few powerlifting-specific programs and worked my numbers up to a 200-something bench, 300-something squat, and just over 400 deadlift...then totally lost motivation at the beginning of 2013. Didn\u2019t really make any progress that year. Here\u2019s me in 2014 getting ready to set goals again:\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/8PkgqHE.png\n \nAs you can see I\u2019ve put on a TON of mass from where I started...but a lot of it still not good, haha. I stuck to barbells as a foundation again with almost the exact same program I started with in 2011, then switched to the PHAT template and learned a ton of new exercises. For the first time, building toward looks as a primary goal seemed like a cool thing to do, rather than obsessing over the barbell numbers as my only metric for success. My motivation was very off and on, and the big long term goal and my discipline toward it was the only thing that kept me on track most of the time. Eventually I switched over to some basic push/pull/legs action and modified that completely by feel. Sometimes I\u2019d do sets of 30-50, sometimes I\u2019d do a bunch of sets of 4, and so on. But usually I\u2019ll gravitate, these days, to sets of 8-12 for my main work, maybe 15\u2019s or 20\u2019s for certain stuff.\n \nHere\u2019s me now after all that, sitting right at 200 lbs.\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/7qcw3Z7.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/zIJ7ci1.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vdWGHyo.jpg\n \nExample template for the workouts. Exercises would be worked on with increasing weight or reps each time until I don\u2019t feel like the following session would be productive to attempt this (loss of rep quality, or just running myself too hard into a wall) and then rotated out for another variation. Another strategy I may use is to REDUCE the weight of an exercise every single week, but increase the sets and reps. Nothing groundbreaking, but I spent so long desperately trying to increase the weight every single time that it took me a while to realize all these other options, haha\n \nHere\u2019s a recent example of how my 3 days on / 1 day off rotation looks:\n \nPush:\n\nBarbell incline up to a heavy set of 10, then lighter 4x10\n\nDumbbell ohp 5x10\n\nRope pushdowns 3x12\n\nOverhead rope extensions 3x12\n\nSide raises 3x15\n\nDips 3xFailure\n\nPull:\n\nDeadlift 3x5\n\nTbar rows 3x10\n\nSeated rows 3x15\n\nRear flyes 3x12\n\nFace pulls 3x15\n\nLat pulldowns 3x15\n\nPreacher curls 3x20\n\nLegs:\n\nSquat 4x6\n\nLeg press 3x20\n\nLeg extension 4x12\n\nLeg curls 4x15\n\nCalf raises 3x18\n\nDumbbell curls 3x12 (<-Yes I know this isn't legs, but it's a major weakpoint, haha)\n \n \nBiggest struggles / mistakes / lessons:\n \n1. CONSISTENCY - Lots of on/off cycles of going super hard, then not at all. In 2017, I feel like I finally for the first time in my life locked into a firm unwavering dedication to a fitness-based future and am feeling accepting about the ups and downs in the process. Understanding that not every week or month will have 100% dedication is a huge part of fitness for me, because beating myself up too much about it will surely lead to crashing and burning.\n2. BALANCE - Not like, balancing on a tightrope, but I mean balancing the effort you put into your workouts. I\u2019ve had bad habits of dumping 90% of my energy in the first exercise or two and then neglecting the rest, and then years later tried to correct it by putting way too little effort into my exercises in fear of not finishing the workout strong with good reps. Of course, I then figured out that the answer is somewhere in between. Hit your \u201cmain\u201d movements hard, but with a smart plan, and then attack your assistance movements with sufficient ferocity as well! They matter a lot more than I realized.\n3. NUTRITION - I\u2019ve struggled a lot with eating properly throughout my life and I neglected it for a very long time. For most of my time lifting, I was basically cramming myself with whatever easy fast food I could find, just desperately fixated on putting in more calories and gaining more muscle and adding more strength. I even did \"gallon of milk per day\" for a month early on, haha. I started to find pretty good success with the IIFYM style, eating a lot of \u201cunhealthy foods\u201d but at least \u201cintelligently chosen junk\u201d, for lack of a better phrase haha. But my results were very slow, and very strength-based (eat whatever I need to get my squat to go up, even if I gain some fat) so as my goals shift, my nutrition has shifted to roughly the following for now, and obviously adjustments are made up/down depending on goal and results:\n \n7am: Eggs, sliced turkey, toast, packet of flavored oatmeal\n\n10am: Cereal, whey shake (usually I DON\u2019T use protein powder, but started to now preworkout like this)\n\n11am: Start sipping on a 50g carb shake (lots of brand options, go with taste preference haha)\n\n1pm: Some kind of meat (maybe chicken or tilapia), rice, some cashews, some veggies\n\n6pm: Some kind of meat (maybe salmon or steak), potatoes, and a small salad\n\n8pm: Greek yogurt and nuts\n \nQuantities are adjusted up and down but right now that\u2019ll put me around 220g pro / 320g carb / 85g fat. This is the most protein and least fat I\u2019ve ever had in my life, for what it\u2019s worth! I\u2019m liking it.\n \nCurrent goals: Making fat loss a focus while trying to slowly improve strength, then add some mass to these arms and back! Kind of vague, I know - but my main goals end up being simple stuff like \u201cI want to do all these reps again, but 5 lbs more on the bar next time.\u201d Keeps me focused!\n \nPhew, well I think that covers the main details so far! Please don\u2019t hesitate to ask if you\u2019re curious about any more details or info - this is the first time writing a transformation post haha! And I\u2019d like to say thanks to you all, to r/fitness but just to everyone who has that calling to ask questions and share answers with each other with the purpose of us all collectively growing. Without internet communities like this one, I know 100% that I never would have gotten myself into the life I live now. Fitness in 2017 is such a beautiful and accessible thing because of communities like this one. It really has changed my life to something completely unrecognizable, in all the best ways.\n\nedit: Oh god I'm \"that guy\" making the typical edit - I love you all so much and I'm so overwhelmed and thankful for these comments.

Below I share my beginning and current stats along with information about the dieting protocol I utilized along with exercise protocol I experienced with. Please feel free to comment and I will do my best to answer more questions if the interest is there.\n\n**Fitness has changed my life.**\n\nGrowing up, I was bullied mercilessly. I still remember times when I was strangled in public and no one stood up for me. I was laughed at and beat up so many times, was the youngest in my class for the majority of my childhood years and also one of the skinniest. I was suicidal and severely depressed up until my early teen years. \n\nI began working out in my room when I was around 12 with just a push-up set and no idea how to train, but as I pursued fitness, I realized that it was a venue for me to rise above and become someone who I wanted to be: outgoing, confident, energetic, positive and happy. It has brought me all those and more.\n\nMy physique began to transform, and when I turned 17 and entered college, I began pursuing it as a lifestyle. It had developed into a passion. I also got NASM-certified at 18 and began training clients of all ages, developing great relationships and having the opportunity to change lives through training like I never would have imagined.\n\nHowever, up until last year, I was still in a mental shell. I suffered from severe social anxiety and would get panic attacks when I was in certain situations and deciding whether or not to attend a social event. I grew up in a very traditional Asian family and was cultured to be afraid of the world. \n\nThis past year, I pushed myself to attend huge **raves solo and sober and forced myself to meet new people as I always wanted to experience the scene (I love EDM). I documented some of it in the video and hope it can inspire some of you all out there. These were some of the most exhilarating experiences of my life.**\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n**Starting a youtube channel and inspiring and reaching more people through fitness has been a dream of mine the past few years and is the next step for me.** I have been approached by many people regarding fitness, so I feel a big calling to start a channel to share my journey and want to encompass fitness, confidence and progressing in life. My goal through fitness is not just to improve myself, but also to impact, change and inspire others to pursue fitness and a happier life.\n\nIn the future I would like to open my own gym and may try my hand at competing in the NPC or in powerlifting competitions. I am also developing my training business as I have had success training clients in person and am branching out in the Los Angeles area. I may pursue further schooling in the future for physical therapy or medicine. \n\nDue to school these past few years, I did not feel I could commit fully to developing a quality channel. I busted my butt in college and achieved high honors, but now I am pursuing this endeavor to hopefully inspire more people throughout the world through my passion for fitness. \n\nHere are the stats to my transformation and my info:\n\n**Beginning weight, height and age**: 140 lbs, 5\u20199, 16 years old\n\n**My current weight, height and age:** 185 lbs, 6\u2019 and 21 years old\n\n**Current credentials:**\n\n-Certified as a Personal Trainer, corrective exercise specialist and fitness nutrition specialist by the National Academy of Sports Medicine: CPT, CES, FNS \n\n-Bachelor of Science: Phi Beta Kappa in Human Biology Exercise Physiology\n\n-Fitness Model with Naturally Fit Agency\n\n-Owner at DavidWangFitness\n\n**Detailed Diet and exercise routine history:**\n\n-Consistently tracking macros for 1023 days straight at this point and modifying as necessary\n\n-In the beginning, I was extremely strict with my diet, eating every 2 hours, packing a massive cooler with me to work daily and was even ridiculed for doing this. But it helped me stay on track towards my fitness goals. I have learned a lot through education since this point and how to modify my diet further to adjust to situations, but meal prepping and sticking to whole foods the majority of the time has been a big part of my diet plan.\n\n-**Calories consumed**: From 16 - 17, I consumed around 3000 calories a day as this allowed me to make significant noob gains. However, I modified my caloric intake as I saw fit based on my progress. If my weight was stalling or I was not seeing strength gains, I slightly increased my calories to allow for a slightly greater surplus. However, I aimed to always stay fairly lean. I gauged this by my overall definition (mostly abs) and weight. If I wanted to get leaner, I tracked macros and adjusted accordingly to allow for a caloric deficit and gauged progress by weight and how I looked. \n\n-**Supplements consumed**: Whey protein, creatine, beta alanine, fish oil, BCAAs, multivitamin. All natural stuff. I have never used a pre-workout in my life as I feel these are unnecessary and often have a ton of stimulants like caffeine and ingredients and can cause dependency. I zone in for my training sessions 10 - 15 minutes before I train and meditate, visualizing success and preparing for intensity. The mind and focusing 100% on your training goals to me is far more powerful than a pre-workout supplement.\n\n-**Programs followed**: When I first began training (before 16), I had no knowledge whatsoever about program design\u2026would knock out tons of push-ups in my room. Led to shoulder impingement and elbow tendonitis from improper training (not enough pulling to balance the pushing). This made me start learning how to train smart and helped me develop a passion for the body.\n\nI currently structure my own training split as I have found what works best for my body, which is DUP (daily undulating periodization) style training. However, around 16 years old, I trained for athletics and plyometrics, following volume and explosive based training for basketball. \n\nThen, I began similar protocol to starting strength to build strength, but stuck with lower reps for big compounds and hypertrophy rep ranges for accessories. Over time, I developed more knowledge and began modifying rep ranges for strength and hypertrophy protocol based on my progress and goals. Today I primarily stick with DUP.\n\n\n\n-**Beginning stats for bench, squat and deadlift**: \n\nBench: 95 lbs for 1 rep\n\nSquat: 95 lbs for 3x5 superset with step-ups 3x5\n\nDeadlift: ~135 lbs\n\n**Current stats for bench, squat and deadlift:**\n\nBench: ~260\u2026I typically stick with incline bench for 225 for reps\u20263x3 or so due to bench causing issues for me the in past due to previous shoulder impingement. But I have been recently incorporating it back into my routine.\n\nSquat: 420\u20262x3\n\nDeadlift: 525\u20262x3\n\n**Thank You:**\n\n**Thank you all for taking the time to read this post and I hope it inspires you guys to take control of your life and settle for nothing less.**", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Overcoming social anxiety, depression and my 5 year transformation through fitness (16 \u2014> 21)", "post_ups": 3840, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4m84w9/overcoming_social_anxiety_depression_and_my_5/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:10.322922", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Reptarhikes", "post_created_utc": 1447051787.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1447099355.0, "post_gilded": 2, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 2, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "3s3tjw", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 672, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3834, "post_selftext": "[Before and After](http://i.imgur.com/9ipvLUm.jpg)\n\nI started started the trail at 155lbs. and ended at 135lbs.\n\nFor anyone interested I had a Facebook page documenting the hike.

I currently hold the IPF world record for deadlift in the 57kg (125lb) jr. class. In light of all the progress posts lately, I was inspired (and bored enough) to create my own to show people the aesthetic side of my powerlifting progress. The time span is 5.5 years, with 4 years of that actually lifting. I took a full year off freshman year of college and a semester of my junior year.\n\n\n**Photos**\n\n[Before](http://imgur.com/a/5VMsb)\n\n[After](http://imgur.com/a/DLJyT)\n\n\n**About me**\n\nI'm 21 and recently graduated from college. Most of my lifting was done while I was schooling and also working my own business training horses.\n\n\n**Training**\n\nThe first year I started out was on a program given to us for a weight training class I took in school. I made decent progress in my shoulders and abs during that time, but it was minimal everywhere else. After that, I switched to Starting Strength for another 1.5 years or so. I saw good strength gains on this program, but had very little aesthetic changes. Eventually I hit a plateau and switched to a PPL program I designed. I stuck to that for 1 year and saw my first leg gains! The past year I have been on an upper/lower split. I have found this program lets me recover best for optimal strength, while still letting me see visual gains.\n\n\nDAY 1: Deadlift + light squats + glute/hamstring accessories\n\nDAY 2: Bench + tricep/chest/upper back accessories\n\nDAY 3: Rest\n\nDAY 4: Squat + quad accessories\n\nDAY 5: Bench + tricep/chest/upper back accessories\n\nDAY 6 + 7: Rest\n\n\n**Nutrition**\n\nCurrently I am on a light cut/maintenance so I stay within my weight class for my upcoming competition in August. I am eating 1800 calories or less most days with 1 or 2 cheat meals a week. I aim for at least ~100g of protein a day, eat high fat, and limit carb consumption to  less that 30% of my daily calorie intake on most days. I limit sugar to primarily pre and post workout. While maintaining I eat 2000-2200 calories, and while bulking I eat 2300-2500 a day. I stink at bulking so I am usually trying to bulk for the greater part of the year.\n\n\n**ETC**\n\nSo my progress was done over 4 years actually lifting. In terms of aesthetics alone, I believe most women could have achieved a similar physique in a slightly shorter time frame. My bulking was/is limited by my weight class of 125 lbs/57kg. I plan on staying in this weight class for a few more years until I age out of juniors. After that I plan on going up a weight class. My physical gains are very slow at this point due to an already low bodyfat% combined with lack of caloric surplus to draw from.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Female / 115->125 lbs / 5'5 : My progress from skinny skeleton to internationally competitive powerlifter", "post_ups": 3836, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4qn8ne/female_115125_lbs_55_my_progress_from_skinny/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:10.322922", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "famousoutfits", "post_created_utc": 1419292975.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2q4dnv", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 1594, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3825, "post_selftext": "The NYT shows us what roughly 2,000 calories looks like at some large chains.

As time goes by, I often wonder what happened to those people about whom I read and whether or not they stuck with fitness. It's possible to imagine that these transformation stories are instances of short-lived motivation that simply peters out. The purpose of this post is to show you that the transformation process can be sustainable if done correctly. Since my last post, I've continued to bodybuild and began competing in powerlifting. [This was my original transformation post from four years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/21yvse/my_3_year_transformation_from_clinically_obese/)\n\n---\n\n\n## **Stats/Progress**\n\n---\n\n**Sex:** Male\n\n**Age:** 30\n\n**Height:** 5'10\"\n\n**2010:** [240lbs](https://i.imgur.com/8tCqN.jpg)\n\n**2013:** [160lbs](http://i.imgur.com/CQtMdX7.png)\n\n**2014:** [165lbs](https://imgur.com/5qPbxJR)\n\n**2016** [170lbs](https://i.imgur.com/YuxGKQK.jpg)\n\n**2017** [180lbs](https://i.imgur.com/kYRzwQa.png)\n\n**2018 (now):** [175lbs](https://i.imgur.com/YxQJyL0.jpg)\n\n[current legs](https://i.imgur.com/x2Ybouj.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## **Recap of the journey**\n---\n\n* In 2010, I was [extremely obese and sick of it.](https://i.imgur.com/8tCqN.jpg)\n* I started dieting and doing cardio and got [very skinny](http://i.imgur.com/CQtMdX7.png).\n* At some point during my weightloss, I started lifting and [put on some muscle](http://i.imgur.com/wDZdndH.jpg).\n* After the weightloss, [I had a bunch of extra skin](http://i.imgur.com/mIFxjAB.png).\n* I had the surgery to [remove the excess skin](http://i.imgur.com/XLGMNYs.jpg).\n* I began to really enjoy the process of transforming my body and did [my first bodybuilding show in 2014](https://imgur.com/5qPbxJR).\n\n---\n\n## **How I did it: Training and Diet**\n\n---\n\n\n###Training\n\n* After doing my last bodybuilding show, I was a little burnt out on the extreme dieting so I gave powerlifting a shot.\n* I competed in the 83KG division at a local meet.\n* I totaled 1,132 lbs. Not a great total, but it was a fun experience.\n   * [Deadlifting 462lbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5IZ4fC-EXE)\n   * [Squatting 375lbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzriS6BsaiI)\n   * [Benching 295 lbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffFY51MgMMc)\n* To prepare for the meet, I utilized a training protocol known as [5/3/1 Big But Boring.](https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101077382-boring-but-big)\n* I trained four days a week with the following training days:\n   * Day One\n      * Press \u2013 5/3/1\n      * Press \u2013 5 sets of 10 reps\n      * Lat work \u2013 5 sets of 10 reps\n   * Day Two\n      * Deadlift \u2013 5/3/1\n      * Deadlift \u2013 5 sets of 10 reps\n      * Abs \u2013 5 sets\n   * Day Three\n      * Bench Press \u2013 5/3/1\n      * Bench Press \u2013 5 sets of 10 reps\n      * Lat work \u2013 5 sets of 10 reps\n   * Day Four\n      * Squat \u2013 5/3/1\n      * Squat \u2013 5 sets of 10 reps\n      * Abs \u2013 5 sets\n\n* [Here is a template to utilize the 5/3/1 protocol.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eVpZVso86a4C5ZqcdQzYWGD_DpZF6wgwbeZzp9GZ21s/edit#gid=1298676863)\n\n\n###Macros\n\n* My goal for all of this is sustainability. Sure it's possible to get shredded through a juice fast, but what good is that if you just bounce back one week after you're finished dieting. This is where counting macros comes in.\n* Counting macros is a sustainable way to create a flexible diet that you can stay on no matter what circumstances life throws at you.\n* When I say counting macros, I mean to eat in a strategic way of fullfilling specific macronutrient goals. The types of food are not important, only the macronutrient profile of those foods matter.\n* To track the macronutrient profile of the foods I ingest, I use [My Fitness Pal for iphone](https://www.myfitnesspal.com) along with a food scale when it's available. When a food scale is not available, I will approximate my intake based on prior experience with the scale.\n* To learn how to count macros, I suggest watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me_s_U-xzQY)\n* To calculate my macros, I will do the following process:\n   * To start a cut or bulk, I use [IIFYM's macro calculator](https://www.iifym.com/iifym-calculator/). This will give me a caloric goal to achieve my specified weight-loss or weight-gain objective.\n   * Once I have my caloric intake goal clarified, I create a macronutrient profile for that caloric intake.\n   * I determine my macro-nutrient profile by first accounting for my protein of which I try to intake at least 1 gram per lb of bodyweight. For me currently that's 175g protein.\n   * Then, I calculate my fat intake of which I prefer a higher amount, sometimes as high as 40&#37; of my caloric intake. Currently that's 100 grams of fat.\n   * However many calories remain will go to carbohydrates.\n   * Once I have my calories and macros set, I adjust them to fit my needs. I mostly add and subtract from carbs. For cutting, I aim for a caloric deficit that will result in 1lb/week loss. For bulking, I aim for a caloric surplus that will result in a .5lb/week increase in bodyweight. To maintain, I aim for a caloric goal that will result in neither weight gain nor weight loss.\n   * My current macros [for this cut](https://i.imgur.com/YxQJyL0.jpg) are as follows\n      * 2,300 calories\n      * 175 grams protein\n      * 100 grams fat\n      * 175 grams carbs\n\n###Intermittent Fasting\n\n* While macros alone allow some flexibility in my diet, intermittent fasting increases that flexibility to the point where a diet doesn't feel like dieting.\n* With my caloric goal and macros determined through the process shown above, I fit those macros into a specified eating window.\n* By fasting in the morning and only eating in a limited time-period, I can eat foods that may not seem to be \"diet friendly.\"\n* Throughout this most recent cut, I have been utilizing the [16:8 IF protocol](https://www.liftlearngrow.com/blog-page/what-is-intermittent-fasting).\n* I fast in the morning and eat large meals when I finally break my fast.\n\nBy combining Macros and Intermittent Fasting, I can remain on a diet even when I'm eating out or at a family gathering.\n\n---\n\n## **Motivation and staying with it**\n\n---\n\n\n* I still get private messages from my original posts. The most common question I get is \"How do you motivate yourself?\"\n* Although it seems like a simple question, it's actually very difficult to answer. I don't know how I motivated myself to begin doing any of these things. However, I do know what has helped me continue doing them.\n* I've distilled my process down to **2 key points.**\n\n###1. Habit\n\n* I currently go to the gym upon waking. Sometimes I'm not even fully awake until I'm in my car, on my way to the gym. My point with that is, I don't even think about it. It takes zero motivation because it's just my routine. I've created a habit and now it's just what I do.\n* I see it like how when I was a little kid, I didn't want to brush my teeth or wash my hands. After my mom made me do these things for a while, I stopped complaining. Now, many years later, I brush my teeth and wash my hands without even thinking about it because the habit was instilled in me long ago. Fitness can be the same.\n* Section off one hour of your day, every day, to go to the gym. At first it's difficult but after doing it for a while, it will become a habit and begin to be effortless. The same can be done with counting macros.\n\n###2. Interest\n\n* I do what's enjoyable. I can only make it so far with brute force. At some point, I have to actually like what I'm doing.\n* If I had to do an hour of cardio everyday to stay fit, I wouldn't be able to do it. I hate cardio.\n* I found I enjoyed training for bodybuilding so I did that for a while. Then bodybuilding training got boring to me so I switched to powerlifting. If this gets boring, I will switch to something else, like crossfit.\n* The key point is to keep it interesting. Very few people possess the kind of willpower required to consistently do something that is not enjoyable.\n\n---\n\nI owe a great deal of gratitude to this subreddit for giving me the tools I used to transform my life. These tools are not limited to diet and exercise strategies but also the success stories that provided me the inspiration I needed early on to keep pushing for my own goals. I couldn't have done this without you all. To show my gratitude, I want to give back what I got. I hope this post can provide some inspiration and knowledge to help anyone who is in a similar place I was.\n\n---\n\n\nI'm open to answer any questions you may have about any of this. I will also reply to all DMs.\n\nEdit: I do not use steroids. Only whey protein, preworkout, and multivitamin/fishoil.\n\n##**TL/DR - [Before and after](https://i.imgur.com/9VZ1z6u.jpg)**", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "OG Transformation Update - 4 Years Later", "post_ups": 3813, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8u28g4/og_transformation_update_4_years_later/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:10.322922", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "MrSnare", "post_created_utc": 1423219505.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2uz29s", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 550, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3802, "post_selftext": "Article here: http://www.thejournal.ie/calories-menus-1921415-Feb2015/\n\nA welcome change in my view.

We actually **have** had short stints of weightlifting in the past; in 7th grade (12 years old) for two semesters for 45 minutes a day, the first semester of freshmen year for an hour twice a week (football conditioning, though we both quit before the season), and the summer before our senior year for an hour twice a week (track conditioning, the sport we\u2019re varsity athletes in. They added conditioning during our senior year). Just wanted to start off by saying this because posted before and got a lot of skepticism so wanted to clarify early\n\n--- \n\nTraining: It was pretty variable at first. The first two months, we didn\u2019t even deadlift because our main gym didn\u2019t have it (hence the weak deadlift in comparison of the other lifts at the beginning). Still not on a reddit program but we have a structured routine now\n\nAbs whenever we feel like it. Mostly 2-3 times a week of a high intensity interval training just abs, and 1-2 times a week of weighted decline sit-ups for a few sets.\n\n\\+ means supersetted\n\nAll of the weights go increasingly higher. We train to failure. We recognize we could get more volume if we didn\u2019t, but both of us enjoy doing it to failure. That\u2019s just what works for us.\n\n---\n**Day 1**\n\nBarbell Bench Press (5x5) up to 225\n\nDumbbell Incline Press (4x8) up to 80 lb dumbbells\n\nDumbbell Flat bench (3x12) up to 65 pound barbells\n\nPull-ups (3xfailure) (around 15 each set, last one ~12)\n\n**Day 2:**\n\nStanding overhead press (4x8) + Barbell Bent-over-rows (4x10) up to 105\n\nDumbbell Shoulder shrugs (4x25) + Stiff-legged Dumbbell deadlift (4x5) up to 110\n\nDumbbell Curls (4x8 (each arm)) + Dumbbell Bent-over-rows (4x8) up to 70\n\nHammer Curls (3x15) up to 30 lb dumbbells\n\n**Day 3:**\n\nSquat (5x5) Up to 315\n\n(Yup, that's all for squat day. Though squats are almost always abs too)\n\n**Day 4:**\n\n Same as Day 1\n\n**Day 5:**\n\nDumbbell Overhead Press (5x8) up to 120 + Dumbbell shoulder shrugs (4x25) up to 105\n\nBarbell Curls (5x5) + Barbell rows (5x8) up to 100\n\nDumbbell hammer curls (3x15) up to 30 lb dumbbells\n\n**Day 6:**\n\nDeadlift (2x5, max out at 460/435, then 3x5, or just 5x5) up to 375\n\n**Day 7:** Rest (if we feel like it. Otherwise just repeat)\n\n---\n\nDiet: IIFYM. Generally eat healthier during cuts or otherwise we\u2019ll starve. Generally eat less healthy during bulks because otherwise can\u2019t get in enough food. We\u2019re college students with 2 meals a day so we make do with what we have. Oh, and also allergic to nuts, peanut butter, and all fish so that eliminates a lot of snacks people suggest. Pork rinds are a life saver. And coffee with Splenda.\n\nOnly macro goal was 140 grams of protein a day.\n\n--- \n\nFinal points: Just wanted to wrap up the post with some advice\n\n- Diet matters a lot. Was basically spinning our wheel for the first month because we continuously ate like shit while working out. We\u2019d say it\u2019s about 50/50 gym/diet. We don\u2019t even eat incredibly healthy; just get your protein in and count your calories. Don\u2019t drink soda unless you\u2019re realllly below on calories during a bulk or drinking diet (might get crucified for this but if it wasn\u2019t for artificial sweetners, every other day would\u2019ve been a cheat day)\n\n- **COUNT YOUR CALORIES**. Unless you eat the same thing every day. Mentioned in the last point but honestly think would look almost exactly the same as the before pictures if we didn\u2019t start counting them. It\u2019s a 5 minute a day commitment, it\u2019s not that hard.\n\n-  Don\u2019t make yourself miserable with your diet. We see a lot of people say \u201ceat 0 grams of sugar, only drink water, and the only carbs you should eat is rice, oatmeal, and those from vegetables\u201d. If that works for you, great! But if either of us were to stick to that, we would\u2019ve quit within a week. Find a healthy balance\n\n-  Consistency is key. Just go and stop making excuses. If you hate it, find something else. Fitness is a lifestyle and you\u2019re not going to stick to a 4-8 hour commitment of something you despise. Find another physical activity you enjoy. Swimming, rowing, calisthenics, rock climbing, biking, sking, skateboarding, biking; there\u2019s dozens upon dozens of different options. Just pick one and be consistent! \n\n---\n\nEdit: [I've been told to add our leg picture here, because of our low volume, we have chicken legs.

I was eating way too clean, eating way too little and exercising way too much. I was basically trying to maintain 4% BF for like...a decade.\n\nneedless to say, not a good thing. I was depressed, foggy headed, lethargic and unfocused all the time. a little over a year ago I got sick and I'll spare you the details but had a year from hell. Needed a bunch of surgeries, which led to me not being able to work out, and eat less. I dropped to about 140 pounds.\n\nI came out the other end of all this medical shit feeling like I had a second chance. That sounds corny as hell but its the best way to put it. I started eating way more, eating way smarter and exercising like a real person. (I spent years just fucking around at the gym, avoiding deadlifts and squats, doing too much cardio; led to a really lean frame, but under developed.)\n\nAnyways I am now 170 pounds 5'11. I am still bulking, and hoping to get to about 185-190 before cutting back down to a lean 175. Before and after pictures are about 14 months apart. Keep in mind that before picture was at like the worst, right after 3 surgeries; not pretty.\n\nDiet is not going to be anything you haven't heard before, I stick to mainly whole foods, lots of oats, sweet potatos and rice. Lots of chicken and lots of vegan protein powder (I love whey but cannot tolerate it.) I recently got some food allergy testing done and found I am \"sensitive\" to dairy and gluten and eggs (!!). While I don't necessarily plan on eating that way forever, I am currently dairy free, gluten free, egg free (kinda fucking sucks).....I want to see how I feel in a couple months and reintroduce foods from there. I am still able to hit my macros, just takes a bit more preparation (no more protein bars, lots of vegan protein powder and real foods: tuna, chicken, potatoes etc)\n\nHowever the majority of my bulking was done while eating all those goodies; lots of greek yogurt, eggs, some cheese, lots of nut butters, tons of vegetables, whole wheat bread, wraps, granola etc.\n\n\nI also quit drinking. Or at least am stopping for a long time. I never drank a huge amount, but its all subjective, I definitely had at least one drink every day. I always thought it would be the \"last thing to go\" but it was okay after a couple days. Its been since January 1st. Definitely notice a difference, feel a million times better, sleep better, no anxiety etc etc..\n\nI'm also off caffeine which kind of sucks too. I just wanted to quit all my vices, see how I feel, then decide which ones I may want to re-introduce.\n\n\nI follow a IIFYM style of eating but don't really go overboard. The last meal of everyday is usually some \"healthy\" style of dessert, typically a protein ice cream (protein powder, ice, nut milk in the vitamix, then depending on my remaining macros for the day, i will top that with granola, trail mix, chocolate chips, dates etc etc) this daily \"treat\" keeps me very satisfied.\n\n\nI started on a PHUL program, before transitioning to 5/3/1 and I am currently on my 4th week of nSuns which i think is my favourite so far. It offers tons pf variety and I enjoy the volume.\n\nlifts are:\n\nsquat 270\nbench 210\ndeadlift 350\nohp 140\n\nunfortunately I don't know my \"before\" #'s since I didn't really track them (fuckarounditis) I track everything now like a god damned maniac though. Makes all the difference in the world.\n\nMy current macros are\n\n2800 calories\n62 fat\n175 protein\n385 carbs\n\nI weigh myself everyday to get a weekly average and make sure to gain around 1.5 pounds a week, I typically change my macros slightly every couple weeks depending on the scale #'s\n\nI think thats it?

I'd also like to apologise for the length of the post.\n\nStarting off, I was diagnosed with anorexia at the age of 11. I skipped the entire final school year of primary school and was generally in a really dark place. Fast forward to 18. I had just left an emotionally abusive relationship, and I weighed just 44kg. Yes, 44kg. I could barely eat, let alone go to a gym. I had never touched a weight ever, I barely had energy to do anything.\n\nThe measurements:\n\nAge: 18\nHeight: 5'11\"\nWeight: 44kg (not a typo)\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/bynPD\n\nThis was 5-6 years after \"recovery\". \n\nSince then I met a girl. I actually smiled, for the first time since I could remember. Despite my social anxiety, my eating anxiety and general mess of a human being that I was, her and her family took me in. It took me 3 years of forcing down food to eventually get to the below:\n\nAge: 24\nHeight: 5'11\"\nWeight: 61kg\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/dVbTx\n\nI still only weighed 61kg but still hadn't been to a gym yet, that was what I wanted to do next. I did a bit of research and eventually started on the 5x5 SL on M/W/F with rest in between. This was the most I could manage, I ached, I was tired but I wanted this. I wanted this more than you could imagine. I started of off barely being able to finish a 5x5 squat with just the 20kg bar.\n\nSquat: 20kg\nOHP: 2x5 12kg\nDeadlift: 20kg\nBench: 3x5 20kg\nBarbell row: 3x5 15kg\n\nI realised 3 months in that I was no longer as small as I was. I was eating anything I could find, aided with 3 shakes a day of the MyProtein \"Hard Gainer Extreme\" shakes to help with the bulk. I had trained hard, but had got to a surprising point in my life.\n\nAge: 25\nHeight: 5'11\"\nWeight: 69kg\n\nI had finally put on the weight I wanted, and I could see a light in the tunnel. The pain I went through I proved to myself that I could do. I didn't need to prove it to anyone else, I needed to show myself\n\n(All 5x5)\nSquat: 60kg\nDeadlift: 57.5kg\nOHP: 25kg\nBench: 22.5kg\nRow: 20kg\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PeeHF\n\nAnd this pushed me further, to when I'm writing this post now.

I've shown myself what I can do, now I'm going to show everyone else what I can do.\n\nSince the start of all this, I've met a girl. Got engaged, had laser eye surgery, started and finished university, got a 8-5 job, saved up enough for a 10% deposit for a house with 6 months left, and shown myself that I'm not as pathetic as I thought I was. I hope this post shows a few lurkers out there that it's possible, it's definitely possible. Compared to 90% of the people on this sub I'm weak. But I won't be for long, because I won't let myself be for long.\n\nThank you Reddit, stay beautiful.\n\nObligatory happy picture!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/2GFUa\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Anorexia to Fitness - I Beat It.", "post_ups": 3756, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5ym51i/anorexia_to_fitness_i_beat_it/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:10.322922", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "AddictedToJackingOff", "post_created_utc": 1545057291.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "a70b60", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 3443, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3757, "post_selftext": "I'll start.

Net loss of around 150 lbs. \n \nDuring high school I played football for 3 years, stopped playing senior year. I continued to lift with a friend and cousin as my gym partners. I had a passion for weightlifting my entire time through high school and was very much into trying to lift heavy. My PRs at this time were : squats 500, deads 500, bench 300, leg Press 900. I always fluctuated around 200 lbs weight wise and that would depend on if it was the off-season or not. Overall I lifted for about 5 years during high school as well as my early college years. \n\nI was a smart kid and got into my dream school of Penn State. I started out strong but unfortunately, I fell into a very deep depression due to family health issues back home. I felt too far away, helpless, and I eventually collapsed. My stress from family health, school, as well as my continuing self-esteem issues from failure with women proved to be too heavy on me. I stopped taking care of myself, kept by myself, played video games nonstop, stopped weightlifting, and ate garbage. I stopped talking to my best friends as well. Near the end of my 2 year stay, I had ballooned and gained over 100 pounds. \n\nMy thoughts became twisted and I stopped communicating with my parents who became very worried about me. The depression eventually became too much and I became obsessed with death and dying. I wanted to end my own life and I felt powerless. I would spend a lot of sleepless nights standing at my apartment window thinking about jumping(I lived on a higher floor). The only thing that stopped me was knowing how painful it would be for my parents if I did this. \n\nMy family finally pulled the plug on me and decided I needed to be back home. The new plan was for me to go to community college and to start getting my shit together. Slowly, things started to fall back into place again. I got a part time job, started school again, and started to try and reconnect with people. I slowly started losing weight just from moving at work. After about 5 months I bought a gym membership but didn't use it. Around September 2015 I decided to go and lift weights a little bit nothing major. I tore my PCL in November so I stopped all activity. \n\nAfter recovering, I started lifting with my cousin in February of this year. Something a friend said to me that stuck was that \"you just have to treat lifting like it's your job, go and give it your all. If you don't, there's no point in going\". I went every day of the week doing a 5x5 6 day split with cardio and cardio only on Sundays. I would go to the gym for an hour and a half, 45 minutes lifting and 45 minutes of cardio. At this time weight was melting off. I have since cut down my time at the gym though I still go every day. \n\nEarly Routine\n\nI never had a \"set\" routine and just used my knowledge from previous years of lifting and football workouts. It proved to work before so I stuck with it\n\nM: chest/shoulders/tris/cardio\nT: back/bis/cardio\nW: legs/cardio\nTh: chest/shoulders/tris/cardio\nF: back/bis/cardio\nS: legs/cardio\nSu: cardio only\n\n\nCurrent Routine\n\nI now use a simple PPL routine that always has the same majors with minors cycled dependent on what I need to work on. \n\nM: back/bis\nDeads 4x5, 1 AMRAP\nBarbell rows 1 AMRAP\n\nT: chest/tris/shoulders\nBench 4x5, 1 AMRAP\nOverhead press 3x8 \n\nW: legs/abs \nSquats 3x5, 1 AMRAP\nLeg Press 5x5\n\nTh: back/bis\nBarbell rows 4x5, 1AMRAP\nDeads 1AMRAP\n\nF: chest/tris/shoulders\nOHP 4x5, 1 AMRAP \nBench 3x8\n\nS: legs/abs\nSquats 3x5, 1 AMRAP\nLeg Press 5x5\n\nSu: cardio\n\nCurrent lifting stats\n\nBench: 245\n\nSquat: 365\n\nDeads:325 (should be higher, really need to invest in a belt zzz) \n\nOHP: 130\n\nLeg Press: 600\n\n\n\n\nDiet\n\nAt the start I didn't take my diet seriously but I still ate at a deficit. It honestly didn't matter considering how many calories I was burning from cardio, work, and lifting. I ate around 2 thousand calories a day but was burning around 700-1000 depending on work. I still remember eating a lot of fast food while still rapidly losing weight. \n\nNow I try to eat around 1200-1600 calories since I've slowed down cardio. I eat clean for the most part cutting out almost all carbs(except for my recent increase in alcohol intake from a growth in social life) eating fats, protein, and veggies. \n\nWater also has been my best friend as it helped to cut calories instead of sugary drinks. It also helped as I finally started to interpret thirst as thirst and not hunger. \n\nOverall, I'm absolutely happy about how far I've come. I was staring into hell and am fortunate enough to be where I am today. My goal weight is around 170-175 but overall want to be cut so plans may change when I reach that weight. I was lucky enough to have a good amount of my muscle still. I'm still super tough on myself and get down about where I am currently but 35 pounds is a drop in a hat compared to 150. Hopefully in a few months from now I can post an update showing that I hit that goal. I appreciate anyone who took time out of their busy day to read my story. I hope that this pushes anyone out there struggling with what I went through and gives them motivation to turn things around. \n\nIf I'm missing any information or if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask. I'll be as honest as I possibly can. \n\nTL;DR: former weight lifter, gained a massive amount of weight due to depression and became suicidal. Turned everything around and  lost 150 lbs in a little over a years time.\n\nEdit: I never thought this would blow up the way it has! I'm still trying to answer all questions while I'm working and doing other things. Thank you all for such kind words it really means a lot to me.

But the triceps are a unique muscle group that needs to be trained in various ways to maximize growth.\n\n>**ANATOMY**\n \n>There are three heads to the triceps muscle; the [long. lateral, and medial head]( http://www.seannal.com/images/tricep-heads.jpg). \n\n>* The long head starts (originates) on the scapula (shoulder blade)\n\n>* The lateral and medial heads both start on the [humerus](http://thumb101.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/1569284/190913903/stock-photo--d-rendered-illustration-of-the-female-humerus-bone-back-view-190913903.jpg) (bone of the upper arm)\n\n>All three heads then come together to a single tendon and attach (insert) on to the [ulna](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Ulna_-_anterior_view.png). \n\n>A really interesting fact about the triceps is that different muscle fiber types make up different heads of the muscle.  \n\n>* Medial Head\n       >* Primarily made up of small type I fibers (\u201cslow twitch\u201d muscle fibers, which are used in lower intensity exercises. These fibers are involved in muscular endurance/high rep training)\n\n>* Lateral head \n       >* Predominantly made up of large type IIb fiber types (\u201cfast twitch\u201d muscle fibers, which are used during high intensity exercise.  This fiber type is involved in high force, power, and speed generation.)\n\n>* Long head \n       * Made up of a mixture of both fiber types\n\n>**FUNCTION**\n\n>The function of every muscle depends on its origins and insertions. If a muscle crosses a joint, it will act on that joint. For example, since the triceps go across the elbow and attach on the forearm, flexing the triceps will affect the elbow joint.  More specifically, the triceps will [extend the elbow]( http://www.fitnessreal.es/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/flexion-and-extension-14398F2FAC42C0BD480.gif). This is their primary action. \n\n>But remember that the long head of the triceps starts at the shoulder blade. This means that the triceps must also affect movement at the shoulder joint.  The long head of the triceps plays a role in: \n\n>* [adducting your arm](http://machinedesign.com/site-files/machinedesign.com/files/uploads/2014/07/What%E2%80%99s-the-diff-Abd-AddWEB.jpg) \n\n>* [shoulder extension](https://breddydotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/shoulder-flexion-and-extension.png).  \n\n>**TRAINING TIPS**\n\n>Due to the diversity in muscle fibers that make up the triceps, it is very important to train them in low, medium, and high rep ranges to attain maximal growth (the medial head is used primarily for light/high rep exercises, the lateral head for heavy/low rep exercise, and the long head is used for all exercises).\n\n>**LOW REP TRAINING**\n\n>It is recommended to use compound movements to target your triceps. This is because using heavy weights for isolation exercises (such as skull crushers) can be very detrimental to your elbow health.  Use compound movements for your heavier triceps training.\nThe best compound movements, in my opinion, for triceps growth are:\n\n>* [Close grip bench press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ruy94BZ6FmE) \n\n>* [Weighted dips](http://youtu.be/72gpRKE_CZI?t=1m55s) \n\n>The grip that I use for close grip bench press is slightly less than shoulder width. The closer your grip, the more activation you will get in your triceps (to an extent). In the video linked with \u201cclose grip bench press\u201d, Jim Stoppani cites a study where going closer than shoulder width doesn\u2019t stimulate any further triceps activation. It is also important to remember that positioning your hands too close can place a great deal of stress on your wrists.  \n\n>Weighted dips are also a great exercise to attain triceps mass. When doing these, try to stay as upright as possible.  The more your torso leans over, the more your chest will activate. \n\n>**HIGH REP TRAINING**\n\n>For your higher rep training, it is best to use isolation exercises. My favourites are:\n\n>* [Cable pushdowns](http://youtu.be/QPGwI4d-eHY?t=13s) \n\n>* [Skull crushers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKbDU850mbE) \n\n>* [Overhead dumbbell extensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbX7Wd8jQ-Q) \n\n>Overhead tricep movements are said to primarily target the long head, while pushdown movements target the lateral head. \n\n>Skull crushers are a great triceps exercise.  A trick that can be used to maximize triceps activation during this exercise is to allow your elbows to go back (shoulder flexion) at the bottom of the movement, and then as you push the weight up with your triceps, bring your elbows back to the normal position (extend the shoulder joint). Mark Rippetoe demonstrates this very well in [this video](http://youtu.be/-rh3MHnRI_I?t=10m52s). \n\n>**CABLE VS BAR PUSHDOWNS**\n\n>The reason why I prefer cable pushdowns over bar pushdowns goes back to the function of the triceps.  Remember that the triceps also play a role in shoulder extension.  Shoulder extension occurs when your upper arm (humerus) is behind your body (this can be seen under the clickable link for shoulder extension under \u201cfunction\u201d).  When you are using a bar, your legs limit your range of motion. When you use a cable, you can fully contract each triceps by not only extending your elbow, but by also slightly extending your shoulder. \n\n>[This great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPGwI4d-eHY) by IFBB Pro Ben Pakulski demonstrates how to perform triceps pushdowns correctly.\n\n>**SUMMARY** \n\n>For a full triceps workout, I would recommend doing one compound movement, one isolation movement, and one overhead isolation movement.  Remember to train your triceps in all rep ranges, through different elbow positions (overhead, pushdown, etc) to attain maximal growth in each head. \n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Triceps extend the shoulder and extend the elbow\n\n* There are three heads to the triceps, each of which are composed of different muscle fibers that are active during different work loads\n\n* Overhead movements target the long head, pushdowns target the lateral head\n\n* Train the triceps in high, medium, and low rep ranges to attain maximal growth\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Triceps 101: An Anatomical Guide to Training", "post_ups": 3742, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2x4iwj/triceps_101_an_anatomical_guide_to_training/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:10.322922", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Antranik", "post_created_utc": 1444063933.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1444148314.0, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "3nldsg", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 298, "post_num_crossposts": 1, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3723, "post_selftext": "###This is a follow along video where I guide you through several poses to help limber you up and give you better posture: **[35 Minute Yoga Video for Posture with Antranik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAmc9SNciTg&index=15&list=PLOj76wV2WfPuKI11aVaswYJQjhOpgcFOc)**\n\n* You could do this anytime, especially if you're looking for something to do on rest days.

Over the years I had collected a ton of moves that I personally enjoyed greatly. Then, earlier this year I was doing my yoga teacher training with Dan Ward and he inspired me to make use of my notes. So, this video is a culmination of all the things I find scrumptious, but organized into a logical sequence. \n\n* The logical sequence meaning... we warm up with gentle prone or kneeling poses (childs pose, wrist mobility, cat cow, sphinx pose, wake up the core with bird dog etc). Then we move onto standing poses (lunges, sun salutations) where we can intensify things. Eventually we transition slowly back to the mat, doing a bit more deep release with seated/kneeling poses (quad/hipflexor and hamstring stretches) to supine bridges and twists until finally we rest.\n\n* If you want the full list of poses and what they do, read [this comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3nldsg/after_months_of_editing_i_am_happy_to_share_with/cvq7e8g)", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "After months of editing, I am happy to share with you my first yoga video: 35 Minute Yoga Video for Improving Posture with Antranik", "post_ups": 3723, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3nldsg/after_months_of_editing_i_am_happy_to_share_with/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:10.322922", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "ph4il", "post_created_utc": 1475615905.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1475662118.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "55vvkj", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 256, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3703, "post_selftext": "I've never done this before but i just wanted to give some feedback about my weight loss / gym training which i have done for about a year now (started end of September 2015).\n\nSo - i just finished looking through my pictures from last year until now and i realized how much weight i have lost. Up until now it's about 35kg (77 pounds). I still haven't reached my goal yet but i'm feeling it getting warmer every week and every month.\n\nI have done nothing out of the ordinary than just getting my lazy ass to the gym 3-5 times a week (in the beginning 5 times, now about 3 times) and just sweating the shit off of me. Primarily i've done more cardio in the beginning and kept lifting to a minimum - but some months ago i realized that it's kind of fun, too. So now i have a good mix of lifting and cardio and i really enjoy it.\n\nI didn't just go to the gym regularly though - i have changed my eating habits completely. No shitty food, every day cooking with healthy, at first weird looking green stuff (a good mix of vegetables, meat and carbs - no Keto diet or something else). But hey - i like it now (except the time consuming cooking, geez).\n\nSo yeah - at the end some pics because without pics it didn't happen, right? http://imgur.com/a/GdkKM\n\n\nI hope someone who reads this and is in the state i was a year ago can find some motivation out of it. Just go and keep on it. You are helping yourself so much. I really can't describe how i am feeling now compared to my old self one year ago. It's just plain awesome.\n\n\nOh yeah, almost forgot the important stuff: 26 years old, 1,79m (5,10 feet) and currently 102kg (224 pounds). My next goal is 90kg (198 pounds) - after that i will see where it gets me :-)\n\n\nEdit: Sorry, i forgot the really important stuff to not be a bragger (i really didn't want that). Also i don't know if i got the translation of the excercises correct since i'm not a native english speaker.\n\n\nAll excercises are 4 sets with 10 repetitions.\n\n\nI started with \"beginner\" excercises, like:\n\n* leg press, started with 60kg up to 155kg\n\n* leg extension, started with 35kg up to 50kg\n\n* leg curl, started with 54kg up to 70kg\n\n* chest presses, started with 33kg up to 50kg\n\n* butterfly, started with 33kg up to 50kg\n\n* neck shoulder press (?), started with 15kg up to 30kg\n\n* lat pulldown, started with 47kg up to 65kg\n\n* seated machine rows (?), started with 35kg up to 50kg\n\n\n\nAfter that, took me about 3-4 months, i switched the excercises:\n\n* smith machine - hack squat, started with 10kg up to 25kg\n\n* lunges, started with own weight and up to 25kg\n\n* incline barbell bench press, started with 10kg up to 25kg\n\n* lat pulldown (tight grip?), started with 50kg up to 60kg\n\n* back extensions (only because i had some trouble with cycling), started with 40kg up to 55kg\n\n\n\nFor cardio i mostly cycled for about 1 hour after the lifting. I also mixed it up with a cross-trainer and cycling (30 minutes each). Quite recently i've stepped it up with a machine where i can walk stairs - don't know how it's called though (Edit: [StairMaster!](http://fitnessequipmentprofessionals.com/images/stories/virtuemart/category/stairmaster_sm5_d164.jpg) - this guy is a total bitch, holy shit).

I recall desperately attempting all the cardio I could muster in vain attempts to gain some \u201cshape\u201d, to no avail. Obviously. \n\nIn 2014, I was diagnosed with PCOS. Over the course of two years, I\u2019d gained nearly 40 lbs (some of that being muscle as I\u2019d started lifting by that point) and felt utterly defeated. My fianc\u00e9 looked like a chiseled Greek god while I felt like his chubby, awkward, insecure girlfriend that people probably pitied. \n\nAfter years of crippling insecurity and painfully slow results, I decided in 2016 that I\u2019d be the best I could be for both myself and my fianc\u00e9 - no excuses. If I gave up, I was weak. If I made excuses, I was weak. I lost 15 lbs, but in the process lost a fair amount of muscle due to a restrictive, extended ketogenic diet (I was also not meeting my daily calorie goals). That\u2019s when I decided to turn to science and strategy, and was also introduced to T-Nation and Dr. Brett Contreras. *Seriously, if you haven\u2019t heard of this guy, you should probably check him out.*\n\n2017 began with a week solely dedicated to light weight and harboring mind-muscle connection through a variety of isolation and unilateral moves. Calories were raised to 2,000 and carbs were raised as well (which made me nervous, having had PCOS as we are always preached to about low-carb this, low-carb that). Once I had the ability to easily activate each target muscle upon mental command, I began the split I\u2019m still currently using today, essentially starting over from \u201cscratch\u201d with light weight, only allowing for progressive overload once I could move through working reps with the added weight while feeling that burning, sickly satisfying activation through the full ROM. This method subsequently put inches on my glutes while carving inches from my waist in 2017 alone. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCurrently, here\u2019s what my workout splits and nutrition stats look like:\n\n**MEASURES:**\n* 2010, 100 lbs (approximate): B 32\u201d, W 26\u201d, H 33-34\u201d\n* 2015, 140 lbs: B 35\u201d, W 28\u201d, H 39\u201d\n* Current, 125 lbs (obviously have had a B.A.): B 37\u201d, W 24\u201d, H 37\u201d\n\n*Body composition has changed ENTIRELY since 2010 - I weigh 25 lbs more but am actually leaner and curvier than I ever have been. I can fit into clothes from high school, but due to muscle development things are tight in the gluteal and thigh area.\n\n **NUTRITION:**\n*Currently minimal macro tracking (I do track protein daily) and eating intuitively to gain / maintain muscle. This will change soon for the wedding cut.  \n\n1,800 - 2,000 calories \n\nP: 150g MINIMUM - I always track to ensure I meet this goal daily\nC: 160 - 200g - I\u2019m cognizant of this as well so as to not overdo it or choose poor carb sources \nF: 60 - 70g \n\n**WORKOUTS:**\n*xx = superset*\n\n*Please note that I don\u2019t religiously count reps, I instead choose to focus on how my mind-muscle connection is that day and will adjust my workout and set range accordingly. If, for example, I\u2019ve had adequate sleep and a good pre-workout meal, activation will be at 100% and I can focus on progressive overload and push my limits that day with weight. If not, I\u2019ll put more focus on warming up the target muscle until it can be activated, even if it does require 15 minutes.

I went off to college, drank a bit and dropped out after one semester. I found myself sitting at home every day, addicted to World of Warcraft. I religiously played (For the Horde!) every day. And by every day, I mean I started playing when I first woke up and didn\u2019t stop until I felt like going to bed. I craved competition and since I wasn\u2019t getting it from sports anymore, I turned to WoW (PvP and progressive raiding). I continued this lifestyle until I got up to 200 lbs. (I\u2019m 5\u20197 btw and couldn\u2019t get over 160 in high school). It was hard to look at myself in the mirror anymore so I decided to join a gym. \n\n\nI went around and did all the machines and left. I had no idea what I was doing but I kept doing it. I was unhappy with the results so I started researching and reading about fitness. I found it to be fascinating. I was learning so much about training but neglected the diet side (bad idea). I was getting stronger but wasn\u2019t getting the body I wanted. I kept trying to meal prep and kept failing miserably. I still can\u2019t hardly eat chicken and rice because I was trying to revolve my life around it back then. I would never stick to it. Eventually I discovered IIFYM and it completely changed everything. Using MyFitnessPal made it a breeze and I started seeing results. I loved learning about it so I ended up going back to school and getting my degree in Exercise Science. I kept studying and kept lifting. I never followed any specific routines such as 5x5. I would watch a video on YouTube and try their workouts.\n\n\nI\u2019m currently doing a BB/Powerlifting split I just put together:\n\nMonday \u2013 Heavy Push\n\nTuesday \u2013 Light Pull\nWednesday \u2013 Heavy Legs\n\nThursday \u2013 Light Push\n\nFriday \u2013 Heavy Pull\n\nSaturday \u2013 Light Legs\n\nSunday \u2013 Optional Arms\n\n**Light means bodybuilding rep schemes, not necessarily light weight. I\u2019ve always done a ton of volume so it\u2019s never bothered me.\n\n\nMy friend recently did a powerlifting meet and asked if I would do the next one with her so that\u2019s why I started doing this. Does anyone have any advice on powerlifting, I\u2019m definitely new to it. Any advice on a routine would be appreciated. \n\n\nI\u2019ve waited so long to post my transformation because I\u2019m always blown away by everyone else\u2019s that I see so I always talk myself out of it.

I try to get 100g of protein minimum, but my main focus has always been calories. During my bulk, I just ensured that I was eating 500 calories above my TDEE. By the time I got to my cut, I had some idea of how my body reacted to the amount of food I ate, so I was eating around 1200-1500 calories.  \n  \n***Bulking***  \n  \n/r/gainit helped a lot on my initial bulk. I used a BMR calculator which showed that my maintenance was around 2400 cals. I started at 500 above that, but this escalated as I wanted get as big as possible. This was also partly because I was watching Rich Piana's \"Bigger By The Day\", the best YouTube series of all time (RIP Rich). My diet was something like this, with snacks in between.  \n  \n*Breakfast* - Peanut butter on toast. All milk tea. Banana  \n*Lunch*      - Sandwich, nature valley bar, crisps.  \n*2nd Lunch* - This was maybe once or twice a week, but more often towards the end of my bulk. Usually sushi  \n*Dinner*     - Varied, living at home and eating whatever my parents make. Usually around 600-1000 calories  \n*Evening Meal* - Tuna or egg mayo sandwich, protein shake (2 scoops whey, 500ml milk)  \n  \n***Cutting***  \n  \nCutting for the most part was not difficult for me as i've always been skinny and am used to eating small amounts of food. I ate less, added 20-60 mins cardio around 3 times a week, and started cycling more often. I still ate snacks, but less often during the last couple of months of my cut to lose the last few lbs.  \n  \n*Breakfast* - All milk tea  \n*Lunch*      - None. Maybe a banana before working out  \n*Dinner*     - Varied. Same as with bulking, I'm living at home and eat whatever my parents make. Usually 600-1000 calories.  \n*Evening*   - 100g Low-Fat Cottage Cheese. Protein shake (2 scoops whey, 250ml semi-skimmed milk, 250ml water)  \n  \nCurrently doing a slow, clean bulk. My diet's similar to cutting, but for breakfast i'm having scrambled eggs and toast. Going to slowly add more calories and plan on adding maybe 1-2kg of body weight a month.  \n  \n**Exercise**  \n  \nI started with Stronglifts 5x5 for the first 6 months, and I honestly wouldn't recommend it unless you just want to squat every workout, because I hated that shit. I got big legs with a lagging upper body, and my less than stellar form on squats, combined with regularly increasing loads, made my pre-existing knee issue worse, causing me to regularly take months off from squatting.\n  \nSince mid 2015 i've been running this split around 4-5 days a week. The only part I follow every workout is the heavy compounds at the start. I switch around some exercises depending on what I feel like doing that day, and what equipment is available.  \n  \n(Format is Sets x Reps)  \n  \n***Chest/Tris***  \nBench Press - 4x5  \nDecline Bench Press - 5x8-12  \nDumbell Flies - 5x8-12  \nDip Machine - 5x8-12  \nTricep Pushdowns - 5x8-12  \n  \n***Back/Bis***  \nDeadlift - 3x5  \nYates Rows - 5x8-10  \nLat Pullover Machine - 3x8-12  \nLat Pulldowns - 3x8-12  \nPreacher Curl Machine - 4x8-12  \nAlternating Dumbell Curls - 4x8-12  \n  \n***Shoulders/Tris***  \nClose Grip Bench Press - 4x5  \nDumbell Press - 5x8-12  \nLateral Raises - 5x8-12  \nSeated Rear Delt Flies - 4x8-12  \nTricep Pushdowns - 5x8-12  \n  \n***Legs/Bis***  \nSquat - 4x5  \nHamstring Curls - 5x8-12  \nLeg Extensions - 4x8-12  \nPreacher Curl Machine - 4x8-12  \nAlternating Dumbell Curls - 4x8-12  \n  \nAdded a Cardio/Abs day during the last couple of months of my cut.  \n   \n***Cardio/Abs***  \n30-60 minutes Treadmill at 10km/h  \nDecline Weighted Sit-ups - 5x8-10  \nHanging Leg Raises - 3x6-8  \nAb machine where it looks like you're sucking your own dick - 3x8-10  \n1 minute planks - 4 sets  \n  \nI also recently did a cycle of Smolov JR for bench which really pushed my bench up. Highly recommended if you're lagging on bench. Just input your 1RM [here](http://www.smolovjr.com/smolov-jr-calculator/) and it makes the programme for you.  \n  \n**Lessons learnt, and what next**  \n  \nThe only reason I made any gains is because I stayed consistent. In the 3 years i've been lifting, i've seen people make progress that made mine look shit, and others that haven't made any progress, mainly due to consistency.  \n  \nI'm never going on a dreamer bulk again. I made some strength gains, but in no way did they justify the amount of fat I gained. I could've made those gains without putting that much weight on, and it would have made cutting easier. Currently doing a clean bulk with a goal of 1-2kg gains a month. Also, joint pains will get better or go away if you take some time off or stop doing exercises that aggravate them. I used to fight through them and it only made things worse.  \n  \nI hope this post is helpful for anybody in any way, i'm happy to answer any questions you have.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "M/22/5\u20195\" (132>181>134) 3 Year Progress.

I had reached my halfway point in my weight-loss journey, back when my goal weight was 150 lbs. \n\nHere is a picture of me at my highest weight. I was 9 months pregnant (though you would never be able to tell) with my daughter. I don't know what my weight was at. I wouldn't let the doctor tell me anymore, but I'd guess I was at or close to around 300 lbs, at 5'5\u201d  http://imgur.com/rq7bacF\n\n3 months after I gave birth to my daughter I weighed in at 270 lbs. Here is the picture someone took of me that made me realize I had to get my shit together. http://imgur.com/MicopmA\n\nI'll go into it more if people are curious (though I didn't want to focus on it too much with the initial post) but I lost 110 lbs through mild cardio and calorie counting, and somewhere along the way developed bulimia and had to be hospitalized and almost died.  http://imgur.com/nq3eWdk \nWhen I got out of the hospital I was too afraid to diet and exercise. I was the only parent my daughter had, and I was afraid she would become an orphan. So instead of dieting or just being normal and healthy, I went back to my over-eating ways and a year later, this was me all over again. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/AK9Muz1\n\nSo after a year being recovered, I worked with my therapist and doctors and started losing weight again. This time the right way. The first 60 lbs I lost was just through calorie counting (this as when I made my reddit account). Then I did 20-30 min of cardio 2-4 times a week, mostly walking. Then I started swimming. Then biking. Then running. I was vegetarian for a while. Then vegan. Then I did Keto a little, then I did maybe 5-6 other things I can't remember anymore. All the while I always counted calories. These days I pretty much just count calories and try and get around 100 g of protein a day and that\u2019s pretty much it. I started lifting weights a little over nine months ago, and this is my progress from month 0-6 (though the before picture is from a year before I started lifting) http://imgur.com/raEKCSb and here is a picture taken of me at 9 months of lifting (though I don't see much of a difference between 6 and 9 months, even though my strength has gone up.) http://imgur.com/rhxwSzR\n\nMy one rep max lifts are\n\nBench \u2013 110 lbs\nDead-Lift \u2013 190 lbs\nSquat \u2013 200 lbs (at parallel) \n\nWARNING: If loose skin grosses you out, you might not want to click on the next two links\n\nHere is an album of my \u201cmuscles\u201d from 6 months of weight lifting. http://imgur.com/a/PA063 I also documented my loose skin retraction on my midsection (just because SO MANY people had questions about it and there is hardly any information out there) http://imgur.com/F4TpOpf \n\nI have not lost weight in over 18 months, but have gone from a size 8 to a size 4 due to the strength training. I am currently at 138 lbs at 5'6\u201d. Guess what? I GREW AN INCH. My doctor told me that he often sees people get taller as they lose large amounts of weight because their spine becomes less compressed. Crazy right? My shoe size also went down. \n\nI still eventually want to hit my new goal weight of 130, but obviously I'm in no hurry to get there. I have a really bad shoulder that I have dislocated dozens of times and am now looking to get surgery to fix it, and the doc says I might not be able to lift for 6 months because of it. This is something I have cried about multiple times in the past 2 weeks. \n\nAnyway, that's me in all my raw glory. I'm proud of myself. Excited to see where I am next cake-day.

I love this place. I lurk on here with a couple different accounts but never actually submit anything. I'm currently recovering from a surgery and had nothing to do so I decided to compile a transformation post that I've been wanting to do for a while now. Here you go!\n\n**My transformation began in 2011.**\n\n*  This is a picture of me in 2011 weighing roughly 240lb @ 5'10\" age 22. [Clinically obese, class II.](http://i.imgur.com/JEKYYNg.jpg)\n\n*  Shortly after that picture was taken I decided I needed to get my weight under control. I had become clinically obese and I wasn't happy physically, emotionally or spiritually. \n\n*  Having no experience with the gym or dieting I didn't know where to begin. I'd heard of counting calories and I knew \"running makes you fit\" so I downloaded Lose It for iPhone and began eating in a deficit and running on an elliptical a couple times a week.\n\n[Here is fat me running on an elliptical...] (http://i.imgur.com/lDMgVmf.jpg)\n\n* In the beginning it was really easy to lose weight, the hard part was sticking to it. Going into a caloric deficit from eating an obese diet such as my own was as simple as cutting out sugar. For a while this was awesome. I cut out sugar, boom, 10lbs like that. I stopped eating breads, boom, 5lbs like that. Mind you, I was running on an elliptical daily. I wasn't sure what was working so I kept doing it all.\n\n*  This strategy got me down to about 180lbs as you can see in [this really shitty selfie (circa Sept. 2012).](http://i.imgur.com/wF3tvbR.jpg)\n\n\n*  I got so good at being a cardio bunny that I hiked the Grand Canyon. [It was epic!! (Nov. 2012).](http://i.imgur.com/b8KGeW5.jpg)\n\n*  In the above picture (Grand Canyon) I was doing an insane amount of cardio and trying to remain in a caloric deficit. I was getting pretty skinny but was still fat. I think the term to describe myself at this point would be skinnyfat...\n\n*  I kept using my strategy of caloric deficit and high volume cardio through 2012 and most of 2013. My tricks for dropping weight had now resorted to a more severe zero carb diet.\n\n**2013 is when shit got real for me.** \n\n*  Through this journey I had struggled with a dependency on prescription medications and alcohol. **On January 2nd 2013 I decided I needed to get a grip. I got clean, sober and quit smoking.** \n\n*  Getting sober was the best thing I have ever done for myself mentally, physically and spiritually. Not to mention getting to drop those excess alcohol calories allowed me to eat a lot more! I love food...\n\n*  After getting clean and sober I started weight training. I had no idea what I was doing and stayed in a severe caloric deficit. [So I got really skinny...(July 2013 roughly 155-160lb)](http://i.imgur.com/CQtMdX7.png)\n\n*  In the above picture (July 2013) I was literally malnourished. I was living in Africa trying to remain zero carb because I was deathly afraid of getting fat. Mind you, most of the food I was given while I lived there were carbs so I mostly just didn't eat. I would pick up cans of tuna when they were available... It was pretty crazy looking back.\n\n*  When I returned to the US in September 2013 I quickly plumped up. I read The Paleo Solution by Robb Wolfe and the Primal Blueprint by Mark Sisson and I thought Paleo might be the answer.\n\n*  Eating Paleo and not counting calories I quickly put on fat. I was under the assumption that a calorie was NOT a calorie and as long as you suppressed insulin levels by not eating carbs you could eat as much as you wanted without getting fat. I read both of Dr. Phinney and Volek's books on ketosis and felt like I had a pretty good understanding of the subject. But as I found out time and time again during this journey, what works for one person does not necessarily work for another. \n\n*  Upon my arrival home I also got really serious about weight training. I started squatting heavy(after reading Starting Strength by Mark Rippetoe and I found a new passion in my life. [This was November of 2013. I thought I was freaking MASSIVE!](http://i.imgur.com/EPP71su.jpg)\n\n*  Soon after this picture was taken I decided I needed to show off my gainz and started tracking my macros. I lowered my calories pretty aggressively and continued to lift heavy. [I took this photo last week (March 23rd 2014).](http://i.imgur.com/GSDMvWT.jpg)\n\n \n\n*  Going from extremely obese to pretty ripped I had accumulated some loose skin. Having known this was an inevitability for a while I had made the decision that I would get it surgically removed. [I took this photo March 24th 2014, the night before my operation.](http://i.imgur.com/wDZdndH.jpg)\n\n\nAnd [here I am today, post op tubes and all...](http://i.imgur.com/XLGMNYs.jpg)\n\n\n**The fastest and most substantial results I got over this period were from lifting heavy weights and tracking macros.** Going into a caloric deficit definitely got me to lose weight but not until I started tracking macros with goals to hit regarding fats, proteins and carbs did I see substantial change.\n\nMy macros during this cut were **220 protein, 150 carbs and 60 fats**. As I stalled I reduced calories from carbs, 50 at a time. I ended this cut reducing carbs in this fashion twice, consuming only 50 carbs a day for the last few weeks. For most people this would be way too aggressive of a caloric deficit but I know my body pretty well and I may have suffered some metabolic issues from my zero carb days. Also I cut out cardio all together.\n\n**About weight training...**\n\nI do a pretty high volume body building split because I enjoy lifting weights. I don't want to be in and out of the gym as quickly as possible and I don't \"feel\" low volume training. It has changed a little bit over time but this is my current lifts and split...\n\n\n                    .\nMy current lifts are as follows:\n\nBench - 225lb 1RM\n\nSquat - 315lb (working set)\n\nDeadlift - 365lb (working set)\n\nI haven't maxed on my deads or squat since December.\n\n4 day split - Legs/Chest&Tris/Back&Bis/Shoulders&Tris rest repeat.\n\nLegs - \n\n* Squats 5x5\n\n* Deadlift 5x5\n\n* Leg Press 4x8\n\n* Leg Extension 4x12\n\n* Hamstring Curl 4x12\n\nChest&Tris -\n\n* Flat Bench 5x5\n\n* Incline Bench 5x5\n\n* Incline DB Flies 4x8\n\n* Weighted Dips 4x8\n\n* Decline Skull Crushers 4x8\n\nBack&Bis -\n\n* Pull ups 5xAMAP\n\n* Pendlay Rows 5x5\n\n* Kroc Rows 4x8\n\n* Lat Pulldown 4x8\n\n* Hammer Curls 5x10\n\n* 3 sets of 21s for dat hypertrophy\n\nShoulders&Tris -\n\n* OHP 5x5\n\n* Lateral DB Raises 5x10\n\n* Facepulls 4x8\n\n* Upright Rows 4x8\n\n* Front Raise 4x8\n\n* Weighted Dips 4x8\n\n* Skull Crushers or French Press 4x8\n\nThings of particular interest:\n\n*  **A calorie is a calorie.** Although peoples bodies respond to different foods differently, if you over-consume calories it will result in fat accumulation.\n\n*  **Tracking macronutrients is huge.** Although not as important as overall calories, getting adequate protein and keeping your carbs and fats in check is crucial to reaching any physique goals.\n\n*  **I made most of my gains while in a caloric deficit.** Although my lifts did not go up dramatically they steadily went up over time while I was losing weight. I attribute this to consuming adequate proteins and fats and smart training. I know scientifically it is almost impossible but I do think it can be done especially for a new lifter.\n\n*  **After reading endless books on diet and exercise (including Starting Strength), some of the most valuable info for me has come from watching youtube videos.** People like Chris Jones of Physiques of Greatness and Matt Ogus from Legends of Aesthetics are very knowledgeable about different exercises and how to properly perform them. They also have their diets dialed in. Although I am a man of science and greatly value empirical data, anecdotal evidence definitely has an important role in personal health.\n\nThis journey is not over. In the beginning I did this to be fit because I didn't want to be the \"fat guy\" any more but it has evolved into so much more. It's a lifestyle that I have found a passion for. I've always viewed myself as a geek but in the last year I have started to identify more as a weight lifter. I haven't gone full bro but I do eat a lot of chicken breast out of Tupperware :-P. I'm currently stupid happy. People ask me all the time why I smile so much. I tell them it's because my life is tremendous. I'm not lying either. Becoming more active, dropping weight and lifting what used to be immovable objects showed me that I was capable of a lot more than I had thought possible. Without these things I don't think I would've ever had the courage to quit drugs and alcohol(and I like the way I look!). \nedit: [picture of me now, stupid happy](http://i.imgur.com/Lmb8HHh.jpg)\n\nThanks /r/Fitness \n\nTL;DR: [Before](http://i.imgur.com/JEKYYNg.jpg) and [after](http://i.imgur.com/wDZdndH.jpg)", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "My 3 year transformation from clinically obese (class II) to ripped.

I have a mild disability called Erb\u2019s Palsy which has given me a 3\u201d difference in arm length.  Being able to finally do this was super important to me.  I've tried to do one about once a week but it's always felt like I was literally tearing my shoulder to pieces.\n\nThe biggest help, I think, was learning how to actually activate my lats in the deadlift.  Once I figured out how to do that for stability, I was able to get them more active in the bench, and in variations of rows (lat pull down, seated row, t bar, etc).  I believe that I have always been able to activate the left lat properly but not the right one, which really shows in my physique (and stability on both sides of my body).  Lately I\u2019ve been treating the LPD as a shorter movement and trying to very specifically pull with even force on both sides.  \n\nGenerating evenly distributed force is something that\u2019s always been an issue for all of my lifts.  Learning a better activation will hopefully get my bench out of the gutter as well.  I\u2019m heavily incorporating incline bench, slingshot bench and dumbbell bench in my current training cycle to give myself some additional practice while building my lagging stabilizer muscles. Current program: GZCL Jacked & Tan.

I had no knowledge of fitness or nutrition, and I was weak and skinny fat. As someone who previously hated exercise, to the point that walking downstairs was sometimes a little too much effort, I never thought I would end up falling in love with fitness, and learning so much; but [here we are today](https://i.imgur.com/pmyL9Jz.jpg)!\n\nThroughout the past two years I've learnt a lot, and I hope to share with you the things I wish I knew at the start.\n\n---\n\n# The Beginning (3 July 2016)\n\nPics: [Front](https://i.imgur.com/b4aicP5.jpg) / [Back](https://i.imgur.com/T4kNsUx.jpg)\n\nWeight: 51kg / 113lbs\n\n**Exercise**\n\nI joined the gym and got a free session with a PT. My routine was cardio, cardio and more cardio. From the top of the Stairmaster I could see the free weight area, which looked a lot more fun than walking up infinite steps.\n\nThe free weights area was dominated by big scary men and I wasn't ready to cluelessly wander in and make a fool of myself. I looked on reddit and youtube and learnt the basics. Then, armed with my YouTube powerlifting lessons, I entered the free weights area and managed to squat 40kg, deadlift 30kg and bench the bar... *just* ! (Most likely with awful form)\n\n**Diet**\n\nAround the same time, I discovered CICO (Calories in : Calories out). I cut my calories to 1000/day. I'd say it worked miracles for my weight loss but it's not a miracle, it's science and discipline - sounds cheesy but if I've learnt anything over these 2 years it's to forget all the pseudo science, fad diets and tips from gym bro's. Nothing works but science and discipline. \n\n \n\n---\n\n# The 2 Years\n\n# [My progress from day 1 to now](https://i.imgur.com/uBxGtSd.jpg). \n\n---\n\n\n# July 2016 (113lbs/51kg) - Sept 2016 (109lbs/49kg)\n\n**Exercise**\n\nMy routine and diet throughout these months are regretful, but it was all a learning experience. Weight loss and aesthetics were my only goals. I designed a body part split based on exercises I had seen recommended on YouTube.\n\nWeekday | Exercise (All done on a 3x12 rep scheme)\n---|---\n**Monday** (Cardio)|  45 mins cycling, 15 minutes stairmaster\n**Tuesday** (Chest, Arms) | DB bench press, Cable flys, bicep curls, hammer curls, tricep extensions\n**Wednesday** (Back, Shoulders) | DB rows, lat pull down, DB lateral raises, machine shoulder press\n**Thursday** (Legs, Chest) | Squat, deadlift, leg press, calf raises\n**Friday** (Arms) | DB bicep curls, DB hammer curls, DB kickbacks, cable tricep extentions \n**Saturday** (Back, Shoulders) | DB rows, Pendlay rows, DB lateral raises, machine shoulder press\n**Sunday** (Rest) | Rest\n\nAlthough I gained strength, there was no planned progression and I certainly missed out on gains and progression because of it. I am an example of why new lifters should use a tried and tested programme, not a self made one. You don't know what you don't know.\n\n\n**Diet** \n\n\nI tried carb cycling and keto. Both of which I deem to be a waste of time. While they do have some scientific backing, and some people find the diets to be effective, I believe they're just complex ways to limit caloric intake, so it all comes down to CICO. \n\nI discovered IIFYM and began tracking macros. I continued my caloric goal of 1000cals/day as that had already given me good results. I set my protein goal at 85g, as I read that you should consume a minimum of .85g of protein per lb of lean body mass.\n\nMacros: 100g carb, 25g fat, 85g protein\n\n---\n\n\n# October 2016 (99lbs/45kg) - February 2017 (123lbs/56kg)\n\n**Exercise** \n\nI started following [nSuns PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/?ref=share&ref_source=link), and my lifts progressed well. \n\nMy working weights progression from start to end:\n\nDeadlift 42.5kg > 53.75kg\n\nSquat 35kg > 43.75kg\n\nBench 27kg > 31.25kg\n\n\n\nWeekday & Session | Exercise (Add 2.5kg to compound lifts each session, acessories 3x12 unless stated otherwise)\n-----|---\nMonday (Pull A) | 3x5 & 1x5+ deadlifts, lat pull down, seated row, 5x20 face pulls, 4x12 hammer curl, 4x12 DB curls, shrugs\nTuesday (Push A) | 4x5 & 1x5+ bench press, OHP, incline DB press, tricep push down superset with 3x15 lateral raise (repeat with tricep extention), 3x15 rear delt fly\nWednesday (Legs) | 2x5 & 1x5+ squat, RDL, leg press, leg curl, 5x12 calf raise\nThursday (Pull B) | 4x5 & 1x5+ row, lat pull down, seated row, 5x12 face pull, 4x12 hammer curl, 4x12 DB curls, shrugs\nFriday (Push B) | 4x5 & 1x5+ OHP, bench pres, incline DB press, tricep push down superset with 3x15 lateral raise (repeat with tricep extention), 3x15 rear delt fly\n\n\n**Diet**\n\nAfter the cut I felt awful; but I thought I looked great. I wanted to be stronger, so I started eating in a surplus. The main increase in calories came from protein in hopes of building more muscle. \n\nMacros: 125 carb / 23 fat / 115 protein\n\n\n# March 2017 (123lbs/56kg) - October 2017 (??kg)\n\nBetween March and May-*ish* I was slowly cutting. I believe I dropped down to \\~54kg but was only loosely tracking weight to keep my focus on strength. This is something I still do, and I believe it's the best way to avoid becoming weight-loss obsessed. From May to October I started a new job and had fallen into the trap of fuck-around-itis. My weight stayed mostly the same, with only minor strength improvements. \n\nMacros: 120 carbs, 22 fat, 110 protein\n\n# November 2017 (??kg) - April 2018 (136lbs/62kg)\n\n**Exercise** \n\nI switched to [nSuns 5/3/1 LP](http://archive.is/2017.01.27-015129/https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5icyza/2_suns531lp_tdee_calculator_and_other_items_all/). The volume and the 1RM sets were a big change, but it was great for powerlifting progression. Each session weight is added to the compound lifts dependant on how many reps are completed in the 1RM set. \n\nWeekday | Compound Lifts (5/3/1 Rep scheme) & Accessories (3x8-12 Rep scheme)\n---|---\nMonday | Bench press, OHP, lat pull down, seated row, face pulls, reverse curls\nTuesday | Squat, sumo deadlift, leg press, leg curl, calf raises \nWesnesday | OHP, incline bench, push ups, lateral raises, upright row\nThursday | Deadlift, front squat, lat pull down, seated row, shrugs, reverse curls\nFriday | Bench press, C.G bench press, machine shoulder press, lateral raise, tricep extention\n\nMy 1RM's: Deadlift - 125kg, Squat - 90kg, Bench - 60kg\n\n\n**Diet**\n\nI started a *go hard-or-go-home-*bulk. Other than protein I did not track calories. My protein goal was 130g per day. I ate intuitively and had a good time. This is when I really started to enjoy powerlifting and getting strong - a liberating change from working out purely for aesthetics. \n\n---\n\n# The Now \n\n[Currently 127lbs/58kg](https://i.imgur.com/pmyL9Jz.jpg)\n\n**Exercise**\n\nMy 1RM's: Deadlift - 132.5kg, Squat - 90kg, Bench - 60kg\n\nI am still following nSuns 5/3/1, and still thoroughly enjoying it. I have maintained most of my strength from the bulk, and set a new deadlift PR. I have also completed Couch to 5k, something I thought I would never enjoy. Right now I think I am the fittest I have ever been. \n\n**Diet**\n\nI have been taking a very relaxed approach to cutting weight in order to maintain my strength. It's amazing how much more I can eat to cut weight when compared to 2 years ago. \n\nMacros: 145 carb, 40 fat, 125 protein\n\nI tend to eat the same thing every day, with the odd untracked treat every now and again. \n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nIt's now clear to me that the key to fitness is science and dedication. All of your goals can be achieved through those two things. However, if you want to live a healthy life, your lifestyle needs to be sustainable. Don't deny yourself food or a social life.  \n\nI know that my physique isn't to everyone's taste (some people are quite vocal) but I am happy and so much more confident in my body. \n\nSo thank you, /r/fitness, for the knowledge and guidance along the way!", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "F/21/5'1 - What 2 years of fitness has taught me", "post_ups": 3592, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8wlkav/f2151_what_2_years_of_fitness_has_taught_me/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:10.323919", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "VMwareJesus", "post_created_utc": 1415376748.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2ll7xc", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 712, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3590, "post_selftext": "I was overly excited to see these posted in his classroom last night.

Well, last week she hit another huge landmark by pulling a solid 350 pound deadlift at a body weight of 140 - 2.5 times her own body weight.\n\n[Here's 315lbs from last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBp7nbfDzp8) \n\n[Here's the 350lbs PR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgvgzLRflc)\n\nI also found this 350 to be significant because it's exactly double what she could deadlift when she first started, which is kind of cool.\n\nAs for her training, we kind of revamped things after she pulled the 315. We adjusted her technique a bit (compare the 315 to the 350: 350 has a more compact stance, a slightly narrower grip, utilization of the stretch reflex, the pull is no longer initiated by \"yanking\" the bar from the floor, etc.) and we got her a real powerlifting belt. We wanted to give her some time to get used to the new technique and break in the belt somewhat/get a feel for it, so we started off the cycle pretty light at 225lbs, which was about 70% of her maximum at the time.\n\nWe ran a basic 5x5 once a week, adding 5 pounds each session. We did this until she got up to somewhere around 265-270 for 5 sets of 5, if I recall correctly. At this point we changed things up a bit. Instead of running a linear progression we switched to more of a \"ramping\" style to increase the intensity. The goal was to work up to a heavy set of 3 each session. After she hit the heaviest triple of the day we would take 30-50lbs off the bar and knock out a few more sets of 3 to accrue some more volume.\n\nWe ran this progression style for the next several months until she pulled 320lbs for a solid set of 3. At this point we decided to test the deadlift with the goal of hitting 350.\n\nDuring this time period she was also squatting twice a week, one heavy and one volume day, as well doing some benching/pullups twice a week after each squat session. She also does some form of cardio 2-3 times a week, but she does that on her own so I don't know too much about it. \n\nAs for where we go from here, I think we will continue to train with the ramping style for a little bit longer and see if she can eek out a bit more progress that way. The short term goal is obviously to get that extra quarter on the bar by pulling 365. I think she can do that if we continue with this cycle. After that we will most likely start all over again with a new training cycle by dropping back down to the 70% range. The goal then will be the big 4 plate landmark. I know she can get there, she just needs a few more years under her belt. But I've always talked about it as an inevitability rather than a possibility and so I'm pretty sure there isn't a doubt in her mind that she will get it soon enough.\n\nAnyway, if you have any questions about her training feel free to ask me!", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "My little sister deadlifted 350lbs at 140 - 2.5 times her own body weight!", "post_ups": 3530, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/32kgsa/my_little_sister_deadlifted_350lbs_at_140_25/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:10.323919", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "stillfat11", "post_created_utc": 1453042673.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1453049999.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "41dtz7", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 557, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3525, "post_selftext": "I lost over 200 pounds in about 2 years.

In my early 20\u2019s I realized that I had a problem and spent four years experimenting with programs, fasting, working out, losing 100 and gaining 75 back.  In April of 2014 I started seeing an eating disorder councilor and that was a world of a difference. She completely changed how I viewed food and my own worth. That was the catalyst to my weight loss and new lease on life. \n\nI started over all at 400+ pounds. I had chest pains, I couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t move and food was a coping mechanism to get through each day. I went a year on fasting at 1000 calories and working out  90 minutes each day. I got to 275 and gave up when I realized it was too hard. I gained back up to 372 and the pains set back in. I was scared and realized my mentality was what was holding me back.

I go 5-6 days a week now and have a trainer.

I had tried everything (or so I thought) but nothing really stuck. Was I the problem or was it the world? I was convinced then that the world was done in such a way that everything delicious made me fat just to spite me. I was also convinced that \"it wasn't that bad\", that \"so many others are way fatter\". Essentially I didn't view myself as \"fat\" but just slightly chubby. I lost girlfriends due to this, as I simply wasn't attractive anymore and I didn't want to change. I was content with sitting in front of the computer monitor all day long and had resigned myself to that form of life. \n\n**The Tipping Points:** \n\nSo what made me change my ways? Well several factors played in. I moved cities after I finished University in 2014 for work and barely knew anyone. This resulted in a lot of alone time in an almost empty 94m^2 apartment in front of the computer. This time was what I had looked forward to in University. No homework and all the cash to do whatever I wanted and build whatever PC I required. \n\nHowever as time went on, I grew bored with the games and the series and the movies. It started feeling like everything was just a loop, that I had seen everything and everything I did was just a repeat of what I had already experienced. Since I was mostly cut-off from the outside world outside of my parents and my co-workers, I had precious little input in my life. As it turns out, even an introvert can get lonely. This spiraled into a mild depression and once I recognized the thought patterns for what they were, I sought out a therapist in the start of 2015. I started spending almost every weekend at my parents house, even though it's a 2 hour drive away, simply to not be lonely, so my parents have been a big support for me in this journey. \n\nI am still unsure whether she actually helped me in the strictest sense, other than maybe by listening to my ramblings about nothing mattering and my total state of apathy. I suppose it helped me in the sense that I suddenly had new input that might help combat the internal feedback loop of spiraling thoughts. But we had also talked about weightloss and I was actually losing a bit of weight, strictly by dieting. I was down almost 20 kg! But it didn't last. Come summer 2015, I started eating like I used to and quickly gained back the lost weight. \n\nSeptember 2015 is where everything crashed. My absolutely lowest point. A few months now I had experienced some sharp abdominal pain every now and again that would last for about an hour after I had eaten a boatload of unhealthy food. I had dismissed it and not really done anything other than to take some heart-burn relief meds, as I figured it might just be that, and since the pains only lasted for about an hour, I didn't question it. However, one Sunday in September 2015, the day before my first business trip around the globe by myself, I had decided that I wanted strawberry ice cream and barbecue bones while watching some series. That of course means the entire liter of ice cream and 1 kg of bones. As I was gorging myself on these treats, I started having these same abdominal pains as before. But this time they just didn't stop. I had to call emergency services. I waited the longest 30 minutes of my life for the ambulance to come. Get to the hospital, still in immense pain, but they wouldn't give me anything for it since they didn't know what it was yet. Cue me being in pain for most of the day until they figured out what was wrong: Gallstones and Acute Pancreatitis. I spent 2 weeks in the hospital, either in immense pain or completely doped in pain killers, only vaguely thinking about the missed business trip that a co-worker had to do instead. \n\nThis visit had brought one good thing though, I hadn't actually eaten much in 2 weeks and my lust for food had dropped considerably in the following weeks. I grabbed this opportunity to start dieting again, but there was still something missing from my life. I hadn't broken out of the hell that was coming back to my empty apartment. So after some searching I found a post on my city's Reddit page, detailing a free running club. I was still overweight though and self-conscious about it, but I think it speaks volumes about my fear of the empty apartment that I actually started showing up. A self-conscious introvert that can barely move without sweating in a running club. \n\nWhether it was the gallstones, the lack of immediate friends or the depression that drove me to change my ways, I still cannot really give an answer. All I know is the combination made me change. \n\n**The Journey**\n\nSo how did I actually lose all the weight? Well it was both diet and exercise. \n\n*The exercise:* \n\nTo accompany the running I had started, I did a lot of walking inside on treadmills with incline on, as well as some strength training with a few friends I had from my online life, that I had only really met a few times before in real life. \n\nI started in the running club, and damn it was embarrassing. First run which was in October, I was joined by one of the founders of the club for what seemed like an eternity for me back then, all of 500m which was all I could run before being completely out of breath. However I stuck with it and it became easier. I could suddenly run 1 km after a few weeks. Suddenly 2 km and even 3 km. In the start of February I ran my first 5k. The thing that kept making me come back was the people though. Suddenly having people to talk to and care about whether you show up or not, really made a huge difference for me. I suddenly didn't feel quite so alone anymore.\n\nI decided to push my pace since I was growing complacent. First I wanted to get under 30 minutes on a 5k. With a bit of luck and some healthy pacing from some lovely runners, I made it and it felt fantastic. I had set a goal and I beat it. Damn I was proud. I kept setting new goals for myself, and I beat my 5k record and came in under 25 minutes with some healthy competition from a fellow runner, pushing each other to do more. \n\nSince pace wasn't an issue anymore, I decided I needed some longer runs. By the 16th of April I had done a 10km run. I didn't think it was possible just 6 months previous but there it was. The running club even made a post about it since I had started from absolutely nothing, and it just felt awesome. 14 days later, on a regular Saturday training with the club, I ran my first half-marathon in 2 hours and 5 minutes. It just felt so good. It really felt like I had found what I was missing from my life in this. \n\nMy dad had always been a runner and had for the past years run a specific half-marathon, so I figured I would join him, it was only the weekend after my first, what harm could it do? Well on the 14th km, my left foot started to hurt. I did finish my first official marathon in 2 hours and 20 min, but I had to walk some of the way. Cue me meeting a physiotherapist some days after, and it was a tendon overload injury. Basically, I had to keep off putting weight on it for 3 weeks and even then I had to start slow again. I was bummed out but it's something every runner has to go through. \n\nSo I started looking around for other things to do in between my runs so I could keep active most days without overloading my tendons. One of the girls from the running club dragged me to spinning one day to try it and I was hooked. I started doing spinning 3 - 4 times a week, even bought my own spinning shoes. I even started swimming regularly in October, also due to being dragged down there. I had been swimming a lot in my younger years, before University. \n\nOnce I was back on top with my tendons fully intact, I ran more than ever. In October I reached over 200 km. My longest run ever was the day before the operation, with 31 km. \n\n*The diet:* \n\nThis one I cannot recommend to most people, as it is simply not healthy. I knew that when I did it but I found something that worked so I stuck with it. I consumed roughly 1200 - 1500 calories a day. This continued well into summer 2016.  \n\nBelow is a usual day: \n\nBreakfast: 250g Skyr with Pear and Banana + \u00bd can of peaches\n\nSnack: Apple / Banana\n\nLunch: 200g Carrots + 100-200g of meat (depending on what the lunch ladies at work at prepared)\n\nSnack: Apple / Banana\n\nDinner: Any low calorie meat like fish or chicken \n\nAfter I was within 5 kg of my goal, I started eating more regular food and increased my calorie intake to 2000 - 2300 and allowing myself some cheat foods like pizza, oreos and gummy bears. \n\n**The Surgery and now**\n\nI had lost 65 kg and I was ready. The surgery happened, paid for by the state due to universal healthcare. They removed 1.7 kg worth of skin, measuring slightly above 2 meters in length. The first two weeks were the worst, although the nice doctors and nurses at the hospital made it just above bearable, they were really nice and encouraging. Going from being active 6 - 7 days a week to not doing anything is not fun, and having to adjust to wearing a compression belt until sometime in February is not really all that great. But I feel fine. I am currently counting the days (28 DAYS!) till I can start doing proper exercise again, as right now I'm only allowed to walk. But with a few audiobooks, some friendly folks from the running club (or my mom!) who offer to take walks with me, I think I can pass the time until I'm allowed to exercise again. \n\n**The Future**\n\nRight now I have a few goals for 2017:\n\n* Copenhagen Marathon 2017\n* 1/4th Ironman sometime in 2017\n* Start proper weightlifting routine \n\n**Pictures**\n\n[Progress Pictures - NSFW!](http://imgur.com/gallery/XdZlI)\n\nStill a bit swollen around the waist from the surgery, but hopefully it'll subside within the next few weeks. \n\n[Tanita Weight stats](http://imgur.com/gallery/2Jn7W)\n\nI wish I had taken more measurements with the Tanita weight during my weight-loss, but for some reason I was too scared to, even though I was losing weight.

They may be more or less appropriate for someone based on their goals, but the overall training effect they provide is very very similar.\n\n2) most people whose squats wind up looking like good mornings need to work on strengthening their quads, most people who have a big gap between the squat and deadlift (larger than 15-20%) need to work on bracing for the squat, and most people without either of the other problems need to strengthen their hip extensors.\n\n3) deep squats are safe for people without pre-existing knee, back, or hip injuries\n\n4) people should squat in a manner in line with their goals. In general, low bar squats are likely best for building hip strength, high bar squats are likely best for building quad strength, and front squats are likely best for building upper back strength, though the head-to-toe training effects are very similar.\n\nThe guide goes into a lot more depth, and seeks to answer most of the common questions people have about squatting.\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "How to Squat: The Definitive Guide \u2022 Strengtheory", "post_ups": 3518, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4ata5a/how_to_squat_the_definitive_guide_strengtheory/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:11.988230", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "", "post_created_utc": 1448769391.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1448776850.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "3uo738", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 509, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3511, "post_selftext": "Hi!\n\nNow to preface this whole ordeal I'd like to point out that by no means am I any competitive powerlifter, but the point of this is less my numbers on the bar and more about the way resistance training have helped me with my illness(es). Ill be pointing to this when friends over at /r/thritis and /r/rheumatism want more info on what I've done.\n \n\n**Pictures first so you don't have to scroll:**\n\n[Before \\(oh my, embarrasing\\)](http://imgur.com/a/lHXNr)\n\n[Now](http://imgur.com/a/rXDZY)\n\n[Now - undies with pathetic attempts at flexing \\(NSFW\\)](http://imgur.com/a/ePN9J)\n\n\n**Backstory:** \n\nIm going to make this as short as possible and if you have more questions about my medical history feel free to ask, Im pretty open about it. Im 29 years old and I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis when I was 16, and ended up in a wheelchair with raging inflammations. \n\nI've since then added to the autoimmune lottery winnings with Ankylosing Spondylitis (aka Bechterews) and Uveitis as well. I suffered rheumatoid cachexia and Ive naturally been struggling with fatigue, pain and depression as symtoms. \n\nLong story short I have been treated like a china doll all through my late teens and adult life due to this, which I've hated. Every movement felt painful. Muscle waste had lead me to being ridiculously weak, not being able to lift a milk packet over my head or get up from sitting position without help or pain. I couldn't walk for more than a few hundred meters at the time, and those were in pain. I was as sedetary as could be, with the exeption of a \"soft approach\" type of physical therapy they tried on me which seemed to just exhaust me further (lots of cardio and swimming). \n\nDuring all these years I struggled with weight. Partially due to the cachexia, the sedetary lifestyle, and depression - but man my diet was awful. I tried fixing this a few times by dieting, and successfully lost weight a few times, but man it piled on quickly again when I stopped going under 1200 kcal. I ballooned up to 85kg/187lbs-ish at my heaviest with a BMI of 33.\n\n\n**The turn around:**\n\nSummer 2 years ago I had an epiphany of sorts, or you could say I hit rock bottom. I realized I was in pain and miserable all the time anyway so why not be in pain with a purpose? \n\nI started dieting, again. But this time instead of just cutting down on calories I made sure (after reading up on Cacexia on my own) to get enough protein in. I started walking, adding a little more distance every day (\"to those trees next time\"), and gradually worked myself up.\n\nI added resistance training when I read up on Ankylosing Spondylitis and saw all the research on the benefits of. I started off with 2lbs dumbbells at home around 2 years ago. Yes, I know everyone laughs at these things but these were heavy to me at the time.\n\nDuring that year (2013-2014) I lost the brunt of my excess weight, and went down from ~85 kgs/187lbs (probably higher, I didnt step on the scale until a few weeks in) to 70kgs/155lbs. I consider this time my \"rehab-year\" as the strength I accumulated here was basically just getting somewhat back to a normal sedetary human bean level.\n\n\n**Starting building some strength:** \n\nI'd always been interested in the barbell and was looking forward to starting with it as I was rehabbing. The gym I had closest to me had no barbells. So I bought my own, and set up shop in my guesthouse. I think I got to around a 155 lbs squat and 180lbs deadlift from May to November 2014.  I really didn't bench any. Slow progress, Im aware, but I was still losing weight and battling everything else.\n\nNovember 2014 I made a decision to join a powerlifting gym. This might have been one of the best decisions Ive ever made. The atmosphere and familiarity was a huge boost, and I've since compteted a couple of times in smaller local meets just for fun. \n\n\n**Lifts progression:**\nI'd like to cut these up in three instances: \n\n1. At start of rehab (mid 2013)\n2. When joining PL Club (late 2014)\n3. Now\n\nSquat: \n\n1. Couldn't get down and up from a chair without help.\n2. 155lbs/ 70 kg with bad pancakeform\n3. [225 lbs / 102.5 kg.](https://www.instagram.com/p/9Q6j0Nobh1/?taken-by=skamnorth) [Also 105 kg but depth is a bit iffy..](https://www.instagram.com/p/9wk2qJobqc/?taken-by=skamnorth)\n\nBench:\n\n1. 2 lbs dumbbell presses\n2. 66 lbs / 30 kg\n3. 127 lbs/ 57.5 kg or [121lbs/55kg x 3.](https://www.instagram.com/p/-ZmpFoobs-/?taken-by=skamnorth) Haven't tried maxing in a while but I suspect lmao1plaet before xmas, which should then also be BW.\n\n\nDeadlift:\n\n1. I remember not being able to lift a four-pack of 1,5l softdrinks.\n2. 176 lbs / 80 kg\n3. [242 lbs/ 110 kg w bad lockout due to grip..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgwI4GQcFiw)\n \n(Sandbagging these, always have, because Im deadly afraid for my back.)\n\n\nBodyweight:\n\n1. ca. 187 lbs/85 kg (obese)\n2. ca 155 lbs/70 kg (overweight)\n3. 134 lbs /61 kg (healthy BMI)\n\nAnd just for good measure...:\n\nHiking (non stop): \n\n1. Maybe 100 painful meters. Used a wheelchair and crutches for when I had to move further. Or just didn't go..\n2. 5-7 km.\n3. 25 km. \n\n**Diet:**\n\nI went down under 1200 kcal for a few months, then upped that to 1400 kcal when I started hiking daily. \nThe last year I've lost weight without counting calories, but Im very active instead, and so Ive lost weight gradually. Having sometimes counted in between just to check, I seem to have a BMR of around 1900-ish now. \nI don't track any other macros than a rough protein estimate, trying to hit over 80gr a day minimum. \n\nI don't eat pork because that seem to trigger my inflammations more. I eat a lot of veggies because they're yummy. As a typical islander I eat a shitton of fish. I will eventually try to get stricter with my diet to lose a little more fluff for vanity and the sports sake (going down a weight class).\n\nIm not experiencing any excess skin. Some stretchmarks, but other than that Im good.\n\n**How have this all affected me outside of fitness?**\n\n* I dont use painkillers on the daily anymore. I used to not be able to go through the day without them, even though I've always hated how they make me feel. This is one of the greatest benefits of all.\n* I feel confident. I even feel pretty occasionally! And damn, feeling strong is amazing. Especially when you know what its like having felt so very weak.\n* I'm able to work at a higher % than I used to be.\n* I'm limber. \n* I sleep better.\n* Im all around happier. I feel like I can handle things better. The only things that have given me a bit of a tumble have been life events that would give anyone a bit of a tumble. Im functioning quite well and Im actually looking forward to the future.\n\n**And what now? Im gonna keep lifting. Im gonna keep a high protein diet. I wanna get good enough to compete at least on a national level (in Norway) even if I might not reach the top 3.**\n\nAnd Im gonna keep preaching the combo of protein and lifting to other people in my position. I dont expect this to work for everyone, nor am I so arrogant as to think Im not lucky for this having worked for me. \n\nBut if you were like me, and in pain and miserable without any hope for the future, try!\nMy rheumathologist even told me to \"keep up whatever it is you are doing\"! So yes, yes I will. \n\nEdit: Added some videos of lifts (no vid no did and all that jazz)", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "F/29/5'2 - From Wheelchair to Powerlifting Progress and ~45lbs lost.", "post_ups": 3511, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3uo738/f2952_from_wheelchair_to_powerlifting_progress/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:11.988230", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Arnold_LiftaBurger", "post_created_utc": 1406657412.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1406685855.0, "post_gilded": 2, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 2, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2c2atq", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 871, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3504, "post_selftext": "Knee and wrist injury keeping me from deadlifting.

After regaining 12 lbs, in January I decided it was time to cut again. [Those pictures are here.](https://imgur.com/gallery/FPuPp)\n\nFor this cut I decided not to use keto again, despite having great results with it last year. I made this decision mostly out of convenience, as my job requires me to be away all day and I often eat dinner in my car, so keeping meat or eggs in my car all day was not an option for me. I tracked calories meticulously and used a 2pm-8pm eating window (intermittent fasting) which I had great success with in the past. A day of eating would usually consist of 2 meals at about 1000 calories per meal. An example:\n\nMeal 1:\n\n2 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches\n\na banana or two\n\na Clif energy bar or oats\n\nMeal 2:\n\nChicken and veggies (sometimes on tacos, sometimes not)\n\n2 servings of protein powder\n\n8 oz skim milk\n\nThis usually would give me around 1900-2100 calories, with roughly 160-170g of protein.\n\nAs for training, I followed [Wendler's 5/3/1 BBB variation](https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101077382-boring-but-big). In December (before the cut) my lifts at a mock powerlifting meet were 375lb squat/205lb bench (kind of a fluke, though)/455 deadlift. I'd love to give you my list of excuses why my bench was so terrible, but I'll spare you and just say that in the gym I've hit a 240lb bench.\n\nMy strength over the past year hasn't increased much, and that's due a lot to me dedicating a lot of energy into bouldering, which is a hobby I picked up shortly after my diet last year. Those sessions can leave my shoulders and back pretty tired, and my strength training has somewhat suffered from this, but I don't mind too much as I've become pretty happy with where my strength is at.

I consists 4 short exercises and 1 stretch and you can easily do it in the sitting position after your work. It will promote bloodflow into your forearm muscles, your finger tendons, stretch your finger flexors and make you feel good. It takes only five minutes of your time and you can just follow-along with the video, if you like.\n\nIf you don't like to watch **[the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6y0D_8kRoU)**, i have the exercises written down with pictures for you here:\n\n* After a long day at the computer, start by shaking your hands a little bit. It will loosen up the tightness in the fingers and make them feel good.\n\n* [Start by closing and opening your hands in an explosive fashion.](http://imgur.com/ciUsayl) Focus on really closing the fist with your muscles and opening them quickly. Do this for about 30 seconds.\n\n* Second Exercise: Now keep the fingers tight to each other and close the hand in two steps: [With straight, extended fingers, bend at the MCP joint, then bend the PIP joint next.](http://imgur.com/CNl0qWB) Now open your hand explosively and repeat. Do this for about 30 seconds.\n\n* [Next exercise is closing and opening your fingers at the DIP joint (which is the last joint before the fingertips).](http://imgur.com/4vK9BP5)\n\n* Shake your hands again for a bit, like at the start of the routine.\n\n* Next exercise are the \"Walking Extensors\". Take the ending position from the Second Exercise and extend the Index Finger. Now while closing the index finger, extend the middle finger. Close the middle finger and extend ring and pinky finger. Go back to the middle finger. And back to the index finger. Repeat for about 30 seconds! [Example picture here.](http://imgur.com/eFgvqcb) If you can, go really fast at this one and increase the speed.\n\n* End the routine with a flexor stretch of your fingers.

My low was 150 lbs. \n\nI have been in the \"Normal\" weight range on the BMI scale for over a year at this point, fluctuating between 155-160 lbs. My weight has remained stable in this range.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSome before shots:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/I6Np4\n\nBefore/After side-by-side:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/UJRNqAm\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt took me about a year to a year and a half to lose the weight. I did not keep any logs or precise dates, for which I must apologize.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI lost the weight without adding any additional exercise. In fact, I suffered from a deep depression shortly after those 'Before' fishing pics and barely left the house except to walk to my daughter's bus stop. (Which I had been doing for 2 years already while I was obese) I was so down and out that I would sit on the sidewalk like a lump waiting for my daughter's bus, until one day a man offered me food because he thought I was homeless. That left a deep impression. (Thank you anonymous stranger guy for caring about your fellow human being)\n\n\nI lost this weight by completely overhauling my eating habits.\n\n\nWhen I first made the decision to go for it, I began by strictly limiting my calories. \n\n\nTypical day at the beginning of my weight loss was:\n\n\n**Breakfast**: 3 cups of coffee with 1/2 & 1/2 and Sucralose for breakfast.\n\n**Lunch**: 2 Pieces of Whole Grain Toast with Margarine & No Sugar Added Jelly for lunch, or a serving of Old Fashioned Oats with Margarine, Sucralose, and Cinnamon.\n\n**Dinner**: 3/4 of a plate Steam Bag Veggies/Brown Rice/Potatoes, 1/4 plate meat. (I also switched to smaller 8\" plates) Some nights Pasta with Marinara.\n\n**Dessert**: No Sugar Added Canned Fruit.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter I lost a significant amount of weight, I added Oatmeal or Whole Grain Toast w/ Margarine & Jelly to my coffee & cream for Breakfast.\n\n\nYes, this sounds drastic, and it was, but I knew that I was able to draw hundreds of calories per day from my highly excessive fat stores. Also, I was getting around 300-400 calories from the coffees with 1/2 & 1/2 in the morning.\n\n\nI was taking Vitamin D3, B12, Calcium to prevent deficiencies and Grapeseed Extract to help prevent my massive fat stores from aromatizing too much of my Testosterone into Estrogen and hampering my progress. \n\n\nAt the beginning I was very strict with myself. Once I saw the progress, I would allow myself to have sandwiches and other higher calorie items for Breakfast or Lunch. Though, I still relied heavily on butter toast with jelly and oatmeal.\n\n\nAlso, throughout this time I would go out to eat at a restaurant once on the weekend with my family. When I did so, I would try to order healthy items instead of ordering meat heavy or deep fried dishes like I had before. I have no real way to account for the calories of these meals, I didn't really consider them a 'cheat meal' I was just going out with my family to enjoy their company and have a meal.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOnce I fell below 250 lbs., the number I'd not been able to break for many years, I began to allow myself a wider variety of foods, but I still kept all of the major changes that I made in how I ate.\n\n\nOh, and I almost forgot to add, I cut my alcohol consumption completely for the first part of my weight loss, and only allowed myself to drink occasionally after that.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOnce I got to 150 lbs. I was shocked at how little muscle I had. That is when I decided to add exercise.\n\nI started with lifting a milk jug of water (~8 lbs.) every day. When I noticed how good I felt, I made it the first thing I did every morning. When the milk jug felt like nothing, I went out and bought a 20 lb. weight. That 20 lb. weight is better than any coffee I've ever had. I go from drowsy to wide awake with that thing. I still do 20 reps on each arm every morning with it.\n\n\nI then added push ups, something I had never been able to do properly in my entire life. At first I could not do a proper push up at all. I felt like a weakling. I progressed to doing 2 sets of 15 push ups every day.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen I was a teenager I dislocated my shoulder and it required surgery with metal pins and over a month of recovery plus rehabilitation. My doctor said that I could no longer play football, that I could not do pull ups and many other things. He said that I have a 95% chance of dislocating it if I fell on it again. I wanted to destroy this barrier so badly. I started doing Ring Rows and Dumbbell Rows.\n\n\nJust a few weeks back I did my first ever standing chin up. It felt AMAZING! I quickly progressed and I now do a mix of pull ups and chin ups every night before bed. The most I have done at this point is 10 in one session. I let myself down slowly to a hang, but I do sadly feel a weakness and discomfort in my damaged shoulder, so I probably have a way to go before I am busting out dead hang pull ups or chin ups.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA normal day now looks something like this for me:\n\n**Breakfast:** 2-3 cups of coffee w/ 1/2 & 1/2, 2 servings of Old Fashioned Oats with 2 TBSP of Vital Wheat Gluten, Vanilla Almond Milk, & Sucralose.\n\n**Lunch:** Salted Pita Chips Made with Canola Spray, a Bowl of Cottage Cheese & Sour Cream for dipping.\n\n**Snack:** 1-2 Cheese Quesadillas\n\n**Dinner:** Pasta w/ Sauce or Giant Baked Potato with Cheese, Green Onions, & Sour Cream or Grilled Fish w/ Loads of Veggies or a homemade Hamburger or something similar \n\n**Dessert:** Heaping plate of Watermelon or smaller portions of other fruits (I still love the no Sugar Added Canned Fruit\n\n\nI also add servings of Eggs, Cottage Cheese, or an extra quesadilla or something depending on how my weight and exercise performance is doing.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI now exercise every day. I have found that one of my biggest downfalls was a drowsy feeling that I often used to get. If I feel that coming on, I go do some quick exercise to alleviate that and I feel alert & positive after doing so.\n\n\nI have written a blog that goes into more details about some of the changes I made, but I don't know if that is allowed here, so I did not add a link to it.\n\nOh, and a few months ago I also got rid of my chair and I now have a DIY standing desk. This was a big help for keeping me feeling alert throughout the day.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you are in a place in your life somewhat similar to where I was in mine in the before pictures, I just want you to know that you can do it. It is all up to you, but you most certainly can do it. Don't let anyone talk you out of it or make you feel bad about it because the other side of this journey feels SO MUCH BETTER than the beginning of it.\n\n\nThank you for reading my story!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nedit: Holy Paragraphs, Batman! What have I done? It's all jumbled together. I tried adding some double spaces, but I can't seem to make them stick. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Ahh... Much better. I just had to bust out my non-breaking space fu.*\n\nEdit 7/21: Wow!! Thank you so much for all of your support and for sharing your progress and struggles! It really means a lot to me. Looks like I have a lot of reading to do this evening! :0) \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Edit:** Someone asked me about protein shakes, and I forgot to mention them in my post.\n\nAfter I lost some of the initial weight, I used Vanilla Protein Shakes w/ Almond Milk & Added Fiber as a meal substitute for breakfast or lunch. I usually used Soy Protein, but I sometimes used Whey. \n\nWhat I found was that after my first phase of heavy calorie restriction, I would sometimes find myself not wanting to eat solid food for breakfast or lunch. So I would have a 16 oz. Protein Shake. These cold shakes with fiber did an excellent job of filling me up & soothing my hunger pangs.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "I went from Morbidly Obese to \"Normal\" BMI - Total Loss of 175 lbs.", "post_ups": 3483, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3dzcab/i_went_from_morbidly_obese_to_normal_bmi_total/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:11.988230", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Ghostlakes", "post_created_utc": 1414155051.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2k6wt2", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 602, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3471, "post_selftext": "Hi everyone! For background, I'm 19 and am in a position where I'm completely reliant on the food in my dining hall. After going through childhood obese and reaching a highest weight of around 242lbs, I made the decision to do something about it. I was told to post here with the goal of helping to motivate anyone who may be in a similar situation and thinks that it cannot be done. After 8 months of hard work, I've reached my first goal weight of 160lbs. I personally followed a ketogenic diet, but other plans can be followed as well if you know what you're doing. I'm going to outline my process along with any tips that I can think of that helped me to succeed.\n\n**Food**: \nI pretty much lived at the salad bar, which was filled with trays of lettuce, raw spinach leaves, and other vegetables. I'd load up on all of the green things I could find and then used my own salad dressing that I kept in my dorm fridge. The dressings at my school have a lot of added sugar, so keeping my own has helped me avoid excess carbs and sugar. For breakfast, I'll have an omelette with coffee and cream. Just be careful and check with dining services that pancake batter/fillers aren't added to your eggs, since it's fairly common (especially if you have Sodexo!). If you're not on keto but still trying to cut calories or follow paleo, stick to the salad bar and don't be afraid to ask the chefs to accommodate you! This can be done at dining services, disability services, or even just through being nice and talking to the chefs! I've seen them make special egg white omelets for people who ask nicely. Also, protein is the most difficult thing to come by, at least at my school. All of the meats tend to be doused in high-calorie sauces or breaded, so I stick to plain grilled chicken, tuna (at the salad bar), and the occasional bunless burger (my school doesn't use fillers in them). For drinks, I stuck to water, green tea, and coffee. Water is the best and easiest to come by, since there are fill-up stations everywhere. I also take a multivitamin, since I can't be sure I'm getting everything I need without the ability to track my intake accurately.\n\n**Exercise**: \nI didn't really have a regular exercise routine, but I wish I did. I recently began swimming and plan on lifting, but it wasn't part of the biggest phase of my weight loss. If you're at a college, you probably have access to a free or low-cost gym, so make use of it! My school has free classes, running clubs, and a ton of exercise-themed events. You'll maintain a healthy metabolism and prevent muscle loss. \n\n**PICS**: http://imgur.com/a/B7bR0\n\nI think that's about it!

What do you think?  [Take a survey!](http://goo.gl/forms/UsRNCERpiM)**\n\nIt was a balmy Cinco de Mayo two years ago and I was a few margaritas deep on my deck when the admins popped the question: \"Would you be interested in becoming a default sub?\"  We can blame the alcohol but I still think becoming a default sub was a neat opportunity for /r/Fitness.  At the time, we discussed the risks but ultimately the mod team decided that getting the wiki at the fingertips of more people and putting /r/Fitness' tough love in front of a wider audience would ultimately do more good and help more people reach their fitness goals.  \n\nI do think a lot of good things came out of us becoming a default sub, but after two years us mods are kinda over it.  And the stick nudging us over that edge is our attitude and approach to /r/all.  \n\nFor those unaware, when a post in /r/Fitness reaches the top 100 of /r/all it is automatically locked.  (It should be noted this was the case long before we were a default.)  It was clear then - and even more clear now - that when our posts reach /r/all they take a sharp and rapid nose dive right into the shitter.  It's terrible.  Most people don't actually get that though, because the mods do work to keep the trash comments removed as the posts become more popular.  But if a woman's progress post blows up... [sweet jesus](https://imgur.com/a/Da60T) [the kind of comments](https://imgur.com/a/ZqbXO) that start rolling in...   /r/Fitness has always been better than that, and it sucks that the masses get to derail our best and brightest.  \n\nFurthermore, take a look at [our modlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/about/moderators).  It's short and of the 11 there, one is just the CSS guy, two are bots, and two are absentee.  So we are effectively modding this sub with 6 people.  You're not going to find many defaults with that small of a list of active mods.  But we like it that way, which is why the obvious solution of adding more mods to deal with the onslaught of /r/all debauchery is not something we are considering.  Especially after our recent call for new moderators received a lukewarm reception. \n\nSo we just lock things down.  And while it helps keep the riff raff at bay and our work load down, it sucks for *our community*.  There is an option for subs to opt out of /r/all, but it's not one available to default subreddits.  **In an effort to stop killing threads to the detriment of /r/Fitness users, the mod team feels it's worth the loss of the default status to gain the ability to opt out of /r/all.**  \n\nAnd quite frankly, going back to being a sub where people have to find us (not that it's hard) instead of everyone just wandering through sounds really damn nice.  And I think it will help us [get to know ourselves better as a community again.](http://i.imgur.com/utEgUAZ.gif)  \n\nBut before doing so, we wanted to put this question to the community to get your feedback and hear your thoughts.  **Do you think we should remain a default or not?  Does the idea of opting out of /r/all appeal to you?  Do you have any a solution perhaps we have not thought of?**  \n\nWe've got a very simple poll here for people too if they'd rather not comment and just click something.  \n\nhttp://goo.gl/forms/UsRNCERpiM\n\nThanks, Fittit.

Although I played sports and was fairly active my eating habits were below average. A big insecurity of mine was my \"man boobs\" and although I had grown use to accepting them it wasn't until this summer I found motivation to change. I started working out maybe twice a week. Once I found motivation in lifting weights I found diets that could help me lose unnecessary fat. I learned about the atkins diet and stayed to low carb meals for about a month and lost twenty pounds. I was high on life at the idea of losing so much weight in so little time. After ending the low carb dieting I had a habit of eating healthy and working out which was perfect for me to start my school year in September. Over the next few months I worked out twice a day for 6 days a week. (cardio in the morning, weights in the evening). \n\nAtkins diet:\nFor those that haven't heard of the atkins diet it is a low carb diet and high in protein and good fats. \nHere is an example of how my day would look. \n\nBreakfast:\n3 Egg whites\n2 slices Turkey Bacon\nGlass of Water\n\nLunch: \nCup of Spinach with assorted vegetables and balsamic vinegar\nGrilled Chicken Breast\n\nDinner: \nGround beef patty\nCup of broccoli\ncup of carrots\n\nObviously this changed from day to day but you get the idea.\n\nExercise: \nI started off by doing something similar to this.

It\u2019s the beginning of September, my now ex-wife asked me for a divorce while I was running for political office, was stuck in a rut at work, and everything felt like a chaotic mess. The walls were closing in, my future was over, etc. There were a couple of really dark weeks at this point. Suicide was legitimately considered and \u201cplanned\u201d. Didn\u2019t leave the apartment for a couple of days.\n\nThen something happened. I really can\u2019t say what it was, but I decided to just...do some stuff I had planned on doing for awhile. I cleaned the apartment, tried to constructively reach out to my ex (didn\u2019t work, but amenable divorce was finalized in February), and actually got a promotion at work. But relevant to this post, I decided to fix my diet and start doing CrossFit. I actually went from 290 to 210 about 5 years ago, but I did absolutely no exercise, hit the low point weight but still looked fat. Was super discouraging, ended up meeting my ex around this time, and just got lazy. My ex was also on the larger side, and we just settled into a routine of buffets, movies and inactivity. This time was going to be different.\n\nI had been reading various health related subreddits ( /r/loseit /r/fitness /r/crossfit etc) for a bit and had gleaned some \u201crules\u201d. 1) Eat less to lose weight, exercise to be awesome. Not looking better was super discouraging those few years ago. 2) No food is off-limits, it\u2019s all calories in/calories out. Managing Keto for me back then was a nightmare. I can\u2019t stand food prepping. etc. 3) Don\u2019t keep junk food in the house. If I really want ice cream, I have to put on pants and drive to get it. This was another struggle back when I first lost the weight. 4) You can only do so much damage in a day. 4000-5000 calorie binges derailed me the first time around, and they existed early on this time around too. Just realizing that I could just get back on the wagon and barely have taken a step backwards was huge.\n\nThere was plenty of other tidbits and mantras that did and continue to keep me going, but these were the big ones. Now for the specifics:  \n\nAs number 2 says, I downloaded MyFitnessPal and started logging. I set a calorie daily goal of 1500 a day, no routine cheat days (if they happened, fine, but it was because of un preventable circumstances, not something I depended on), and did not factor in exercise. An example day of eating would be nothing for breakfast (never been a breakfast guy, so I intermittent fasted for most of the last 6 months), a Lean Cuisine (350ish), a Yogurt cup (100ish), a pack of Starkist flavored tuna (100ish) and a banana for lunch (650ish calories), a chicken breast and very large serving of veggies (usually mushrooms or spinach) for dinner (600-700ish calories), and a protein shake mixed in somewhere depending on when I did my workout (300ish calories).  \n\nI am now sponsored by a company here locally that does chef prepared, never frozen, calorie and nutrient controlled meals. The meals are delivered to my gym Mondays and Thursdays. I eat around 600 calories for lunch and 600 calories for dinner, then supplement another 200-400 calories with things like protein shakes and bars. Meals can range from herb roasted chicken and a baked sweet potato to bison chili with braised greens as a side. Currently on the Paleo meal plan. Yes, they\u2019re a sponsor, but they\u2019ve GREATLY simplified my food life, I never have to cook anymore, and I\u2019m eating foods I\u2019d NEVER cook on my own. If you can afford it and have a quality local company, I\u2019d definitely recommend signing up for a fresh meal prep service.\n\nAs for fitness, I initially started with 3 CrossFit classes a week, M/W/F, with all other days being pure rest days. I was super interested in CrossFit because it seemed like the perfect weightloss routine, covered my programming and got cardio in (which I\u2019ve hated since HS football) while primarily being weight lifting (which I love). I read all the horror stories, watched all the YouTube fail videos, and listened to all the advice to just hit a gym and lift. But I also heard from friends that had done CrossFit with a solid, knowledgeable coach. So I went out and found one. Tried several gyms, probably close to 10 around me, before finding the one I\u2019ve been using since. My coach has a couple of degrees, almost every CrossFit certification, and has been doing it for a long time. My first day, he told me to put the bar down during Front Squats after watching me and said, \u201cWe won\u2019t be touching that again for awhile, that going to be okay with you?\u201d Knew I found a good place.\n\nSince then, I ramped up to 5 days a week after a month filled with DOMS, to 6 days a week attending Sunday\u2019s Olympic Weightlifting class with Saturday as a rest day, to where I am now, training 10-12 times a week. Current routine is an intense cardio routine in the morning at 5AM (training for a marathon, so usually at least 5K distance pushing for faster mile times. Have a marathon training program I\u2019m following). When I hit goal weight, this cardio will scale back and involve weight lifting once I\u2019m in a calorie surplus. Then, after work, I go to CrossFit at 5:30PM and complete the day\u2019s programming. This is M-F. Saturday is still a true rest day unless I have a 5K/10K or a CrossFit competition, then Sunday becomes the rest day. If I don\u2019t have any of those, Sunday is Olympic Weightlifting training.  \n\nStarting Fitness Stats:  \nMax Back Squat - Struggled with body weight (old football injury complicates this), Deadlift - 175lbs, Benchpress - 85lbs  \nToday Fitness Stats: Back Squat - 255lbs, Deadlift - 375lbs, Benchpress - 215lbs\n\nI know this has gotten super long, so I\u2019ll wrap up here and answer anything I missed in the comments. I love talking about my journey and I\u2019m considering going into personal training once I hit goal weight, not sure on that end yet. Been using my social media feeds to chronicle my journey and hopefully inspire others. Not sure if I can post them, will edit them into here if someone says it\u2019s okay. Long term plans are potentially personal training, competitive powerlifting and competitive CrossFit. Since I started in September, I\u2019ve competed in 3 CrossFit competitions, completed my first ever 5K, my first ever 10K with a sub-hour time, and my life has radically changed for the better. I know I saved myself from an early grave, and I\u2019m going to try to make the most out of this extra time.  \n\nThanks for taking the time to read all of this if you\u2019re still here.

I started my fitness journey like many other teens my age. My girlfriend and I had just broken up and I noticed how uncomfortable I felt in my body without having the crutch of a significant other (she always told me I looked good, which was nice of her). However, I had been self-conscious my entire life and I was sick of it. I lacked a lot of muscle, and anything that looked like muscle was really just fat in the right places. I spent any free time I had playing xbox. Modern Warfare 2 was my life back then. \n\nIt was a slow process getting into the hang of things and learning my way around the gym. I asked a lot of questions and did a ton of research from the get-go, but since there was SO MUCH information out there I often couldn't stay consistent. \n\nTime flew by and eventually I had hit my two and a half year mark of lifting. I looked \"alright\" but nothing like I thought I would look after hitting the gym hard almost every day. I couldn't quite wrap my head around things since all my friends were making better progress than me. That's when the word DIET came into play. \n\nEven though I had been going to the gym and doing all sorts of lifting routines, I was still drinking on the weekends and eating my bodyweight in Jack-in-the-Box tacos. My diet was absolutely terrible. \n\nI started slow with the diet process again and eventually learned what macros were and that carbohydrates had nothing to do with carbonation in soda (seriously, I thought that). My favorite dieting technique that helped the most was carb-cycling. I liked the fact that I could have a day with a lot of carbs and still continue to see results. \n\nFast forward to today. I am now a Bodybuilding.com employee and clothing model. I have come A LONG way since my beginning and have changed my body composition through DIET, TRAINING, and necessary SUPPLEMENTATION (whey, multi vitamin, creatine, bcaa).\n\nI never jumped on the pro-hormone or steroid bandwagon due to me already being a hypochondriac, and messing with something like that would probably be the end of me. (No offense to anyone who has taken that path).\n\nI am now 24 years old. I am 4.5% bodyfat (7-point pinch test) at 192 lbs, and 6'1 feet tall. \n\nI started at around 21% (7-point pinch test) bodyfat at 185 lbs, 6'1.\n\nMy name is Anthony Fisher\n\nProof!\n\nhttp://www.bodybuilding.com/store/bodybuildingcom-clothing/core-vertical-contrast-stringer-tank.html \n\nEdit* Added a couple more upper body shots and a leg shot. \n\nEdit two*\n\nIf I could give you guys the perfect diet plan and training routine, by all means I would! However, it took me years of trial and error to find what would work for me personally. Everyone is different and learning the hard way is actually the best way to learn! Knowing your body is key! Taking the time to research different diets that work best for your lifestyle and that are feasible are going to be your best bet! As cliche as this sounds, I did all my research from when I was 19, until now on bodybuilding.com. The idea is to group similar information and stick with it! It's all about being consistent. Nobody get's anywhere doing fad diets. \n\nYou want to lose fat? Then stick with losing fat. You want muscle? Than focus on building muscle. Doing both at the same time can be difficult for a newbie, but not impossible with enough education. If I could do it all over again I wouldn't change a thing. I'm glad it took me a while because it gave me something to chase. And you know what? I still haven't caught it. With that said, here is a general idea of what I eat everyday to stay lean!\n\nBreakfast! (shake)\n\n1 Cup oats,\n1 Cup Spinach,\n1 Scoop whey isolate, \n1/2 Cup of blueberries, \n2 Cups of 30 cal almond milk\n\nSnack!\n\n1 Cookie Dough Quest Bar (heaven in a wrapper), \n1 Whole wheat bagel,\n1 tbs of low sugar jelly,\n1 Cup of coffee :)))\n\nLunch!\n\n1 Cup brown rice, \n1 cup Brocoli, \n4 oz chicken, \n1 tbs olive oil, \n\nSnack\n\n3 rice cakes,\n1 scoop whey isolate, \n\nDinner!\n\n2 High fiber tortillas,\n6 oz chicken, \n1 cup spinach, \nSalsa to taste, \n\nBedtime snack!\n\n1 cup cottage cheese,\n1 tbs low sugar jelly,\n15 toasted coconut almonds :)\n\nAs far as training goes, I stick with the same routine/plan for about 1-2 months and then drastically change it! \n\nSunday - Chest/triceps \n\nMonday - Back/legs \n\nTuesday - 30 min of HIIT cardio (only cardio I do)\n\nWednesday - Arms/Abs\n\nThursday - Shoulders/Abs\n\nFriday - Legs \n\nSaturday - Video games \n\nHopefully that helps some of you guys! Also, I'm not famous, just an average dude who got an awesome opportunity. The closest thing I have to answering any questions after this is Instagram. \"anthonyyfisherr\"\n\nP.S.

Taken exactly 3 years apart to the day.\n\nLink to an [album of all of my progress pics](https://imgur.com/a/lMyhFQc)\n\nAlso, some numbers.\n\n |Lifting Start| Current\n---|---|----|---\nWeight | 135lbs | 165lbs\nSquat | 115x1 | 390x3\nBench | 75x1 | 265x3 (touch and go)\nDeadlift | 95x5 | 425x3 (sumo with straps)\n\nThese are my first lifting numbers but I started my fitness journey at 128lbs.\n\nExactly 3 years ago today, on January 13th 2016 I was browsing r/all and stumbled upon this subreddit. It was a progress post by a redditor that went from very thin to looking like a Greek god. I remember actually looking at myself and for the first time realizing just exactly how skinny I was and that I wanted to change. I took my first ever [progress picture](https://i.imgur.com/uqLFKhp.jpg), read the sidebar, and started the r/bodyweightfitness **recommended routine** that same day.\n\n#Timeline:\n\n###The First Few Months -\nI paid attention to how much I was really eating and noticed it was barely anything. That mixed in with playing soccer/running everyday was not helping. I stepped on a scale, wrote down my starting weight of 128lbs and ate some food. When I started, I was too nervous to go to an actual gym because I didn't know what I was doing and thought that I would constantly embarrass myself/be made fun of for being weak (I was very wrong). So I started with r/bodyweightfitness\u2019 **recommended routine** because I could do it from home. Seriously a really good routine and I still occasionally do it when I am away from the gym for awhile and looking for a workout. (Still can\u2019t hold a handstand though not from lack of trying haha)\n\nI definitely got stronger during this time but could not find any of my workout logs.\n\n###April - Mid June 2016 -\nAround the beginning of April, my buddy and I joined a local gym and started up with **Stronglifts 5x5**.   \nStarted out at the gym weighing 135 lifting just the bar to work on form as **Stronglifts** recommends. \n\nI had tested my limits a bit with a trainer and found that my starting 1 rms were - \n\n\nSquat |115lbs\n---|---\nBench | 75lbs\n\nI did not attempt for deadlift.\n\n \nI followed stronglifts until mid June and ended had made some [noticeable gains](https://i.imgur.com/NgrPWoS.jpg). (Not sure why the photo is so low res sorry)\n\n\nWeight | 152lbs \n---|---\nSquat | 5x5 165lbs\nBench | 5x5 135lbs\nDeadlift | 1x5 225lbs (Not great form)\n\n\nAround this time life got in the way, I didn\u2019t lift weights again until mid October my senior year of highschool. I did however try and do the recommended bodyweight routine every now and then but wasn\u2019t consistent.\n\n###Mid October 2016 -\nI started up with **Stronglifts** again because it was familiar.\nMy numbers were\n\n\nWeight | 145lbs\n---|---\n Squat| 5x5 135lbs\nBench | 5x5 105lbs\nDeadlift| 1x5 155lbs\n\n[Progress Pic](https://i.imgur.com/M4VqAp6.jpg)\n\nI stayed on **Stronglifts** wayyyy longer than I should have or that it\u2019s intended for but I liked it and it was quick and easy and I could do it in my school\u2019s weightroom before going home. \n\n###April - October 2017 -\nI switched over to the P.H.U.L routine listed in the sidebar and ran that all summer. I really liked P.H.U.L and made some pretty nice progress while running the program. Starting college, I added in another upper body day into the routine and ran that through the end of the year.

There have been days where all I would have to eat was a piece of toast and some butter. Diet has always been the hardest part for me as I really enjoy exercise and lifting heavy things. Weight gain has been fairly slow for me because of that and I have to be really on top of things to add the weight. Because of that I\u2019ve never really done a true cut or bulk cycle and have been slow bulking for most of the past three years. I never have really kept track of my macros before besides trying to eat a lot of protein. Because I eat at my university\u2019s cafeterias in addition to cooking myself, it\u2019s a little harder to track to be 100% accurate so I set ranges that I try and fall into. \n  \nMy current macro targets are as follows.\nI try and eat between 3700 - 4000 calories a day and shoot for at least 0.8gs of protein per lb. of lean body mass. I often end up eating more protein than is necessary. I also look for more complex carbs and have more carbs than fats. My diet isn\u2019t perfect but it works for me.\n\nA typical day looks like this \u2013 \n\n###**Meal 1: Burrito Bowl \u2013 70g protein 1676cal**\n\n+ 4 servings of Rice 120x4=480 9g P\n\n+ 1.25 servings of chicken \u2013 150 + 50=200\n23g\n\n+ 1 serving Refried \u2013 140\n5g\n\n+ 1 Serving of Black bean \u2013 120\n4g\n\n+ 1 serving queso \u2013 320\n14g\n\n+ Cheese- 110\n7g\n\n+ 1 serving guac - 150\nProtein 4g\n\n+ Tortilla \u2013 156 \nProtein 4g\n\n+ Gatorade (16oz) \u2013 142.5\n\n**Total Meal Calories 1818.5**\n\n###**Meal 2: Protein Packed Rice Bowl - Protein- 40g Calories - 935**\n\n+ Spinach \u2013 40 \n4g protein\n\n+ Hard boiled eggs \u2013 108\n\n+ Chicken -  150\n\n+ Bacon \u2013 37x2 maybe\n\n+ Black bean -120\n\n+ Rice 2 scoops \u2013 480\n\n+ Gatorade (16oz) \u2013 142.5\n\n**Meal Calories 1077.5**\n\n\n###**Cliff Protein Bar (Mint Chocolate Flavor)** \u2013 Protein -20g Calories 270\n\n###**Meal 3: Eggs and Toast \u2013 Protein - 40g 740cal**\n+ 3 Eggs -240cal\nProtein -21g\n\n+ 2 Slices of toast -140cal\nProtein -5g\n\n+ 2 servings of peanut butter- 360cal\nProtein -14g \n\n###**Daily caloric Intake = 3906cal**\n\n###**Daily Protein Intake = 170g**\n\n\n#**Current Nsuns workout \u2013** \nCurrently running accessories based off of a suggested set I found on r/nsuns. It's targeting arms a good amount and I have weaker arms/always wanted bigger arms. I will probably switch my accessories up pretty soon.\n\n###**Day 1 \u2013 Bench and Overhead Press**\n\nSame as the program. Lots of Sets.\n\n**Accessories -** \nIncline Dumbbell Press 4x8-12,\nSeated Cable Row 4x8-12,\nSuper Set Pull Ups 4x8-12 and Tricep Cable Push Down 4x8-12, 21s Bicep Curls (Love this one).\n\n \n\n###**Day 2 \u2013 Squat and Paused rep Sumo Deadlift**\n\nLike most sumo pullers I am weakest off of the ground so I have incorporated pulling paused rep to help with that. I hate them though lol.\n\n**Accessories -**\nLeg Press 4x8-12, Leg Extensions 4x12 (I go light on these), and Core (Usually ab roller and planks. Sometimes hanging leg raises.)\n\n###**Day 3 \u2013 Paused Rep Bench and Overhead Press**\nI switched from OHP being the main lift to paused rep bench purely because I am trying to get my bench up more for competition.\n\n**Accessories -**\nIncline Dumbbell Press 4x8-12 (sometimes), Cable Crossovers 4x12, Superset Facepulls 4x12-15 and Hammer Curls 4x8-12, Dumbbell Lateral Raises 4x8-12.\n\n###**Day 4 \u2013 Sumo Deadlift and Front Squats**\n\n**Accessories -**\nSuper set Barbell Rows 4x8-12 and Pull ups 4x6-10, Core (Usually weighted decline bench sit ups)\n\n###**Day 5 \u2013 Heavy Bench day and Spoto Press**\n\nI used to do close-grip bench but it would aggravate my right elbow a lot and I suffered from some minor tendinitis so I stopped. I switched it to Spoto Press to work on where I normally fail on bench.\n\n**Accessories -**\nIncline Dumbbell Curls 4x8-12, Superset Facepulls 4x12-15 and Cable Overhead Tricep Pulls 4x8-12, Dumbbell Curls 4x10-12 (slow and at a lighter weight)  \n\n###**Day 6 \u2013 Squats and Conventional Deadlift**\nThe weight is lighter and this is an easy day. I work on form and speed out of the hole on squat on this day. \n\n**Accessories -** Depends on time. Usually calf raises because I never target them, and Lat Pulldown, and bent over rows. \n\n#**Other Exercise:** \nRecreational Soccer once or twice a week.\nEither a light 15 min jog or an easy 30 mins on a stationary bike 2-3 times a week.\n\n#**Other Measurements:**\nAll taken with no pump (taken on rest days/didn't life prior to measurement).\n\nAll measurements were taken in inches. Taken on random days starting in 2017.\n\n | 2-2-17 | 8-31-17 | 1-15-18 | 3-12-18 | 8-26-18 | 10-3-18 | Today (1-3-18)\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----\nChest | 36 | 40 | 41.5 | 42 | 41 | 41.5 | 42.5\nArms | 13 1/3 | 14 | 14.5 | 15 | 14.5 | 15 | 15 1/3\nThigh| unknown | 22 | 23 | 24 | 23.25 | 24 | 24.5\nCalf| unknown| 15 | 15 | 15 1/3 | 15 | 15 1/3 | 15.5\nWeight | unknown | 155lbs | 165lbs | 170lbs | 160lbs | 166lbs | 165lbs\n\nChest- current 43 inches\nArm current  15 1/3 inches \nThigh current 24.5\nCalf 15.5\n\n**Clothing Size:** \n\nShirts - I went from mostly wearing men\u2019s x-small and smalls to a mix of mediums and larges.\n\nPants/Shorts - I tend to wear joggers a lot because my legs are big and my waist is small so my jeans/other pants are now either real tight in the leg area or real loose in the waist department. \n\n#**The Future:** \nI am planning on switching my program up and start to train heavy singles for my first meet. I also no longer have as much time as time to lift as I previously did, so I will be switching off of **nsuns** soon as it takes forever.\nI lost some weight over my winter break from school as I fell out of my eating routine, but my lifts didn\u2019t go down which is nice. I am planning on continuing to bulk for the foreseeable future or until I hate how I look as I still have visible ab definition.\n\n#**Goals:**  \n**Short Term -** Not place last at my meet in February lol.\n\n**Long term -** I really want to pull a 500+ deadlift, Squat 450, and Bench over 315.\n\nThis community is a great place and I am really glad that it's been here for me since the start. \n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that I also take Creatine.

Well, they're just lazy.\n\n2) Did someone make exceptional gains in a progress post?  Well, they must be on steroids.\n\n3) Countless threads where the poster is asking a question along the lines of, \"I heard that when I did 'x,' 'y' was supposed to happen.  When I tried 'x,' 'y' didn't happen.  What's wrong with me?\"\n\nHere's the deal, though:  you can be a long way from average while still being perfectly normal.  The assumption that people cluster really close to the average (for pretty much anything related to lifting, at least) is wrong.\n\nLet me give you an example.\n\nI recently snagged a huge dataset with all of the USAPL's competition results since 2008.  I was curious to see whether someone's level of strength is predictive of how quickly they'll continue gaining strength (we assume that weaker people predictably have a pretty easy time getting stronger, whereas stronger people take a lot longer to see meaningful progress).  So, I narrowed it down to the people who showed up in the database multiple times, and calculated their average rate of strength gains per day.\n\nWhen I plotted every *individual* result, there was actually **almost no relationship** between how strong someone was and the rate their strength increased between meets.  However, when I grouped people together by strength level, *group* averages were almost perfectly predictive of how quickly someone could gain strength.\n\nYou can read about all of that in more depth here to see that dichotomy graphically.  The difference is pretty striking, really:  **[Group Data Don't Tell You Much About Individuals](http://gregnuckols.com/2017/04/24/group-data-dont-tell-much-individuals/)**\n\nHere are a couple other examples from published research:\n\n[#1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7794282_Variability_in_muscle_size_and_strength_gain_after_unilateral_resistance_training)\n\nHUGE sample size (585 people).  On the same training program, average increase in muscle cross-sectional area was 19%, but there were people with increases of 50%+.  Over 1/3 of the people gained muscle at less than half the average rate, while quite a few people gained muscle at over twice the normal rate.  Ditto with strength.  Average increase in 1RM was 54%, but quite a few people had increases of 100%+ and a lot had increases of less than 25%.\n\n[#2](http://jap.physiology.org/content/102/6/2232.long)\n\nAlso a pretty big sample (66 people).  In this study, they grouped people based on how well they responded, with low responders being roughly the bottom 1/4, high responders being roughly the top 1/4, and modest responders being the middle ~half of the group.  The low responders didn't have a meaningful increase in muscle fiber size, and the high responders made *double* the gains of the typical modest responder.\n\nIn both of these examples, you can see a lot of people who were a long way from *average* but who were still perfectly *normal.*  The second study is a particularly good example \u2013 the high responder and low responder groups weren't anomalies \u2013 they combined to make up almost half of the subjects!\n\nIf I'm trying to get one thing across in this post, this is it:  **average** and **normal** are two entirely different things.  \"Average\" is a single point and \"normal\" is a range.  Crucially, it's a MUCH bigger range than most people expect.  The range of perfectly normal responses to training is enormous.\n\nI'm not sure how much this post will change the day-to-day conversation in this sub, but hopefully it'll help at least a little bit.  If you're making slower gains than average but you're training your ass off, don't worry about it too much \u2013 you're below average, but you're still normal.  If you are a lot stronger than most other people, you may be better than average, but don't get too big-headed about it \u2013 you're still normal (unless you're winning world championships, but that's not going to apply to many people here).\n\n**Focus on what you can control**, advise other people to focus on what they can control, and let the results take care of themselves.

In addition, We actually **have** had short stints of weightlifting in the past; in 7th grade (12 years old) for two semesters for 45 minutes a day, the first semester of freshmen year for an hour twice a week (football conditioning, though we both quit before the season started), and the summer before our senior year for an hour twice a week (track conditioning; they added conditioning during our senior year). This was mentioned in our very first progress post, but wanted to reiterate it because a few people were upset on our last one for not doing so. Two years ago was when we got a gym membership for the purpose of lifting.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n**Training**: Like mentioned in our previous post, we hopped on N-Suns LP Program about 7 or so months after starting. Before that, we sorta just messed around in the gym. We had a \u201cprogram\u201d, but it wasn\u2019t really good. It didn\u2019t have a progression protocol, a deloading protocol, no periodization. It was something we just made up. We strongly recommend against this route. Go on a program. Any in the wiki will do. You can see how much our progress changed from our first post 7-months in and our second 1-year update post. The changes in our dieting and going on a program contributes significantly to this progress. \r\n\r\nWe took the liberty up uploading template programs. We did this because during our first progress post, very many people just could not see the program for whatever reason. It was uploaded to Imgur, and some commenters said they could, but the amount of DMs we got stating they could not was absolutely overwhelming. They are not EXACTLY what we did because we modified our programs as we needed, but they are a very solid backbone of what we did. You should include whatever accessories you want. Our accessories focused on movements in so that we can increase our strength and improve lagging body parts in our physiques.\r\n\r\nProgram 1: [Starks Twins\u2019 LP template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z00ocHkvOQQddMD6Dp8_JNmIJFV-JCAeuXS9u6RN_e8/edit). This is the program we modified based on n-suns. We did not like doing T2 lifts at all so we took them out, then altered the structure as time went on. \r\n\r\nProgram 2: [Starks Twins\u2019 Weekly Undulating Periodization template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B1hXdmAIX_7bHZ-LUUjPqvIWMGsJqZNKlX50CRGQNKw/edit#gid=2045453449). This is actually a further modification from our once-every-two-week progression program that we uploaded during our progress post last year and what we currently run. The idea is that we have a week of lower intensity and higher volume, a week of moderate intensity and moderate volume, and a week of higher volume and lower intensity. During the low-intensity weeks, you have a 1+ where you increase the weight depending on how many reps you get for it. This only applies for squat and deadlift. For bench, it\u2019s actually more of a DUP-style program where you have a day of low volume/high intensity, moderate volume/intensity, and high volume/low intensity. You still increase the weight every 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nWe make our own programs because we enjoy it. We don\u2019t really recommend it. Perhaps we could get more progress by jumping on something like Shieko, and maybe we will sometime in the future, but for the time being, we\u2019ve made reasonable progress so we\u2019re going to stick to this until we no longer are making reasonable progress.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Diet**: IIFYM. We actually lowered the threshold from our last post from 200 grams of protein minimum to 1g/lb of bodyweight. We do like to stick to 200 during our cuts because our deficits are pretty large (will explain why momentarily) and we like to minimize muscle loss as much as we can, but we don\u2019t stress if we only get to 175 or so. \r\n\r\nLooking back at our old progress post, we can\u2019t believe we overlooked a VERY big detail regarding how we approach dieting. We do mini-cycles. We remember asking [on Reddit]( https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5vtvrq/anybody_who_has_done_minicutbulk_cycles_what/) if anyone had any experience with it and got pretty negative answers. Nevertheless, we decided to give it a shot. Very glad we did because it was incredibly successful and we would definitely recommend it to those who are curious about it. The shortest cycle we\u2019d recommend would be 4 weeks of bulking followed with two weeks of cutting (though we\u2019ve done 6 weeks/3 weeks, 8 weeks/4 weeks, 10 weeks/5 weeks, etc). The bulking would be at a surplus of 350-500 calories and the cutting would be at a deficit of 700-1500 calories. We did harsher deficits when cutting for a competition to make our weight classes. We actually did not notice significant muscle loss regardless of what our deficit was, and any decrease in strength returned within the first 3 weeks of the subsequent bulk.\r\n\r\nFor reference, we also have done a longer cycle of 6 months of bulking, followed by a two month cut. We made very good progress on that one as well. They are both very valid strategies to approaching bulk/cut cycles in our experience, and we would recommend to do whichever you prefer.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n**Benefits**\r\n\r\nWe decided to do a mini-section on how our lives has improved since starting a lifting regime. We would be lying if we were to say that increasing our physical attractiveness wasn\u2019t a primary motivator when starting to work out. And while we like to think we succeeded in that regard, the benefits of working out extends far beyond an improvement in looks. Most noticeably, our confidence and self-esteem has skyrocketed in the last two years. We don\u2019t really talk about this often, but growing up, we didn\u2019t really have any friends at all. The situation somewhat improved in middle school, and even moreso in high school. But even still, we were always shy and tended to keep to our small group of friends. Nowadays, we\u2019re much more confident and self-assured, especially in social situations. We don\u2019t have to overanalyze the things we say, which in terms had a huge effect on both our demeanor and the way people perceive us. Moreover, we\u2019re generally happier and much more disciplined, especially regarding things like time management. All in all, we can confidently say that lifting has significantly improved our lives for the better.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n**Competing:** \r\n\r\nYou can read about our first competition in our 1-Year Update post. Since then, Austin has competed in one more meet and Justin has competed in two. We both compete in the USAPL powerlifting federation. You can read about our second meet together [here]( https://old.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/7ayqq7/meet_report_ivy_league_championships_5325_kg_660/). Justin\u2019s third meet did not go very well due to an injury that will be elaborated on in a later section. \r\n\r\nHighlights include a state-record deadlift from Justin. His PR deadlift is also only 25 pounds from the USAPL national collegiate record in the 74kg weight class, so his goal is to break it before graduating from college. In addition, Austin\u2019s PR squat is only 45 pounds away from the USAPL collegiate squat record, so he hopes he\u2019s able to break it by next April so that he can move up a weight class permanently. \r\n\r\nAustin\u2019s wilks is actually higher than Justin\u2019s. Officially in-competition, it\u2019s about .5 wilks point higher at 418.3 (vs Justin\u2019s 417.8), but Austin\u2019s projected for his next competition is ~450, vs Justin\u2019s ~440, if everything goes to plan. We\u2019re hoping to graduate with at least a 490. It\u2019s optimistic and we will elaborate on why it\u2019s so optimistic in the last section.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Set-backs**\r\n\r\nWe actually both had set-backs that has affected our progress. In January of this year, Austin had a lower back injury. Originally, it felt like extreme soreness, but it never went away. Eventually, Austin stopped squatting/deadlifting (and at this point decided to not compete in the third meet that Justin eventually competed in) and went to a physical therapist. They believe it was a bulging disc, and helped him with rehab exercises. This is also when we decided to implement stretching into our regime: particularly in the glutes and hips. We wanted to include this section to emphasize the importance of mobility work. In fact, Austin strongly believes his hip/glute stretches contributed significantly more to his recovery than most of the stretches his PT recommended. We did absolutely no mobility work before, and unfortunately Austin suffered the consequences for them.\r\n\r\nJustin\u2019s injury was unrelated; he pulled a glute muscle in March peaking for USAPL Collegiate Nationals. We don\u2019t really think this injury was avoidable as he was doing fairly light sets, but he does feel it contributes to his lack of progress, particularly lack of squat progress, so he felt like it was worth noting.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n**Supplements**\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t take any currently, though we do recommend creatine and fish oil. We personally had to stop creatine because it gave us migraines, and we just haven\u2019t gotten around to ordering another bottle of fish oil which is the reason we\u2019re not currently taking it.\r\n\r\nAnd because it\u2019s been historically asked in the past, we do not take PEDs. Our biggest proof is the [drug tests](https://imgur.com/a/fnNugCP) involved in competing in the USAPL.\r\n\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, one of us got our [testosterone checked](https://i.imgur.com/K6lwIn7.png) rather recently if that is of any interest. We don\u2019t really know how to read it, but our free testosterone was 0.1 below the stated threshold, so I guess one can conclude that we have pretty good genetics in terms of muscle building (again, we don\u2019t really know how to read it, so if our conclusion was off-base, please feel free to correct us in the comments).\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n**Takeaways**\r\n\r\nTraditionally, we have ended our progress posts with some advice that we hope people can benefit from. We decided to continue that tradition, and list 5 pieces that people who read this post could benefit from.\r\n\r\n1. Set unrealistic goals for yourself. Did you know that at the point Justin decided that he wanted to break the Georgia State record, he was sitting at a 460lb deadlift and the meet was a month and a half away? During the meet, he tied it at 501 pounds, and shattered it 4 months later at 540 pounds, weighing 10 less pounds than the 74kg threshold. If you were to ask anybody if a 40 pound jump, while needing to cut for the meet, was feasible, they would laugh at you. But we strongly believe that setting unrealistic goals significantly affected our progress. A year ago, we had reasonable physiques. Of course we could\u2019ve just maintained, maybe bulk up a bit to be at a more sustainable bodyfat, and cruise. But instead, we opted to give ourselves large goals and strove to achieve them. We actually don\u2019t achieve them all of the time, but the act of trying is what will give you progress\r\n\r\n2. READ THE /r/fitness WIKI. This is the most comprehensive online free fitness guide that we have ever encountered. When people DM us asking questions (either on Reddit or on our social media pages), we mostly refer them to the Wiki because it is an extremely good resource. It is long because of how comprehensive it is. If you were to memorize every single thing in the wiki, you would know everything you need to know to achieve the results you desire. Read it, read it again the next week, annotate it, then re-read for good measure.\r\n\r\n3. Programming. Unless you have a good amount of lifting experience, you should get on a program. Obviously we\u2019re biased towards ours, but honestly, any program in the wiki (READ IT) will do. People ask us all of the time why they aren\u2019t making progress, and those very people: A) are on some really bad, homemade program they made themselves and B) don\u2019t pay attention to their diet. Don\u2019t make this mistake. Get on a program.\r\n\r\n4. Dieting. We\u2019re not going to make the claim that you NEED to cut/bulk to make progress. But what we will say is that the people who don\u2019t make progress more often than not are eating at maintenance or just don\u2019t pay attention to their diet at all. We\u2019ve found that mini-cycles are a great alternative to recomping and strongly recommend them if the idea of bulking/cutting for months on end seems torturous to you. But you need to gain weight to gain muscle mass, and lose weight to lose fat mass (or at least it makes the process 100x faster).\r\n\r\n5. Consistency. Just go. Stop trying to wait for New Years. Stop trying to wait until you reach a certain weight. Stop trying to wait until you can do x amount of pushups. Seriously, you\u2019re only delaying your own progress. Just go, find a schedule that works for you, and stick to it. You\u2019re not going to make progress if you go all-out for 6 weeks before quitting because you burnt out. Make sustainable, life-long changes to your life. Your results will come, but you have to be patient and stay consistent.\n\nEDIT: blurred out some identifying info in our screenshot\n\nEDIT 2: We have a ton of people asking what stretches we do so here are each of them!

During a deep tissue massage, someone typically kneads their fingers/palms/elbows into you and it feels good... right?

It's something that many beginners don't do, especially if you sit a lot or work at a desk. Human asses are so big and shapely because they're one of the strongest muscles in our bodies and we are supposed to use them for almost everything. However, for many of us (me included), our modern societies have created a situation where our booties don't get regular use because we sit down all day -- in couches, in chairs, in cars, in subways -- to the point that when we *do* participate in an activity where a caveman would use their butt, we don't, because we're not used to it, and because it's no longer comparatively stronger than the surrounding muscles. If you don't use your butt to help you move around throughout the day, you're using your body wrong. Here are some helpful tips:\n\n* Overhead press: Squeeze your buttcheeks. You can't stabilize your core at higher weights without it.\n\n* Bench press: Squeeze your buttcheeks and you'll be able to put up a little more weight.\n\n* Deadlift: Squeeze your buttcheeks AS HARD AS YOU CAN.\n\n* Squat: You better believe you gotta squeeze them buttcheeks. *<-- See edit*\n\n*Edit: While this is true, you don't necessarily want to be thinking about squeezing your glutes the whole time. Just be sure to use your glutes/hips to drive yourself up, keep your core tight, and be sure to not use your lower back instead of your glutes. Look at [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3muq18/squeeze_your_buttcheeks/cvijqa8) for better info. Okay, back to the buttcheeks.*\n\n* Plank: Squeeze your buttcheeks.\n\n* When standing: Squeeze your buttcheeks, a little bit. This uses your butt instead of your lower back to stabilize you. If your lower back gets sore from standing a lot, this will help. If you have anterior pelvic tilt, this will also help correct it.\n\n**tl;dr:** Squeeze your buttcheeks.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Squeeze Your Buttcheeks", "post_ups": 3346, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3muq18/squeeze_your_buttcheeks/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:11.988230", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "GovSchwarzenegger", "post_created_utc": 1394830652.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "20fkgf", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 184, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3350, "post_selftext": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJU4piabznc&list=TLNJXNpqwuH6pGvdiFxcCvGejWPypLmpCy\n\nOK, so in competition, I never benched more than 500 and here I literally crushed it.

Apologize for the text wall. \n\nFirst two photos in the link I was 17 at 300 pounds/5 foot 10\n\nNext two was today at 24 years old and 185 pounds/6 foot\n\nAt first I ran my ass off and didn't eat anything. Extremely dumb but I knew nothing about fitness or nutrition. I was just trying to get in better shape for baseball. I went from 300 to 235 pretty quickly. I don't recommend that method at all. Highly stupid. \n\nI fucked around with weights for a while not really following any plan. I still ran a lot. Usually two miles a day. All I had for resistance work was a total gym. I got down to 185 and couldn't bench one plate because I had no muscle from running. \n\nAround 22 years old I started to get serious finally. My plan was essentially a bro split. Arms, chest, legs, shoulders, back, repeat. Stopped doing cardio completely. \n\nAll rep ranges were 8 to 12. I got my bench up to 205, squat to 245, and deadlift to 315. Not the best but I was content. \n\nJanuary of this year I started a pretty big bulk. I was usually eating around 2000 cals a day and I jumped it up to around 3500. My diet consisted of too much protein (I ate 225g at 185lbs) and probably close to 10 servings of potatoes a day. I also followed intermittent fasting which is crazy to do bulking but I have a stupid big stomach apparently. \n\nI quickly shot up from 185 to 207 by March. My maxes went to 260 bench, 300 squat, and 400 deadlift. \n\nI always saw that people would cut and not lose strength and I didn't know how. Every time I would cut I would go from 3000 to 1700 calories and expect good results. I would essentially crash and then cheat and binge. It was a never ending circle. \n\nI finally decided to get some discipline in March and tracked everything I ate with my fitness pal. Every week I would get on the scale and monitor my weight. Subtracting calories from 3000 little by little. \n\nIn the gym I would do legs, shoulders, back and biceps, chest, repeat. I keep my rest times long and focus on compounds for the first part of the workout. Usually 8 sets of 2 or 5 sets of 5. Then I would move on to a 6 to 8 rep range for 5 sets. Then I would finish with a 10 to 12 rep range for 5 sets.\n\nExample leg day - 8 sets of 2 deadlift. 5 sets of 5 squat. 4 sets of 10 lunges. 5 sets of 12 leg curl. Done.  \n\nThis worked incredibly well and while taking away calories I have kept my strength in all exercises or went up in strength. \n\nMy diet right now (close to the end of my cut) consists of 1900 calories. 150 to 160 protein. Rest is filled how you like. Leg day is more carbs. Shoulder day is less carbs, etc. 5 grams of creatine a day. A shitload of water as well. \n\nUsually I eat two servings of cream of wheat before my workout in the am. A potato with no fat cheese after working out. Then dinner is a huge bowl of zucchini, cauliflower, spinach, avocado and chicken. Never get tired of it and so good. \n\nI look forward to finally putting on some much needed mass and will do it exactly how I did my cut. Slow and controlled. \n\nI will be happy to answer any and all questions that anyone has! \n\nEdit : THANKS to everyone that has replied on here. Fucking amazing. I'm trying to answer everyone's questions. As one comment said, I am not special. I am normal. You can do it. Anyone can do it. So go do it. \n\nEdit 2: http://imgur.com/5nGGCTX\nMy legs. \n\nEdit 3: http://imgur.com/6vnRGSu\nBack.

Unfortunately I think I just missed the spacebar \u2013 this guide isn't about Olympic lifting, and I'm sorry for any confusion. \n\nA couple of weeks ago I wrote [a guide on consistently going to the gym](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/49ubxy/i_made_a_guide_to_help_you_stop_being_lazy_and/) that had a pretty awesome response. As part of that response, I had a lot of people ask me about what programs they should start out on. A few people asked in the comments section as well. \n\nNow, the /r/fitness wiki has a ton of super useful info, but there are often still posts asking for beginner routines. I think the wiki is a great resource, but it can also be tough to pick a program when you\u2019re faced with so many options. \n\nTo be clear, I think the most effective program is the one you can stick to. Still, it can be nice to have more information to work with.\n\nWith that in mind, I wrote another guide (sorry, this one is also long), this time on what you should be looking for in a beginner program. It covers the aspects of a program that help you be consistent, the aspects of a program that get you results, and the types of exercises that a good program includes. \n\n**Part 1** covers the aspects of a program that help you be consistent:\n\n* **Time:** How long does your program take?\n* **Complexity:** How confusing is your program?\n* **Progression:** Can you see yourself making progress?\n* **Punishment:** How do you feel after a workout?\n* **Credibility:** Do you believe that your program will get results?\n\nReducing time commitments, complexity, and punishment while increasing progression and credibility make you more likely to stick to a program. \n\n**Part 2** covers the aspects of a program that get you results:\n\n1. A focus on compound exercises\n1. Built-in progressive overload\n\nAny effective intro program is going to emphasize gradually adding weight to compound exercises.\n\n**Part 3** covers the main exercise movements that a good program includes:\n\n* **Hinge:** Movements that involve bending the hip without much bending of the knees\n* **Squat:** Movements that involve bending the hip and the knees\n* **Push:** Movements that push things away from you or push you away from things\n* **Pull:** Movements that pull things towards you or pull you towards things\n\nThe programs in the wiki typically have these, but in my experience a lot of beginners sub out exercises that they don\u2019t like. Hopefully understanding exercise categories can reduce that, or at least help pick better exercise substitutions. \n\nAfter that I talk a little bit about unilateral exercises and warm-ups. \n\nMy guess is that people here will have more opinions about this than they did about my last post. \n\nWhat do you think makes an introductory program effective?\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "I wrote a guide to help you choose a beginner weighlifting program", "post_ups": 3326, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4c7ha6/i_wrote_a_guide_to_help_you_choose_a_beginner/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:11.988230", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Dap713", "post_created_utc": 1497271431.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "6grz83", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 217, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3321, "post_selftext": "I\u2019ve been a long time lurker on this sub and have pretty much built my entire exercise life around /r/fitness, thank you so much for everything.\n\nObligatory before and after pictures, nice and early in the post: http://imgur.com/a/kVsiA (scroll to the bottom for most recent pic)\n\n**My life:** I\u2019ve been working out for 5 years, but I\u2019ve been traveling around the world and doing freelance consulting for the last 2 years (shout out to /r/digitalnomad). The first 3 years, I consistently went to the gym almost every day. When I started traveling, I knew it was going to be different, but I didn\u2019t realize HOW different. I went/go to the gym whenever convenient, but in many of the places I end up, it\u2019s difficult. I knew things had to change, so I bought some elastic bands I take with me everywhere I go and it\u2019s been awesome. This is a progress update from the last 2 years of traveling and doing a combination of gym + what I like to call *airport* exercises.\n\n**May 25th, 2015 > Today (5\u20199\u201d 21 years old)**\n\n**Weight:** 187lbs > 216lbs\n\n**Bench (1RM):** 225lbs > 320lbs\n\n**Squat (1RM):** 295lbs > 410lbs\n\n________________\nI try to work out every single day of the week if possible, but about half the time, that doesn\u2019t mean going to the gym. Some disagree with me when I say it, but sticking to 5X5 is the way to go for me. This post isn\u2019t going to be about 5X5 or the gym, though. I\u2019m going to talk a little bit about how I supplemented NOT having access to a gym. First off, your body is the most amazing set of weights that you have. You can stand up from your seat right now and crank out a bunch of push ups, I\u2019m sure some of you just did. You can further enhance body-weight exercises by getting elastic bands and learning to use them properly. Seriously, if you ever think you are going to be away from your gym and missing a workout, I cannot more highly recommend anything as portable and effective. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve been couchsurfing, in airports, hiking, or just in a new city that doesn\u2019t have gyms with day passes. It\u2019s hard to ask in Urdu to use a gym for a few days, especially when you don\u2019t speak Urdu.  \n\n[Here are the elastic bands I\u2019ve been using since February](https://www.joshuatreedepot.com/collections/resistance-bands-heavy-duty-latex) (had another set but they wore down, these are my favorites so far). I recommend getting a set instead of a single band because different exercises require different levels of resistance. Also, I quickly progressed and didn\u2019t need some of the lower resistance bands at all any more, I ended up giving the lighter ones away to fitness freaks & geeks I\u2019ve met along the way.\n\n[Here is a pdf of band exercises.](https://www.acefitness.org/getfit/rubrbndwkout.pdf) It looks like it is stolen from a middle school health book, but this is actually a really great place for first time/novice elastic band users to start. I followed this pretty closely but tweak my workouts depending on what accessory day I\u2019m on.  Unless I had a crazy night and didn\u2019t sleep a ton, I don\u2019t take breaks in between sets. Each cycle of exercises takes about 10-12 minutes to complete, I can be done in 45-60 minutes which would be roughly the same amount of time I\u2019d spend at the gym, if not less.\n\n**Diet:**\nFish. So much fish. Cans of fish. Fresh fish. Nigiri. Filets. Sashimi. Every day. Salmon in my eggs, tuna in my sandwich, shrimp in my salads. Unfortunately meal prep is very rarely an option for me, but fish almost always is. I\u2019ve only had red meat once so far this year, and they were the most delicious rocky mountain oysters I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nI\u2019ve basically made it a rule to make myself eat seafood with every meal, it\u2019s where I get all of my protein. I know a lot of people can\u2019t afford to do this without eating tuna all of the time, but a nice alternative is to buy some salmon filets from a local butcher and bake/grill/sear those with some Cajun spices + lemon slices. Delicious, fast, sexy, tons of protein.\n\nI take creatine, multi-vitamins, fish oil, and caffeine daily. My cut bulk is relatively cyclical, I tend to do slow cuts and fast bulks (2 month cut, 1 month bulk), usually staying roughly 400-800 calories above/below maintenance. I try to eat above 200g of protein daily, I also tend to eat a lot of carbs and don\u2019t have the highest fat diet. I used to use MFP, but have been eyeballing it since I started traveling and occasionally looking up new foods for estimates. \n\nOther important junk:\n\n* Sticking to my commitments was the number one thing that helped me above all else. Even with just an elastic band for the majority of my work outs, I was able to achieve results I am extremely happy with.\n\n* Sleep. I\u2019ve got a million red eye flights which I used to fill with movie time, now, I force myself to catch as much sleep as possible, even if it means I can\u2019t watch Shawshank Redemption for the 11th time.\n\n* Research, Google, watch Youtube videos. Especially when it came to doing work outs on the go, I ended up doing a lot of those corny video classes where there is some jacked lady nicely shout-encouraging you.\n\n* Bands are not a replacement for heavy lifting in the gym, but they are a great supplement. You can always size up on the amount of resistance weight.\n\n* I really can\u2019t thank /r/fitness enough for all of the amazing content and resources available, you guys are collectively my hero.\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "2 Year Progress While Traveling and Having Low Gym Access (tons of reliance on body weight exercises)", "post_ups": 3321, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/6grz83/2_year_progress_while_traveling_and_having_low/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:11.988230", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Anthrax89", "post_created_utc": 1428639213.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1428695104.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "3231dx", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 286, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3315, "post_selftext": "Having read a few articles recently [like this one from Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexmorrell/2015/03/12/lawsuits-say-protein-powders-lack-protein-ripping-off-athletes/) regarding companies amino spiking their protein powders to increase their profit margins, I had an idea to do some of my own investigation.  \n  \nHow interested is the fitness community in some non-biased testing?

When all heads of the deltoid contract at the same time, this muscle serves to [abduct the arm](http://www.nolanlee.com/uploads/3/0/9/6/30966409/4256350.jpg?365).  Another lesser known function of the deltoids as a whole is to prevent the dislocation of the humerus (upper arm) when someone lifts heavy loads. Have you ever performed heavy shrugs, deadlifts, or [farmer\u2019s walks](http://crossfitzone.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/farmers-carry-strongman.jpg), and noticed that your delts look huge while you\u2019re doing them? It\u2019s because they\u2019re working hard to make sure that the weight you\u2019re lifting doesn\u2019t rip your arm out of your socket. But each head of the deltoid also serves an individual purpose.\n\n>*Anterior Deltoid*\n\n>* Primarily used to abduct the shoulder when the arm is [externally rotated](http://teleanatomy.com/General%20Anatomy/Introduction%20to%20Anatomy%203rd%20Edition/Term%20movement_files/image030.jpg), [flexes the arm at the shoulder](http://www.orthopedicsatoz.org/OrthopedicsAtoZ/media/OrthopedicsAtoZ/Images/Exercises/Shoulder_07.jpg), and [internally rotates the arm](http://o.quizlet.com/HWvxEOwhMe7lo41.otLytg_m.png)\n\n>*Lateral Deltoid*\n\n>* Primarily used to abduct shoulder when the arm is internally rotated\n\n>*Posterior Deltoid*\n\n>* Primarily used to the [extend the arm at the shoulder](http://www.mskcc.org/sites/www.mskcc.org/files/node/%5Bnid%5D/images/armexercise8.png) \n\n>**TRAINING TIPS**\n\n>Due to their numerous functions, deltoids are involved in almost every upper body workout, and many lower body workouts as well (ex. deadlift). Since they are used so often, they are very easy to injure.  It is very important to make sure you warm up and get blood flowing in your deltoids before you begin your workout so you can prevent injuries.  [Bryce Lewis demonstrates a great upper body warm up here](http://youtu.be/eGsMoJW-RDY?t=1m) (I usually do the warm up from 1:00 \u2013 2:33).\n\n>To maximize deltoid development, it is important to train each individual head optimally.  A typical deltoid workout for myself includes one exercise for each part of the muscle. \n\n>**ANTERIOR DELTOID TRAINING**\n\n>This head of the deltoid is used very often in pressing movements. This includes bench press, and other chest movements that move in a similar plane.  Due to this, many people, myself included, do not think that isolation work (front raises) for the anterior deltoid is necessary for the average gym goer (if you are a bodybuilder, I wouldn\u2019t neglect isolation work for any muscle).  These are my favourite exercises for the anterior deltoid:\n\n>* [Standing military press](http://youtu.be/lwOYmash-xA?t=16s) \n\n>* [Overhead Dumbbell Press](http://youtu.be/C-TjVJoI7D0?t=1m14s) \n\n>* [Arnold Press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odhXwoS3mDA) \n\n>Standing military press is a great way to develop both deltoid mass and strength. One of the biggest benefits of the military press, in my opinion, is its carry over to bench press strength. Whenever my military press weight increases, so does my bench press. The same can't be said for my dumbbell press.  \nI like training my pressing movements in both high and low rep ranges.  I often start with heavier weights and stick around 6-8 reps, and then move to 8-12 reps towards the end of my pressing.\n\n>**LATERAL DELTOID TRAINING**\n\n>When training the deltoids through isolation work, most of my time is spent on the lateral head.  Training this part of the deltoid is what will give them that round look from the front, and will make them [\u201cpop\u201d](https://www.t-nation.com/system/publishing/articles/459/original/Big_Scary_Delts.jpg?1391031094). This head is not worked during pressing movements to the extent that the anterior head is, so it's important to use isolation exercise to target it. \n\n>* [Lateral dumbbell raises](http://youtu.be/8g30LfuYJDo?t=3m53s) \n\n>* [Behind the back lateral cable raises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihG4lDlTJ-g) \n\n>Although lateral dumbbell raises are a very common exercise, I often see people performing them incorrectly. Remember that the function of the lateral deltoid is to raise the arm, when it is internally rotated. Many people forget this, and perform raises with an externally rotated arm. [This video by Ian McCarthy](http://youtu.be/yS2AAd_E0R0?t=1m23s) is a great demonstration on how to perform them correctly. The same rule with internal rotation also applies to cable raises. \n\n>For raises, it is very important to use light weight and perform these in a higher rep range (10+).\n\n>**POSTERIOR DELTOID TRAINING**\n\n>This is often the most neglected part of deltoid training.  Many people believe that back training alone will target this muscle efficiently, but in order to fully develop the deltoid, and make sure that they are visible when people look at you from behind, you must work this head with isolation exercises. Neglecting posterior deltoid work can be detrimental to your shoulder health as well. Most people engage in so much pressing work, and often underwork pulling movements, leading to muscular imbalances. \n\n>* [Rear Delt Flys](http://youtu.be/o5OvdIVV61M?t=33s) \n\n>* [Face Pulls](http://youtu.be/HSoHeSjvIdY?t=35s) \n\n>I prefer doing rear delt flys on the machine because I can control the movement throughout the entire range of motion, and can really feel a contraction in them.  Face pulls are an extremely beneficial exercise for your rear deltoids and overall shoulder health.\n\n**TL:DR**\n\n* Deltoids have three heads: posterior, anterior, lateral\n\n* Overall function is to abduct the arm, but each head has a specific function\n\n* Anterior deltoid abducts the shoulder when the arm is externally rotated\n\n* Lateral deltoid abducts shoulder when the arm is internally rotated\n\n* Posterior deltoid extends the shoulder\n\n* Always warm up thoroughly \n\n* Isolation isn't necessary for anterior head unless you are a bodybuilder\n\n* Use presses for anterior head, and isolation exercises for lateral and posterior head  ", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Deltoids 101: An Anatomical Guide to Training", "post_ups": 3307, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2xxa7l/deltoids_101_an_anatomical_guide_to_training/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:11.988230", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Dexcov", "post_created_utc": 1493561324.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1493662368.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "68fm4b", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 514, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3298, "post_selftext": " Hello r/Fitness!\n\n**EDIT:** Reposted from an hour ago to remove IG info from original post.\n\nI wanted to take a little time this fine Sunday  morning to share with you a 1-Year transformation I'm in the midst of. \n\nNow, I want the major takeaways from this post to be the few things I've learned so far in this journey:\n\n\n**1.)** Diet is key. But not all diets are created equal.\n\n\n**2.)** If you make the decision to change your eating/exercise habits to improve the way you look and feel, make sure you're invisioning the amount of work it'll take to get there, and *not* just the end result.\n\n\n**3.)** Once the feeling of giving up hurts *more* than the draining early morning gym sessions and undying hunger for comfort food, you're succeeding. \n\n\n**4.)** As early on as possible, find out how your body (and mind) reacts to different diets/supplements/routines, and implement the things that benefit your path to success and don't come with a heavy opportunity cost.  The gym is your lab, science the shit out of it and don't waste any time.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo after graduating college I was one of those roller-coaster dieters. I'd eat healthy for a week, then binge, then workout as if I'm about to be cast in some high-budget action blockbuster. A month would go by, and I'd once again slip back into my routine of unhealthy choices, undoing any progress I'd made up until that point. Overall, I just found myself in an unsatisfying loop of inconsistency and mediocre results. \n\n\n\n\nBack in May of 2016, I decided it was officially time to revamp my ever-tiring metabolism before it once again lost the battle to a late-night pile of French fries and some serious morning-mirror-jiggles. \n\n\nHere's how I did it: \n\n\n\n***Engage Ludicrous dieeettttttt***\n\n\n\n**Breakfast:**\n\n\n(1) Serving of *Legion* GENYSIS Greens Superfood\n\n* Carbs : 10g\n* Protein : 4g\n* Fat : 0.5g\n\n(6) Hard Boiled Egg whites (no yolk)\n\n* Carbs : 0g\n* Protein : 22g\n* Fats : 0g\n\n\n(1 oz) Justin's Classic Peanut Butter \n\n* Carbs : 7g\n* Protein : 8g\n* Fat : 16g\n\n\n**Lunch #1 and Lunch #2**\n\nPlease note: I eat the following meal @ 11:30am & 2:30pm.\n\n(61g) Boiled Canned Chicken\n\n* Carbs : 0g\n* Protein : 36g\n* Fat : 4g\n\n\n(142g) Cubed Butternut Squash\n\n* Carbs : 15 g\n* Protein : 1g\n* Fat : 1g\n\n\n(1 cup) Trader Joe's Rice Medley \n\n* Carbs : 42g\n* Protein : 5g\n* Fats : 1.5g\n\n\n**Dinner**\n\n(2 cups) diced Sweet Potato\n\n* Carbs : 84g\n* Protein : 4g\n* Fat : 0g\n\n(6) Hard Boiled Egg whites (no yolk)\n\n* Carbs : 0g\n* Protein : 22g\n* Fat : 0g\n\n**Post Workout Meal**\n\n(1) Serving Protein Suppliment\n\n* Carbs : 0g\n* Protein : 40g\n* Fat : 0g\n\n**Daily Macros** (Split into 4 meals above)\n\n* Protein : 173g \n* Carbs : 215g\n* Fat : 27 g\n\n\n\n***LET'S USE THAT IN THE GYM NOW***\n\n\nHere's my [workout plan](https://i.imgur.com/2FFP6C8.png).\n\nThe typical time it takes to complete my workout is 90 minutes (Not including Cardio). \n\n**Please note:** I do 60 minutes of Fasted Cardio every Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday mornings. I also do 30 minutes of Low Intensity Steady-State cardio daily, prior to weightlifting.\n\nI almost exclusively use the StairMaster for my fasted cardio, and suppliment that with my heart rate monitor for 60 minutes. But, for my **LISS** cardio, I simply walk on a treadmill at 3.8 mph, at a 6.5 degree incline. This will change depending on your height and stride! I found this speed and grade kept my heart rate at about 135bpm, which is my target for this type of cardio.\n\n\nNow, before you embark on a similar road to a fitness level you're happy with, I recommend that you don't pay too much attention to the scale. Although it's a great tool in some instances (especially advanced-level muscle maintenance), it's not a very good indicator of how \"in-shape\" you're in. \n\n\n\n**PROGRESS PICTURES**\n\n\n\nI was 190 in the first picture, 186 in the second picture, 190 again in the third picture, and then cut down to 180 in the last picture [here.](https://imgur.com/a/qEoXU).\n\n\nPlease remember, I'm certainly not a professional. I just wanted to share some notes for the results I've found over the course of this past year, in hopes there is someone out there looking to change up their routine. With that being said, I think consistency is the key for being fit. Minor adjustments over a long period of time turn into lifestyle changes that reap a ton of benefits and rewards in the long run. Please feel free to ask me questions! I still eat like a monster every so often, I drink moderately every weekend, and I think this lifestyle is only sustainable if you're having fun with it!\n\nLove, Devin.\n\n\n**EDIT:** Typo on the shoulder day section! Should be 5 Sets of 5, NOT 25. Haha. Not *that* strong!\n\n\n\n**EDIT 2:** My workout plan is from bodybuilding.com, called the Blue Print to mass, from my personal hero, Arnold! I would link it directly, but I'm afraid this post might be flagged for spam if I do. Quick google search should lead to right to it!\n\n\n\n**EDIT 3:** Couple of reoccurring questions about the workout, let me save you some time having to dig through this thread:\n\n* 1.) The 25-30 Rep first set of any exercise is purely for warming up and getting my form right before adding weight.\n\n\n* 2.) I chose to significantly lower my fat intake because I have stomach issues with overconsumption.

Played high school and college sports (crew, rugby). Worked out consistently throughout undergrad and grad school.  \n\nSince then, have tried to stick to a regimen. At this point I do gym 3 times a week, rest day in between each, with cardio day thrown in one day over the weekend. I stick to combos of pairing a major muscle group, with minor per workout.

Usually do 4 sets with 12-15 reps of (what I consider) lighter weights for most exercises.  \n\nI've been able to maintain a sculpted look throughout the years; 6'2\", 170lbs, 41\" chest, 30\" waist.  \n\nAgain, not saying it would work for everyone, just my opinion and perspective.

It was first thing people saw on me. It was always main topic when people talked to me. \"Do you even eat anything?\" etc.  \nOne day I said \"Thats enough. I'll show you what I am capable of\", that was the day I purchased my first dumbbell and pullup bar. Worked out at home for a year before I got my drivers license and finally started working out in the gym. I was doing a lot of mistakes, but main one was that I followed bro-split for good year and a half before I realised I could do SO MUCH MORE. So I started following PPL routine in 2017. And I made some serious gains with it. I kind of modified it myself, down bellow you can check it out.  \n  \nI was always bulking, until this april. [I've bulked a little bit too dirty](https://imgur.com/a/GyrIkjo) last winter, came to my highest 79kg and I didnt like the extra fat on my abs so I quickly started my first cut on april 1st 2018, and I'm impressed how easy it actually is to lose fat while maintaining muscle mass. So far I came down to 72kg and the change is real.  \n  \nI plan to cut for one more week, then I'm off to vacations for a week, then maintain till september. In september I'll start LEAN bulking and hopefully reach 80kg while staying 10-12%. I'll optionally do mini cut before next summer.  \n  \n___\n\n**ROUTINE:**  \n\n_DAY 1: PULL A (BACK/BICEPS/TRAPS)_  \n  \nWeighted pullups 3x8, 1x bodyweight till failure  \n\nBarbell rows 4x8  \n\nCable rows 4x10  \n\nHammer crossover curls 4x10  \n\nIncline concentrate curls 4x10-12  \n\nBarbell shrugs 4x10  \n\n21's  \n  \n\n___  \n\n  \n_DAY 2: PUSH A (SHOULDERS/CHEST/TRICEPS)_  \n  \nMilitary press 4x6-8  \n\nIncline dumbbell press 4x8-10  \n\nArnold db press 4x8-10  \n\nIncline db flys 4x10  \n\nSupersets: side raises / rear flys / plate front raises 4x10-12  \n\nSuperset: Lying triceps extensions / plate chest press 4x10-12  \n\nSuperset: Tricep pushdowns 4x10-12 / abs  \n  \n___   \n\n  \n_DAY 3: LEGS_  \n  \nSquats 4x6-8  \n\nRomanian Deadlift 4x6-8  \n\nDumbbell walking lunges 4x10 each leg  \n\nSuperset: leg extensions / seated leg curls 4x10-12  \n\nSuperset: machine glute kickbacks 4x10-12 / calfraises 4x30 bodyweight  \n  \n___  \n  \n  \n_DAY 4: PULL B (BACK/BICEPS/TRAPS)_  \n  \nWeighted chinups 3x8, 1x bodyweight failure  \n\nOne arm dumbbell rows 4x8  \n\nPulldowns 4x10-12  \n\nBicep alternate curls 4x10-12  \n\nIncline hammer curls 4x10-12  \n\nDumbbell shrugs 4x10-12  \n\n21's  \n  \n___  \n  \n  \n_DAY 5: PUSH B (CHEST/SHOULDERS/TRICEPS)_  \n  \nDB press 4x8  \n\nShoulder dumbbell press 4x8-10  \n\nDB flys 4x10  \n\nSuperset: shoulder side raises / rear flys 4x10-12  \n\nSuperset: machine chest press / skullcrushers 4x10-12  \n\nSuperset: cable flys / tricep pushdowns 4x10-12  \n\nAB work  \n  \n___  \n  \n  \n_DAY 6 is the same as DAY 3._  \n  \n___  \n\n  \n**CALORIES**  \n\nMaintenance: 2700  \n\nBulk: 3000  \n\nCut: 2200  \n\n  \n**MACROS**  \n\nProtein: 160-170g  \n\nCarbs: 200g on cut, 370-400g bulk  \n\nFat: 70-90g  \n\n\n**DIET:**  \n  \n5:30AM    \n\n5 eggs + wholegrain bread OR 5 egg whites + wholegrain toast with peanut butter and banana, sometimes nuts  \n  \n\n7:30AM    \n\nIf I havent ate peanut butter for breakfast then I eat it here.

Thanks in advance for everything you guys.  \n\nEDIT: So this got a lot more attention than I expected with people asking for Workout routines and diet plans so here we go. If you see any glaring errors in the workouts or diet below feel free to let me know! Always looking to improve. \n\nEDIT: Okay people really? Stop reporting the post and get over yourselves I fixed it. Really going to be that anal about it?\n\n\nMy workout routine is six days a week, with one rest day in the middle. I also train abs every day at the end of each workout, Ill post the Ab workout towards the end. \n\nDay 1: Chest/Biceps/Abs\n\nIncline dumbbell press, 4x12\nBench press, 4x10\nCable Fly, 4x12\nChest Press Machine, 4x12\nDumbbell fly, 4x12\nPreacher EZ bar Curls, 4x12\nDumbbell curls, 3x10\nChin ups, 3x10\n*Ab Workout at the end*\n\nDay 2: Back/Triceps/Abs\n\nLat-Pulldowns, 4x10\nCable Rows, 4x12\nDumbbell Side Bend, 4x12\nOverhead Tricep Extensions, 4x12\nPull ups, 3x10\nDumbbell Rows, 4x12\n*Ab Workouts at the end*\n\nDay 3: Legs/Abs\n\nI use a variety of machines for leg day, pretty much ever machine my gym here has to offer. To be honest I don't know the names of all of them, so I will do the best I can. \n\nSquats Rack . I start on the squat rack first. Here I place my starting weight, about 120lbs and do two sets of ten. I then add another 25 lbs to each side, and do 1 set of 8 reps. Then add more weight and do 1 set of 6 reps. Going down in variables of two and adding more weight each time. This was shown to me by a classmate and I've been sticking with it, so far it works wonders. \n\nLunges. 20lbs in each hand (whatever weight works for you is fine. If you are just starting I recommend doing the first couple with little to no weight. The burn is more intense than you realize, especially when you just start. \n4 sets of 10. At this point my legs start to feel numb and shaky, and the most brutal part of the workout is over. \n\nLeg Press (horizontal) 4x10\n\nLeg Press (Elevated) 4x10\n\nLeg Extension machine, 4x12\n\n*End with abs*\n\nDay 4: Rest Day.\n\nGod I can't get over how important rest day is to the workout. My muscles are always in shock after the first three days, and its important to just give them time to rebuild. On rest days however don't turn into a massive couch potato. Try to be active somewhat. Go for a light jog, move around. Keep your blood flowing. Also if you are trying to gain weight like me, this is the best day to eat a lot!\n\nDay 5: Shoulder day\n\nSeated shoulder dumbbell press(90 degrees), 4x12\nSeated shoulder dumbbell press(45 degrees), 4x12\nEZ bar standing shoulder press, 5x12 (this one feels the best burn IMO)\nLateral raises, (90, 45, 0), 3x10 each\nOne arm Cable Raises, 4x120\n*Finish with abs*\n\nDay 6: Arm Day\n(every Teenage boy's favorite right?)\n\nOverhead Tricep Extensions, 5x20\nEZ bar curl 5x20\nHammer curl, 5x20\nOne Armed Cable Curl 5x20\nBench Dips, 5x20\nDB Preacher Curl, 5x20\nTricep Rope Pulldowns, 5x20\n2 Arm bar cable curl, 5x20\nWrist Curls, 5x20\nReverse Wrist Curls, 5x20\n\nThis workout is probably the most brutal, and I have only started doing it for the last two months. Go slow here, if you rush it you will wear out your arms and not be able to finish the whole workout. I learned that the hard way\n\nDay 6: Leg day #2. \n\n(See leg day above)\n\nAb workout: The way I workout my abs is a bunch of exercises in a row, followed by a rest of about a minute and a half. Then I repeat 2 more times. So the following workouts are done 3 times with a rest period between each set. \n\nStandard planks, 1 minute\nSide planks (both sides) 1 minute each\nLeg kickers (I think this is the right name for them) x20\nCrunches x20\nLeg rotators? I don't know the name for this one. But you lie on your back and place your hands under your butt. Then rotate the legs in a small circle counterclockwise, then clockwise the other way back. One rotation both ways is 1 full rep. Do this 10 times\n\nAfter every workout, I'm sure you have heart it many times here before, but you NEED protein within half an hour of each workout. I make my own \"Calorie shakes\", as I call them. They get me the protein I need after a workout as well as increase my calorie intake for the day drastically. \n3 ounces of whole milk, 5 scoops of ice cream. 2 bananas and two scoops of chocolate whey protein powder. \nThe entire thing comes out to about 1100 calories (Ballpark). \n\nDIET\n\nDiet is huge. Diet is so much huger than I realized when starting. My diet is pretty standard every day, and has massively helped me put on the weight I wanted. Also the majority of this diet comes from information I found here on /r/fitness! So thank you guys!\n\nBreakfast: 4 eggs, scrambled. Two packets of oatmeal, two scoops of peanut butter, mixed with a handful of raspberries. It makes it taste like a warm PB&J. I absolutely Love it. \n\nBetween breakfast and lunch I have a cliff bar or two, just to keep me from munching on unhealthy snacks. \n\nLunch: School food here at college isn't terrible, but normally I resort to making two PB&J's ( I love PB&J's), another large glass of milk, and a banana. \n\nDinner: . I do either one of two things for dinner. Chicken breasts from the store, or a burger from the college cafeteria. Pretty much anything over 800 calories filled with protein fits the bill for me. \n\nThank you guys for reading all of this. I appreciate all the kind words and help you've given me along the way. I'll do my best to answer any questions you have below!!\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "My 6 month Transformation from 105 to 140 lbs", "post_ups": 3274, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5bpywx/my_6_month_transformation_from_105_to_140_lbs/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:11.988230", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Eibhlin_Andronicus", "post_created_utc": 1431181789.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1431187761.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "35eacv", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 763, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3263, "post_selftext": "Some non-lifting news for ya'll from the world of athletics.

Over the past year or so of doing this consistently I've tried to tweak my routine to make the path to getting in the gym as easy as possible (especially important in the middle of winter).\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n1. When it's cold, I make sure to wear a long-sleeved shirt to bed. Makes leaving the cocoon of warmth in the AM much easier.\n\n\n2. I lay my clothes out the night before. Leave hoodie in kitchen, have jacket hanging on door, shoes underneath it.\n\n\n3. Have fresh fruit and yogurt waiting for me in the fridge. Fruit is the easiest thing for me to eat in the morning, and there's zero prep time.\n\n\n4. Pound water like it's my job.\n\n\n5. Make coffee the night before, ice that ish, have it ready to slug in the AM. If I'm feeling ambitious, I'll make ice cubes out of coffee so my iced coffee gets more iced coffee as it iced coffees. Feel me?\n\n\n6. Have keys, wallet, watch, headphones in a little pile by the door. Scoop and it up and head out.\n\n\n7. Also, (try to) get enough sleep.\n\n\n\nNot only is all this stuff nice to have when you're going through the motions, knowing you've got an organized morning prepped makes it way easier to get out of the covers in the first place. You all have anything to add to the mix?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold!\n\nEDIT 2: Ultimately, this is about efficiency - making whatever you've got go as far as possible.\n\nEDIT 3: My word /u/troythetoyboy was very right", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "A few quick ways to make it easier to get up for an early AM workout", "post_ups": 3239, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2zpgt2/a_few_quick_ways_to_make_it_easier_to_get_up_for/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:11.988230", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "gzcl", "post_created_utc": 1438656631.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "3fp96f", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 590, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3223, "post_selftext": "TLDR: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aisKTlsni80)\n\nHey Everyone, \n\n[2014 \"Most Helpful User\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2req7z/winners_of_the_rfitness_best_of_2014_awards/) here. My apologies for not being around too often lately. I've been busy work'n 'n stuff. \n\nThis weekend I reached a goal I had set out (secretly to myself of course cause those goals are best goals). This goal was to get my bench press and deadlift combined weight to be 1,000 pounds or more. \n\nIn other words, **to make the 1,000 lb. club in two lifts.**\n\nAnd I did just that. Here's a few things I learned along the way which you may find helpful. \n\nFirst, get quadriceps tendonitis. That way you cannot squat so it makes choosing what exercises to do so much easier! Psyche. Don't do that. I am however in that boat... so yeah :\\ USS Nosquats\n\n**General Tips**\n\n1. Make sure you're getting as much sleep as you possibly can. Seriously. Make an effort to sleep more. Simply training harder in the gym isn't going to yield results like just resting more does. \n\n2. Gaining weight helps... **A LOT!** (But not required) So yeah, if you want to get big and strong you've got to remember to do what makes that first part possible, which is eat. Set a bodyweight you want to bulk up to. Be it 10, 15, or 20 or more pounds above where you are now. And once you get there just stay there for a bit. This is the biggest error I see when guys and gals \"bulk.\" They get to their goal bulk weight and instantly start cutting. Don't do this! Get big and stay there a bit. Milk those gains for as long as you can. I suggest three months because in that span you could start and finish a pretty good training cycle that incorporates different training phases; hypertrophy and strength, for example. \n\nIf this was attempted during a cut it would be *significantly* more difficult. Once that training cycle is complete *then you have my permission to cut.* \n\n\n3. Use a program or at the very least a set of training principals that are easy to implement that help assure you make progress. [This is the gist of what I follow.](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-gzcl-method-simplified_13.html)\n\n**Specific Tips**\n\n**Bench Press**\n\nLots of volume! From what I've experienced training myself and others is that things like bench and overhead press require a bit more volume than what you would expect- or what common \"off-the-shelf\" programs have written. So if you're doing something like Starting Strength perhaps try to add three sets or so of bench at the end of your work out, maybe around 65% of the weight you used earlier that workout. \n\nDon't be afraid of using a variety of presses either! Close grip, incline, wide grip- you name it. Hell dips would be a great addition. Give it a shot. If it feels difficult, and isn't hurting you, chances are you can progressively load it or use it to help accumulate training volume. \n\nPractice with heavier weights more frequently as you get closer to your \"Test Day.\" This will help you get used to handling those \"scary\" weights more confidently. That confidence will go a long way- believe me. But know this is a double edge sword... too much handling of those heavy-ass-weights can really run you down and sideline your progress quick. \n\nJust be honest with yourself when it comes to your abilities to recover from this sort of thing. Otherwise you're shooting yourself in the foot. \n\nOne thing that *really* helped me with this on the bench is using a [Sling Shot.](http://www.howmuchyabench.net/) Seems gimmicky at first I 100% agree but [it has really helped my bench progress this last year.](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/07/how-sling-shot-saved-my-bench-press.html) If you've got one but don't know how to use it [I wrote up some stuff on ways that you can incorporate it into your training too!](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/07/saving-your-bench-with-sling-shot.html) This isn't required though. Just something I really enjoy using personally. \n\n*Get your arms BIGGER!* Seriously. Bigger arms = a bigger bench. I'm talking about both your biceps and triceps. (Triceps for obvious reasons.) \"Now WTF does biceps have to do with benching, Cody?!\" Great question Trevor, sit down. By making your biceps bigger you're going to make the elbow joint more stable. Additionally, a bigger biceps is likely a stronger one and a stronger biceps can *help control* the flexion (bendy) of the elbow. \n\nThis was my biggest problem for the longest time. The heavier weights would just **drop** on to me, practically speaking. So once I figured that piece out I set to get bigger and stronger arms. Now, I can control the descent of the bar pretty well. Especially with weights that would nearly kill me previous. \n\n*The control of the bar on the way down is imperative.* If it does not land in the right spot on your chest it is going to be that much more difficult to complete the lift. An inefficient \"landing zone\" means that by the time you get it 1/2 way up you're already out of gas. And then, since you think that's your \"weak point\" you start training that 1/2 way point... \n\nAnd then you make no progress at all because you incorrectly diagnosed the cause of the problem. *Control on the descent is key.* The bar should always touch in the same spot. If it doesn't, fix yourself. \n\nOk, enough about the bench. We can talk about that more in depth in the comments. \n\n**Deadlift**\n\nOk, about the deadlift. First, I'm a firm believer in not Deadlift-Shaming people. Not everyone pulls the same way. We were all born differently. So just find how you can pull best that doesn't hurt you and you can recover from most easily. Sumo, conventional, rounded upper back, whatever. \n\nA while ago I wrote [this article](http://www.schwarzenegger.com/fitness/post/six-years-to-six-hundred-pounds) on /u/GovSchwarzenegger 's website and the people here and in /r/weightroom really seemed to like it. \n\nArticle **TL;DR**: Interviews strong deadlifters. They give tips. I give tips too. \n\nFor a strong deadlift you'll first have to actually deadlift. Sure, you can probably get away with just a bunch of accessory movements but it's really going to help to *actually practice the lift you want to be good at!* \n\nNext, you're going to want to have a very strong back. My go-to is pull ups. Why? Cause they're easy to recover from. They're fun. And they train your lats like a mofuggah and those things are kind of a big deal. If you can't do pull ups now check out the Armstrong Pull up program, or, you can read these other thingys I wrote over at /r/weightroom: \n\n[Why you should be doing more pull ups](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/17sbvl/why_you_should_be_doing_more_pull_ups/)\n\n[Why you should be doing more pull ups 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/2ar2iy/why_you_should_be_doing_more_pull_ups_2/)\n\nAgain, I followed my own method when it comes to programming but the gist of it was something like this:\n\nSpend a few weeks working from a deficit of 1-3 inches. Practice some heavy pulls from that deficit. Easiest way to do this is to just stand on one plate or two while the bar rests on the floor. This makes it much more difficult breaking the bar off the floor and it also does a wonderful job of strengthening your back. \n\nThen I would do some more volume work from the floor. Just standard deadlifts here for reps. For me the weight on these was usually about 405 - 495 pounds. Five or less reps at a time here and around 5 or so sets. The fewer the reps per set you want to do the more weight you should be handling. Easy as that. \n\nThen, since I couldn't squat (cause knee owie) I didn't do Front Squats. Which is my go-to deadlift and squat accessory. \n\nWhat I did instead was just crush the living hell out of my back with a variety of rowing and pulling movements. Pull ups, rows, lat pull downs, you name it. These were all done in that 8 or more reps per set range of weight. Nothing too damn heavy here- you just got done pulling a ton of weight! Also, since I couldn't squat I would just crush my hamstrings too. \n\n*Oh the looks I got going back and forth from lat pull down to hamstring curl machine...*\n\nTrain with and without a belt too. Nothing makes your abs stronger than working some moderately heavy deadlifts without a belt. This helps you focus on proper bracing and breath control. Here's two excellent videos on that: \n\n[Chris Duffin is a gangster.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcY3YSW9vX4)\n\n[Chad Wesley Smith is literally a mastodon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G_ot0-98NU)\n\nIf you cannot brace and position yourself correctly before the start of the pull then it's going to be so much harder to get it off the ground. Remember the landing zone for bench? Yeah, this is like launching off an aircraft carrier. Position yourself properly and jettison that bar into orbit because you're about to rip that bar off the ground. \n\n**Summary**\n\nBulked up. Followed some very basic training principals. And BAMCIS! there's a PR. \n\nSeriously though, this is a wall of text so I'm ending it here. I know I barely scratched the surface on a lot of this so please dig through those links I dropped. Visit /r/weightroom it's a great resource in itself.

Most of us know that crunches are quite a bit too easy. The problem is, the intensity (load) of the exercise is quite low so it's not useful to maximize strength or hypertrophy of the abdominal muscles.\n\n* *Reverse* crunches, on the other hand, are quite a bit harder for the general population. This makes for a great progression especially if you\u2019re looking for a pure bodyweight exercise as no weights or equipment are needed. That way, you can build more core strength without wasting time with regular crunches that are often too easy!\n\nKey points for success:\n\n1. Watch [the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVVeZRlcuY4)\n\n2. At first, you may have to use momentum to lift the hips up initially, but even then, lower down slowly with control. You're going to eventually want to be able to lift your hips up without any momentum whatsoever. \n\n3. To make it harder, instead of doing it with the assistance of your fingertips, do it with your palms flat.\n\nHope that helps!

My first meal would not be until 1 PM and my last meal would end around 9 PM.  I worked out 3 days a week doing heavy compound lifts and filled the other days with rest or some light cardio (basketball, a short run, jump rope, etc; more on all this later on)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFirst things first: get a body fat scan. There are plenty of places or ways to do this. The one I highly recommend is called **[Dexafit](https://www.dexafit.com/services/dexa-scan)**. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis will run you about $150 ($90 if you can find a Groupon) and will be the most comprehensive body-scan available. It uses X-ray to determine your exact body fat % and breaks it down by body part as well. It will also tell you your bone density and visceral (organ) fat. It was an eye opening experience for me and also served for more accurate macro-breakdown (plus it gave my fat-ass way more motivation). \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSecond: determine if you want to lose weight or gain weight aka whether you want to cut or bulk. You will then use a macro calculator to determine what your macros will be for YOUR diet. I used the following website to calculate my macros based on my height, weight, and current body fat % (was at roughly ~30% when I started this).\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere are the two calculators I used:\n\n\n1.\thttp://www.lgmacros.com/standard-leangains-macro-calculator/#.WspHXsgh0go\n2.\thttps://sareyko.net/leancalc/#/g=male/a=NaN/w=NaN/h=NaN/b=NaN/m=1.2/r=-20/t=20/p=2.5/e=NaN\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe first one just has you enter your weight and the amount of protein per pound of body weight you want to eat. I used 1.3g/lb since I was cutting. Use this if you don\u2019t know your body fat %. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe second calculator is a little more comprehensive and you can choose if you want to eat at a certain deficit on rest days/training days. On that calculator, choose \u201csedentary\u201d for activity multiplier (unless you are constantly running around all day with your job) and for calorie split select \u201ccustom\u201d. **I did -40% on rest days and -10% on training days.** This is aggressive, but I was more concerned with losing weight all together as opposed to just fat. I used the results from both of these to choose my macros, which were as follows:\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAge: 26\n\n\n\n\nWeight: 159\n\n\n\n\nBody fat: 22.2%\n\n\n\n\nActivity level: Sedentary\n\n\n\n\nCalorie split: -40% rest days/-10% training days\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nI created my own spreadsheet to track my macros. I put in all the food items I\u2019d eat regularly and add new ones as needed. After a certain point, I ate the same thing every day. My average days were as follows:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Training days** (Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday): \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n1,846 calories/30g fat/203g carbs/191g protein\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**262g Kirkland egg whites** (262 cals, 0g carbs, 0g fat, 28.5g protein)\n\n\n\n\n**445g Goya black beans** (475 cals, 1.8g fat, 83.9g carbs, 29.2g protein)\n\n\n\n\n**255g Chipotle chicken** (410 cals, 15.9g fat, 0 g carbs, 72.9g protein)\n\n\n\n\n**300g Chipotle white rice** (563 cals, 10.7g fat, 107g carbs, 10.7g protein)\n\n\n\n\n**225g Fat-free Fage Greek yogurt** (129 cals, 0g fat, 8.9g carbs, 22.8g protein)\n\n\n\n\n**35g whey protein muscle milk** (130 cals, 1.5g fat, 3g carbs, 27g protein)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Rest days** (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday):\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n1,200 calories/36g fat/27g carbs/191g protein\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n**169g Kirkland egg whites** (92 cals, 0g fat, 0g carbs, 18.4 g protein)\n\n\n\n\n**302g Chipotle chicken** (485 cals, 18.9g fat, 0g carbs, 86.3g protein)\n\n\n\n\n**23g almonds** (139 cals, 12.3g fat, 4.1g carbs, 4.9g protein)\n\n\n\n\n**150g Daisy Cottage Cheese** (120 cals, 3.3g fat, 5.3g carbs, 17.3g protein)\n\n\n\n\n**367g Fat-free Fage Greek Yogurt** (210 cals, 0g fat, 14.6g carbs, 37.2g protein)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI dislike cooking and the time constraints of it, so my meals involve no cooking whatsoever. Plus, I get to eat Chipotle every single day and still comply with my diet. You\u2019re free to do whatever works for you. I spent about ~$100/week on food.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**HERE IS MY SPREADSHEET AND HOW TO USE IT:**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Macro spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14bMUZVEY2Onmfq9rLUYorfOzsUqm1O3arZBeIL-8ujA/edit?usp=sharing)**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI made this a shareable google doc so anyone can access it. First thing: copy the whole thing, paste it into your own google sheet/excel doc.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThen, add in your macros for training day and rest days. Put in the calories, fat, carbs, protein for each day.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAll the foods I ate are listed on there. I used the nutritional information from the label/company website/google to calculate everything by hand. Unlike MyFitnessPal or anything like that, all you do is measure the food you\u2019re eating **(IN GRAMS)** and put that into the \u201cquantity\u201d section and let the spreadsheet do the rest.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE A FOOD ITEM:**\n\n\n\n\nEasiest thing to do is just delete one of my items and replace it with your own\n\n\n\n\na.\tExample: change \u201cEggs; large Grade A; Publix\u201d to whatever you want\n\n\n\n\nb.\tIn cell **C4** change the **serving size** of the food you are eating (make sure its in grams). Look on label of food for info or google if need be\n\n\n\n\nc.\tIn cell **E4** change the \u201c70\u201d in the formula to the **calories** of the food you are eating (per serving size)\n\n\n\n\nd.\tIn cell **F4** change the \u201c5\u201d in the formula to the **fat** content of the food you are eating (per serving size)\n\n\n\n\ne.\tIn cell **G4** change the \u201c0\u201d in the formula to the **carb** content of the food you are eating (per serving size)\n\n\n\n\nf.\tIn cell **H4** change the \u201c6\u201d in the formula to the **protein** content of the food you are eating (per serving size)\n\n\n\n\ng.\tYou are good to go. There are enough entries that you should be able to edit them without having to add new cells, which becomes a bit confusing as far as the excel formula; if you NEED to add a cell:\n\n\n\n\nh.\tmake sure you click on \u201cinsert row\u201d\n\n\n\n\ni.\tThe formula is **=sum[(quantity x macro content)/serving size]**\n\n\n\n\nj.\tALWAYS MAKE SURE THE \u201cTOTAL\u201d COLUMN ADDS UP ALL YOUR CELLS IF YOU ADD ONE. ALWAYS BEST TO DOUBLE CHECK. CONSEQUENTLY, THE \u201cTOTALS\u201d (BOTTOM OF EACH MEAL) OF BREAKFAST, LUNCH, SNACK, DINNER SHOULD ALL ADD UP FOR THE \u201cDAILY TOTAL\u201d NUMBERS IN CELLS K3, L3, M3, N3. DM me for clarification!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI always keep my sheet in a google doc so I can access it on my phone if I\u2019m away from a computer. I typically figure out what I need to eat for the entire day before my first meal. It\u2019s easier to comply with the diet that way and eliminates any cravings (for the most part).\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs for working out, I did RPT (reverse pyramid training). The workout was taken from reddit user 31Minutes in an AMA he did about his success with the Lean Gains diet.  His workout was as follows:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**RPT Workout**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A: Back day**\n\n\n\n\nDeadlift\t2x3-5\n\n\n\n\nPress\t 2x6-8\n\n\n\n\nWeighted Chins\t2x4-6\n\n\n\n\nRows\t2x6-8\n\n\n\n\nClose grip Chins\t1x6-10\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**B: Chest Day**\n\n\n\n\nBench press\t2x6-8\n\n\n\n\nIncline DB bench\t2x6-8\n\n\n\n\nBarbell curls\t2x6-8\n\n\n\n\nTriceps extension\t2x6-8\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**C: Leg day**\n\n\n\n\nSquat or leg press\t2x6-8\n\n\n\n\nLeg curl\t2x6-8\n\n\n\n\nLeg extensions\t2x6-8\n\n\n\n\nCalves\t1x12-16\n\n\n\n\nCable crunches\t1x8-10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Your first set is always the heaviest.** Try and stay in the rep range.

About a year ago, I made a post of me deadlifting 315lbs @121lb bodyweight. I made the post because I was proud I finally hit 3 plates, only to have you inform me that I could set the Junior American record with the USPA! I competed later that summer and ended up setting the American record in the 123.5lb class for 18-19yr olds in all 3 lifts and total.\n\n\nAfter that I thought I was done with powerlifting, I took the following Fall semester off of lifting and restarted in the winter. My school started up a Powerlifting club that Spring and that peaked my interest again. I lifted with the club and at the school meet I pulled 170kg/375lbs. I looked into the USAPL this time since that's a tested, drug free federation (I am a drug-free lifter), and found that I could hold the American Open deadlift record (currently 165kg/363.75lbs) and also the World Junior IPF deadlift record (currently unattained, but requires at least 170kg to have record). In order to set these records I need to perform the lift at National and IPF(international) level meets.\n\n\nI competed at a local meet on Saturday in order to qualify me for Raw Nationals, which will than qualify me for the Arnold Sport (international IPF meet). I weighed in at 56.2kg/123.5 lbs.

I had to go off the diet early because my job was very physical and I started getting light headed daily. Over the following 7 months I rebuilt in preparation to get back on the diet. \n\nI'm male, 36, 6'5\", and started at 445 in December 2014. My weightloss milestone was 260 in June 2015. My rebuild put me at 275 in February 2016.\n\n**Weight Loss Diet:** \n\n- 130 calorie shakes (Rapid Fat Burning Program and First Step are the ones I was prescribed). \n- Normal people are supposed to do 5 per day, I was at 6 shakes or ~800 cal per day. \n- By the end I had been upped to 8 shakes and coconut water (~1200 cal per day) due to work.\n\n**Exercise:**\n\n- Work (8 miles of walking 3-5x per week)\n- 1 hour of cardio 3x per week\n- 30 minutes of weights 3x per week. \n\nI lost about 6 pounds per week on average, but my strength went down progressively as the diet went on. About 40 pounds of the loss had been muscle. Within 2 weeks of going back to solids and starting my maintenance diet, 10 pounds of water weight came back putting me at 270, and I began rebuilding my lost muscle. My weight did not change much, instead my muscle mass just sort of shifted. I lost some on my legs since I wasn't carrying 445 anymore, and regained some on my upper body.\n\n**Maintenance Diet:** \n\n- Bought a scale and weighed EVERYTHING.\n- MyFitnessPal is absolutely key.\n- 2500 calories and aimed for mid-to-low carbs. \n- I ate as little bread as possible (it triggers my baked goods addiction). \n- 165-200g protein per day (200 lbs lean mass x 0.82g per lb). \n- 4-5 servings of fruit and the same for vegetables. \n\nI went with yams/sweet potatoes, brown rice, and whole grain pasta for when I ate grains. I did not worry about the carbs in fruit - most are pretty good on the glycemic index and it would take around 40 peaches to hit the 2500 calorie mark, so I went with the \"I like fruit and it's filling so I'm going to eat a lot of it\" approach.\n\n**Weight Program:**\n\n3 sets of 5 reps for most of it. I changed to 12x3 every few months and tried to vary my exercises monthly. I know the mantra is 5x5 around here, but there's some evidence that the 4th and 5th set have severely diminishing returns and I needed my program to be short to keep myself on it early on.\n\nDay 1\n\n- 5x3 bench @ 225 lbs\n- 5x3 tri's (cable) @ 90\n- 5x3 wrist curls + finger curls (bar) @ 60 \n- 5x3 chest fly's @ 215\n- 5x3 skull crushers @ 80\n- 5x3 reverse grip wrist curls @ 60 \n\nDay 2\n\n- 5x3 Cable rows @ 280 lbs\n- 5x3 Preacher curls @ 85\n- 5x3 Lat pulldowns @ 130\n- 5x3 Hammer curls (dumbbells) @ 40 \n- 5x3 Back extensions @ 250 lbs\n\nDay 3\n\n- 5x3 Leg press @ 600 lbs\n- 5x3 Shoulder press @ 145\n- 10x3 Calf Raises (seated) @ 340 (it wouldn't hold any more plates)\n- 5x3 shrugs (bar) @ 405\n- 5x3 leg curls @ 220\n\nAnd finally the progress pics:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/PSvFJ \n\nThe last picture was 2 months ago at 275 lbs. \n\nThe last 2 months were rough and my weight fluctuated a lot both up and down (hit 300, then back down to 280, then 290, etc...), but I went back on the shakes recently and am on my way again. I'm currently about 275 with 26% body fat, and I want to reduce it further before I get the loose skin snipped.\n\nedit: I forgot to apostrophe.\n\nEdit 2: obligatory R.I.P. inbox.

I love this community and just know that no matter what holds you back in life you can get through it, one small step at a time. \n\nEdit: Wow, woke up the front page. You guys are the tits. I'm answering all the questions I can now. But since a lot of you guys are asking, no I wasn't wearing my seatbelt. I was completely sober driving down to help my grandmother out in Florida a few weeks after my grandfather had passed. I was driving on a two lane highway in Arcadia FL and for some reason took my belt off to grab something from the backseat probably forgetting to put it back on. I was going around a bend and all of a sudden I noticed that a white GMC was in the middle of the road and we were going to collide. I yanked the wheel right to avoid them (I was in an old range rover, so it was incredibly top heavy), and over corrected left. This caused my vehicle to tilt and begin to barrel roll that would have made peppy fucking proud. I didn't hit my head (that hard) during the ejection or landing so I remember being shot out, hitting the ground and laying there, and trying not to pass out as I laid there bleeding. A short while later the paramedic called a chopper in and said that they barely got to me in time, They flew me to a level 2 trauma center in Fort Meyers, FL where they proceeded to look at me, call my family, and basically ask them how fast they could drive down here because I didn't have much time and they wanted them to be able to say goodbye. I remember vague dreams of always fighting, never giving in to the pain because deep down inside I knew to quit was to die. I had punctured my left lung 3 times, My right 2 times, my spleen was taken out along with half my liver, and sustained cardiac arrest twice, once leaving my without a heartbeat for a minute and a half. I even fought so hard in the ICU that at one point in shock I ripped my chest tubes out (don't do that). The doctors to this day though say that because of my perseverance and fight is the reason I am alive to day.

I had tried lifting in college my sophomore and junior years but knew nothing at the time about diet or technique. I ended up injuring my back trying to lift WAY too heavy and stopped altogether. \n\nMy diet was horrible, and I did not exercise at all the next two years and pretty much ate everything and anything I wanted. I started to get chronic lower back pains and initially blamed my height for it. A year later and it was still a problem (even after stretching, doctors and chiropractor visits). I decided to start working out again to strengthen my lower back and to improve my overall physique. \n\n**Start of Calisthenics (5 months)**\n\nI started off doing calisthenics only. My work had an outside 'jungle gym' so I used this as my main workout area. \n\nMy workout consisted of mainly pull-ups, pushups, dips, and squats and was broken into a 4 day workout split. I did different variations of these main exercises with high intensity and very low rest time (30-45 seconds max). I usually did them circuit style and my workouts only lasted for 30 minutes (I did about 4-5 sets). But since it was such high intensity, my body/muscles grew a lot. \n\nI also coupled this with a high caloric diet (4000) and almost no cardio. I wanted to gain a lot of weight so I tried to retain as much calories as possible during my bulk. \n\n**Weightlifting**\n\nAfter my bulk, I managed to gain about 35lbs of muscle and fat (mostly fat) and weighed around 185lbs. It felt great knowing that I could actually put on weight! I made pretty decent gains with calisthenics, mostly because my weight kept increasing as well as the number of sets and reps I did. But after awhile I felt I needed a changed and started lifting weights. \nMy lifts are still centered around pullups, dips, pushups, and squats, except that I add weight to them (I started doing bench press and deadlifts as well). \n\n**Diet**\n\nI've cut back significantly on my calorie intake and now only eat around 2500 a day. I've also added back cardio into my workouts and run/sprint about 2-3 times a week. \n\n**Supplements**\n\nWhen I was bulking, I took creatine and protein powder. But as of know, I only take creatine. I feel my diet is solid enough to provide me enough protein for the day. \n\n**Sleep and Workout Schedule**\n\nI usually workout in the morning around 5:30am everyday because work takes up most of my day (9am-5pm), and I still wanted to have time to spend with my girlfriend (5pm - whenever she decides). I still got about 7-8 hours of sleep by sleeping around 10pm or 11pm. \n\nI used to hate waking up early, but now I love it. One of the benefits for me personally, is that everything after my workout is centered around rebuilding the muscles I just tore down. I'm a lot more conscious of what foods I eat and what my body needs in order to repair. Another benefit is most people aren't working out in the morning so the gym is empty. Whenever I try going to the gym after work, the amount of people there is crazy. It also really messes up my rest times and workouts altogether. But it is really just depends on your schedule and preferences. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSo far, this has been the longest I've ever stuck with anything in my life. The best thing is, my lower back no longer hurts! The biggest contribution I believe to my back no longer hurting is core workouts. Planks are a GODSEND. Do them for 10 minutes everyday (take as many rests as you need, but hold the plank for a total of 10 minutes) if you have lower back pain. I usually do them at the end of my workouts on leg days. They've helped a lot with my squats and deadlifts. \n\nOne of the most rewarding things that has come about this is that I was able to inspire people to workout. I've been religiously recording my progress and transformation over the past year on Facebook and created a  page to document my journey and share my experience. It's been working out amazingly well and I have managed to get 100,000 people like and follow my page. It's been an awesome year. I hope this inspired more people like myself to start lifting and to make a change.\n\nEDIT: Some of you have asked about my diet when I was bulking. I wrote a blog detailing it here: http://www.stikfitness.com/bulking-and-nutrition/. Thanks for all the nice PMs everyone and hope this helps.  \n\nEDIT2: I forgot to mention my present weight which is 168lbs at around 14% BF. I've been told it might be lower and more like 12% though. And yes, I am actually a 6'2 asian. I'm actually closer to 6'3, but here's a [picture](http://imgur.com/yoUf48M) I took back in September 2015. My girlfriend for scale (she is 5'0 tall). \n\nEDIT3: WOW. Thank you guys for all the upvotes. There's so many questions but I'll try to answer them all. One frequent question is about the planks and it helping my lower back. First I'd like to clarify and say that planks did not 'heal' my lower back pain. Second, I'm also not a licensed PT, so be sure to visit your doctor or therapist first to figure out what's wrong and why it hurts. I took a good amount of rest time (icing, staying in bed with feet elevated, massaging, etc) before I even attempted to do planks. I stretched my butt, hips, and lower back, but avoided any flexion stretching (i.e. touching toes), and started doing superman holds as well. After a few weeks when my lower back started to heal, then I started incorporating planks into my workout to strengthen the area to help prevent future injuries. \n\nEDIT4: I have never tried to lift my 1RM but here are my numbers for 3 reps: Dumbbell bench press (80lbs), Squat (225lb), Deadlift (305lb). I prefer and usually do dumbbell bench press since I workout alone and can push myself more without being afraid of getting stuck.\n\nEDIT5: Some of you have asked for my social media. Here's the link to my [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/theabenelson/) page and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aabenelson). I'm pretty active on social media so feel free to reach out to me there if you guys have any other questions about my progress.

If you lift hard and eat right, the muscles you work will get bigger. You do not need an anatomical guide. It will not make a single bit of difference in regards to your muscular development. If you're interested in learning more about the anatomy and biomechanics, the guy is basically just ripping off exrx.net and wikipedia, then adding some broscience stuff about lifting.\n>\n>Nobody needs these guides, they just think they do because the author is making it seem like he has a deep understanding and can give people ONE WEIRD TRICK to get more muscular.\n\nSimilarly, let me quote [Martin Berkhan](http://www.leangains.com/2011/09/fuckarounditis.html) on the topic of \"fuckarounditis\":\n\n> The Internet provides a rich soil for fuckarounditis to grow and take hold of the unsuspecting observer. Too much information, shit, clutter, woo-woo, noise, bullshit, loony toon theories, too many quacks, morons and people with good intentions giving you bad advice and uninformed answers. Ah yes, the information age.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> The problem at the core of the fuckarounditis epidemic is the overabundance of information we have available to us. If there are so many theories, articles and opinions on a topic, we perceive it as something complex, something hard to understand. An illusion of complexity is created.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> When it comes to strength training, the right choices are limited and uncomplicated. There are right and wrong ways to do things, not \"it depends\", not alternative theories based on new science that we need to investigate or try. Basic do's and don't's that never change. Unfortunately, these fundamental training principles are lost to many, and stumbling over them is like finding a needle in a haystack.\n\nOn the same topic [Stan Efferding](http://npcnewsonline.com/powerbuilding-you-dont-grow-in-the-gym/63930/) says:\n\n> It really is this simple:\n>\n> Lift heavy weights three times a week for an hour. Eat lots of food and sleep as much as you can.\n>\n> That\u2019s it. There\u2019s nothing more to add. I\u2019d love to be able to just stop there and trust that the person asking the question will do exactly those two things and get huge and strong.\n>\n> But, there\u2019s always a million nit picky questions to follow, the answers to which really make very little difference. \n\nAs a novice trainee, the one thing you do not need is additional complexity. You need to find a program created by someone who knows what they are doing **who has already taken this complexity into account** and follow it. With time, you may learn new things, and this is entirely fine, as long as it doesn't detract from the program you are following.\n\nThe most important thing you can do is to just train hard and well, and do it consistently. If you want to learn about the body check out [ExRx](http://www.exrx.net/Lists/Directory.html) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_system).\n\n**Edit:** There appears to be a massive misreading of the second sentence of this post ([see here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2zleuq/training_101_why_you_dont_need_anatomical_guides/cpkmz3x)).

Although the abs are a very important part of the core, they are not the only muscle that it is composed of.  The core is like a belt; it consists of muscles that are on the front, side, and back of your body.  This post will focus on these 3 muscles of the core (there are more involved, but I will focus on these for this post).\n\n>*[Rectus Abdominus](http://imgur.com/XqsCaTz) (Abs)*\n\n>* Originates/Starts on the [pubic crest](http://imgur.com/89mB7Am)\n     \n>* Inserts/Attaches on ribs 5-7 and the [xiphoid process](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Xiphoid_process_frontal.png) \n\n>*[External Obliques](http://imgur.com/49B1Fa4)* \n\n>* Originates on ribs 5-12\n\n>* Inserts on the [iliac crest](http://imgur.com/2QNdze6) \n\n>*[Erector Spinae](http://imgur.com/eLfUvvL)*\n\n>* The erector spinae are actually a few muscles grouped together \n     \n>* Originate on the [posterior portion of the iliac crest](http://www.newhealthguide.org/images/10448576/image001.jpg)\n     \n>* Inserts on the [T1 and T2 vertebrae](http://imgur.com/zdqYZyW) and the [cervical vertebrae](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Cervical_vertebrae_lateral2.png/1024px-Cervical_vertebrae_lateral2.png) \n\n>**FUNCTION**\n\n>The function of the core as a whole is to stabilize the spine. This is why core strength is imperative for athletic function.  When a [linebacker makes a tackle](http://unkantelope.com/wordpress_antelope/wp-content/gallery/sports/tackle_duden.jpg), he needs a strong core to ensure his lower back stays straight, like a pillar, in order to deliver maximum force.\n\n>Each muscle that makes up the core also has an individual role:\n\n>*Abs* \n\n>* The main function of the abs is to [flex the spine](http://assets3.tribesports.com/system/challenges/images/000/041/552/original/20130415212122-3-minute-mini-workout-for-7-days-crunches-squats-a.jpg) \n\n>* This muscle also compresses the abdomen (this is what you do when you brace for a punch to the stomach)\n\n>*Obliques*\n\n>* [Rotates the spine](http://www.kenaispine.com/assets/exercises/stand_rotation.jpg) \n\n>* [Laterally flexes the spine](http://www.masatenisi.org/images/stretch4.gif) \n\n>* Similar to the abs, the obliques flex the spine forwards as well\n\n>*Erector Spinae*\n\n>* [Extension of the spine](http://imgur.com/DoUQDle)\n\n>**DO YOU NEED TO DO DIRECT CORE WORK?**\n\n>Yes. You do. A lot of people don\u2019t do direct core work because they believe that squats and deadlifts will hit their core sufficiently.  This would be similar to not training biceps directly because they are hit during your back workout. While it is true that these exercises do involve a high level of core activation, direct work will be very beneficial, not only for aesthetic purposes, but also for strength.  Elite powerlifters and weightlifters squat and deadlift (or some variation of them) almost every single day, yet they still do direct core work.  [Here](https://youtu.be/EraSU_9X-XI?t=3m5s) is Konstantin Konstantinovs, an elitle powerlifter, training his core directly.  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdH8vIVFi4Q&spfreload=10) is Apti Aukhadov, an elite weightlifter, doing direct ab work. If these guys, who train for strength, feel the need to train their core, so should you.\n\n>**ABS TRAINING**\n \n>A common question that people have when it comes to training abs is \u201cHow can I bring up my lower abs?\u201d.  The scientific answer to this is that you can\u2019t.  The abs, both lower and upper, are one muscle.  Either the entire muscle contracts, or none of it contracts. \n\n>Visibility of abs is another very common concern.  Most of you have probably heard the following quote, \u201cAbs are made in the kitchen\u201d.  This has some truth to it. For your abs to be visible, you have to be at a certain body fat (usually below 10%). But that does not mean you shouldn\u2019t train your abs.  Just like any other muscle, the more you work your abs, the larger they will grow.  So by working your abs, you can increase the body fat percentage that it will take for them to be visible at (maybe instead of having to be at 10% to see your abs, you can be at 12% and see them).  \n\n>As I\u2019ve mentioned in previous 101 posts, to work a muscle optimally, you have to fully stretch a muscle, and then fully contract it. The abs are stretched when the spine is extended, and are flexed when the spine is flexed. \n\n>* [Crunches](https://youtu.be/1V4RXxLHNCY?t=1m52s) \n\n>* [Cable Crunches](https://youtu.be/h1nvxfWlWgM?t=1m53s) \n\n>* [Hanging Leg Raises](https://youtu.be/CRIDhu-Ylbk?t=1m30s) \n\n>Crunches are probably the most popular abs exercise there is, and rightfully so.  They are extremely effective and targeting the muscle. Doing crunches on the ground can limit the stretch you can achieve in your abs.  To combat this, it can be very beneficial to perform crunches on an exercise ball instead.  IFBB Pro Ben Pakulski demonstrates how he performs crunches on an exercise ball [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9WmOBRI54U&spfreload=10). \n\n>Cable crunches are another great exercise.  These are my personal favorite ab exercise.  What separates these from normal crunches is that you can use some heavier weights while doing these.  More weight has been shown to correlate with more muscle growth.  It is also very easy to get a great stretch and contraction with this variation of the crunch. \n\n>Hanging leg raises can be done in a number of different ways for people at different levels.  A beginner can do a variation such as [this](https://youtu.be/gtpfi4btmag?t=22s), whereas advanced individuals can do something like [this](https://youtu.be/RfgWnoPoo-o?t=37s). Progressions that people can use for these are: back support and knees to chest, back support and legs to chest, no back support and knees to chest, and then no back support and legs to chest.  \n\n>**OBLIQUES TRAINING**\n\n>These are the muscles that you want to train to get that [\u201cV\u201d muscle](http://www.peckmeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/obliques.jpg) people try to achieve. \n\n>* [Woodchoppers](https://youtu.be/pAplQXk3dkU?t=1m34s)\n\n>* [Side Crunches](https://youtu.be/jINgwwDTeOw?t=2m31s)\n\n>* [Side Bends](https://youtu.be/HCkte7H1hIc?t=33s) \n\n>Woodchoppers are a great exercise and target the obliques by utilizing their rotational function.  These also allow you to use heavier weights, which can be very beneficial to muscular growth. \n\n>Side crunches and side bends utilize the obliques through their side flexion function.  Side crunches are a really great way to really feel your obliques working, and are an exercise that allows you to maintain a high amount of control.\n\n>Keep in mind that the obliques also flex the spine forwards, so they will be used in all exercises that target the abs as well.\n\n>**ERECTOR SPINAE**\n\n>The erector spinae are a very powerful and important muscle.  The development of this muscle is extremely important for strength related sports, such as weightlifters, due to the fact that it plays a massive role in cleans and snatches, and also is very important for overhead movements.  The erector spinae are trained through extending the spine.\n\n>* [Hyperextensions](https://youtu.be/nuHJYKUapZw?t=31s) \n\n>* [Slow Negative Deadlifts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQnEVoRG9gw&spfreload=10) \n\n>* [Back Crunches](https://youtu.be/jINgwwDTeOw?t=6m26s) \n\n>Hyperextensions are an amazing way to strengthen your lower back. The video linked above for hyperextensions is an advanced version. These can be done with just your bodyweight, or by holding a plate to your chest. If you can get a barbell to your back, then you can mimic the video, but it is not essential to use a barbell. \n\n>Slow negative deadlifts are my favourite lower back exercise.  Try to make the negative portion last 5+ seconds, and your lower back will be on fire.  When you are lowering the weight at a slow rate, your erector spinae will be fighting like crazy to keep your spine from flexing/rounding.\n\n>**OVERALL CORE TRAINING**\n\n>Remember that the function of the core overall is to stabilize and keep the spine straight.  There are great exercises to target your core as a whole as well.\n\n>* [Stir the Pot](https://youtu.be/3EuMtm2MzRA?t=4s) \n\n>* [Ab Roll-Outs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA2QGI0NPWU&spfreload=10) \n\n>* [Planks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSHjTRCQxIw&spfreload=10) \n\n>* [Pallof Press](https://instagram.com/p/vEX4cuKEKR/)\n\n>All of the above exercises have one thing in common.  They strengthen the function of the core by requiring you to keep your spine straight and stable the entire time.  They have great carryover for both athletic and aesthetic purposes.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* The core is composed of many muscles \n\n* The core as a whole functions to stabilize the spine\n\n* Abs function is to flex the spine forwards\n\n* Obliques flex the spine forwards and laterally, and rotate the spine\n\n* Erector Spinae extend the spine\n\n* Direct ab work is very beneficial for all training purposes\n\n\n\n\n  ", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Core 101: An Anatomical Guide to Training", "post_ups": 3135, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/309ilj/core_101_an_anatomical_guide_to_training/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:11.988230", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "tykato", "post_created_utc": 1485690143.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1485761287.0, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "5qteyq", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 180, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3133, "post_selftext": "Hey /r/fitness,\n\ni've always wanted to be able to do the middle splits like Van Damme, but (no surprise) when i started training i was as flexible as a brick. About half a year ago, i decided that i still want to go and try to learn the middle splits and researched the internet for various middle splits routines. Since there's plenty on the internet with many different approaches, i put my own routine together. A portion of my routine consists of stretches that i learned from the [Focused Flexibility](http://www.gmb.io/ff/) program from Gold Medal Bodies. It's a full-body self-assessment program that shows you your flexibility weaknesses and makes you work on them on a day-to-day basis.\n\nHalf a year later, i've made [tremendous progress](http://imgur.com/a/BkluW) - i did this routine 3x a week.\n\nSo, instead of keeping this to myself i've made a follow-along video out of it, so you can try it out yourself and join me on getting those middle splits.\n\n***\n\n* Start all practice with the [Horse Stance](http://i.imgur.com/xz4gqH2.png). I prefer 30 seconds, but you can aim for a minute or longer. It's a wide squat position that really prepares your legs for the split position.\n\n* I continue with a [Hamstring Stretch](http://i.imgur.com/mCe8BI5.png) where i sit on my one leg and extend the other one in front of me. Now switch between dynamic contractions and static holds, while you lean forward. It's like PNF stretching where you switch between contracting and relaxing.\n\n* Third stretch is a [Kneeling Lunge](http://i.imgur.com/9qXYFhL.png), where you again dynamically contract and relax into the stretch. Get the angle between the front leg and the back leg wider while you relax. This also prepares you for the front splits.\n\n* Fourth exercise is a [Butterfly Stretch](http://i.imgur.com/jtXkx05.png), where you sit on the floor and place your feet against each other. Now you rotate your hips outside to get your knees to the floor. This stretches your adductors really good. You continue this, by afterwards laying on your back and extending one leg into the air. Now let it [rotate outside](http://i.imgur.com/EqzNim8.png) and hold it there - pulling it towards a split position.\n\n* Next exercise is the [Frogger Stretch](http://i.imgur.com/hE7hpXw.png), where you form a 90\u00b0 degree angle between hips and torso, and also between your legs and calves. Spread those hips on the floor and rock back and forth. With relaxation, you will be able to widen the stretch between your legs.\n\n* Last exercise are the [Middle Splits](http://i.imgur.com/CC1km1n.png) themself. You spread your legs and start to hold a comfortable, light stretching position for 30 to 60 seconds. Afterwards, you deepen the middle splits and repeat. Once you have done so, you hold the deepest you can go for 10 seconds (without support from your arms).\n\n* Done! You can repeat this routine every other day. Personally, I find that i need a day's rest afterwards. See the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyuBbYx28sg) for visible explanation of the exercises.\n\n***\n\nSo, i hope this will help some of you to get back to their dream of achieving the middle splits. I've got some questions aswell, to start a discussion and hear you guys' opinion on this:\n\n* If you got the middle splits already, how did you train for them?\n* Have you given up on learning the middle splits? If so, why? Do you want to start again?\n\n# Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyuBbYx28sg", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "I always wanted to learn middle splits like Van Damme, but i'm a really inflexible adult.

During my freshmen and sophomore years of college I was considered the \"hermit\" of the hall. I spent all of my free time playing online games and didn't do much socializing outside of what I did online. I was never depressed or felt bad about myself, quite the contraire I had and still have rather high self-esteem and I will always look back on my online experiences with a smile. But one day I just felt like I had been throwing the best years of my life away, seemed like I had been missing the college experience and I needed to do something so that I could enjoy my life as a young college student while I still could, I hadn't even kissed a girl at this point. Granted I still thoroughly enjoy playing online games but I felt like maybe I should make a change so I don't live with regret for the rest of my life, so I did. I still have a long ways to go, the end goal is the whole package, 6 pack/Adonis belt/nice arms/butt/etc all that jazz, but being a normal BMI for the first time in my life felt like a milestone, so I decided to share. \n\n**How did it start?** I had thought about losing weight for a rather long time, I just never felt like it could be accomplished easily, not to mention my entire family was overweight and I felt like I would be judged on my path to becoming a better me. Granted it originally was, losing weight was thrown around as a \"joke\" for about a week or two, but as I hit the gym literally every day they got far more serious and very supportive. But the major factor was that I managed to run into a girl online who was very supportive of me, she helped me start my journey (we had known each other about 3 weeks before I had actually started my weight loss). Thank you if you are reading this, I am forever indebted to you.\n\n**What I did to lose the weight:** It started very simple with no real set schedule, \"go to the gym and do cardio\" and it honestly hasn't really changed much. I still do not have set days in which I do certain exercises but I have managed to branch out into doing more upper body exercises and core, I still have completely disregarded my legs as it is very important that I am able to do cardio daily. At some point I do need to start doing real routines like squats/deadlifts/etc, but I'm still trying to lose some more weight before I make a change into the building muscle portion of my goal, not to mention I have no idea how to even start working on \"gains\". When I first started I felt like a fool, I would just use the treadmill in a gym packed full of good looking college students and just walk/run until I hit 500 calories. It felt embarrassing running my fat ass on a treadmill and it would often take over an hour but I always felt good afterwards so I continued to do it. I also started to track my calories as well as I could given my laziness, set the aggressive goal of 2lbs a week on myfitnesspal and never counted the calories burned at the gym as food I could eat, working out was simply a bonus or a padding for when I slipped. I wanted to lose a lot of weight, and I wanted to do it as fast as possible. I dropped 20lbs within the first month and hit my first plateau, this is when I made the first real change to the food I was eating to get back on track. I originally was still eating crap, just less of it. I made the move from the foods I enjoyed to mostly just chicken and some steamed vegetables to get over my hump, I still ate things I considered delicious here and there but my diet consisted mostly of cooked boneless skinless chicken breast often with a low calorie condiment. I was getting stronger and my heart was becoming more used to my routines, so every time something became too easy I made it difficult again. Went from 500 to 700 to 1000 to 1200 calories a day over the course of the next 4 months, just running and doing really heavy incline on the treadmill. This was supplemented with upper body weight machines and in the most recent month an ab routine that takes about 30 min. When I first started I was at the gym for nearly 3-4 hours a day, doing cardio and upper body and some days when I felt like I had slipped in terms of what I was eating I would go and commit seppuku the next day. Disciplining myself for being so lenient in my diet, I would be there for an entire afternoon, leave at 12pm-1pm and would return between 6pm-7pm. The one guy I do know personally at the gym from one of my university classes thinks I overwork myself sometimes, but I really wanted progress and I wanted it as fast as possible. \n\n\n**What I do now:** I honestly have slipped significantly in terms of my super aggressive routine, I'm still adhering to 2lbs a week, but that feels rather lackluster compared to the weight loss I was initially feeling. But I suppose it's acceptable as it does become harder to lose weight as you become thinner. For the last month I normally attend the gym 5-6 times a week for 2-3 hours, I take the weekends off typically to play an abnormal amount of online games and spend time with my newfound girlfriend since the gym times are not ideal for me on the weekends. For when I do go, I start with doing upper body for about an hour, normally the same core machines, bicep curl/chest press/tricep press/etc, I consider these rather relaxing and rather enjoyable. I currently abide by the \"stronglift\" style of doing 5x5 of rather heavy weights and pushing my upper body to near failure when I do them sometimes. Then every other day I do my ab routine, I used to do it daily but I'm at the point where I'm actually getting sore doing them and its very cool seeing the progress I'm making in that category so I do give myself a little time to heal now. Finally I do cardio for 800-1000 calories every time I go depending on how much time I've given myself before I need to be somewhere, normally takes about an hour and I do 95% of my cardio doing incline. Feels like low impact and I pour sweat, during the more intense presets on the treadmill my heart rate averages out at around 160 - 170 bpm according to the heart monitor on it. There are times where I just can't go on any further and I need to pull off the intensity, but I always keep myself above 140.\n\n\n**Major points:** It's not easy, there is no fast way, I'm very fortunate in my life to be able to work out so often to achieve my goals a little bit faster than normal. You need to find some sort of motivation to get yourself started, but you need to develop that into discipline to keep yourself going, even today I still don't want to go to the gym I would rather stay home and play games, but I'm not going to accomplish anything doing that in terms of my physical goals so I'm going regardless. Weight loss is also very very much so 80% diet 20% exercise, I'm currently eating around 1300 calories a day and every time I've plateaued or hit a rut is because I don't adhere to a strict diet. You have to eat better period, protein is king and starch/fiber foods are awesome. I still struggle with having hunger and I occasionally cave and dive into a delicious peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a glass of milk and a serving of chips, but seriously eating a plate of broccoli or a single potato with nothing on it makes hunger go away like magic. It might not taste the greatest but it will curb your thirst for food instantly. \n\nIf I can do it, you can do it, stop saying that you're going to do it someday and start now. If you want it bad enough you will make it happen. I can assure you looking back on everything I have done, it's definitely worth it and the progress feels great.\n\n**TLDR** Lots and lots of cardio, watched calories and tried to stay within 1300-1500 calories. Other than that, nothing was really structured and I just did whatever I felt like at the gym that day. Also apologies for the wall of text and no set daily routine, there wasn't any unfortunately, i just did cardio based on a calorie burned mentality.  \n\n**Edit 1** Thank you all for the supportive comments!!! Much appreciated, ill answer all the questions I can so ask away or PM me. Im also well aware that my hair this morning does look rather awful, i just have gotten lazy when it comes to grooming if I know im staying in today, outside of going to the gym.

I am by no means an expert (who is here, besides Phrak, really?) but having finished StrongLifts a couple weeks ago after roughly 11 months on it, I thought I could try to give back to the community, having leeched off of it for so long.*\n\n\n*This isn't gonna cover everything lifting-related. The [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/index) and [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/faq) is for that. These are supplemental StrongLift (SL)-specific tips for people who are just starting SL and have researched the programme already. The [website](http://stronglifts.com/5x5/) has a wealth of information - read it. You don't even need to download the \"guide\".*\n\n\n*The first 5 tips are cues for each lift which I found helpful. Before you skip over them, realise that the lifts* **are** *the programme. Sure it's important to understand the programming and the rationale behind SL but there's no point in continuing with it if you couldn't care less about form.*\n\n\nSo on to the advices:\n\n\n**1. Learn to deadlift properly.** [use these videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS2wLZSdeDg&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;list=PLbFxzzq99IUD1bxzKq7UUBI1TGjNSKUWB&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;index=1)\n\n* Stand with bar over your mid-foot.\n\n* Keep stance fairly narrow.\n\n* Keep your head neutral.\n\n* Bend knees until shins hit the bar.\n\n* Shoulder-blades should be directly above bar.\n\n* Hold the bar low in your hands, close to your fingers.\n\n* Keep hips relatively high - this is NOT a squat!\n\n* Lift your chest but DON'T squeeze your shoulder blades.\n\n* Get slack out of your arms.\n\n* Pull and keep bar close to your body. Dig heels into ground.\n\n* Think about pulling the bar back - NOT up.\n\n* Do NOT lean back at top/roll your shoulder back.\n\n* Pull quickly, even on warm-up sets.\n\n* Lower weight back down relatively quickly.\n\n\n**2. Learn to OHP properly.** [use this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqKhLR1zRaU)\n\n* Feet shoulder-width apart.\n\n* Grip bar just wider than your shoulders.\n\n* Hold bar close to your wrist (not close to your fingers). Keep wrist straight.\n\n* Elbows in front of bar but NOT upper-arms parallel with the floor. Elbows should not exceed a 45 degree angle out from your body (i.e. do not flare elbows).\n\n* Chest up and look forward - NOT up/down.\n\n* Once the bar reaches forehead level, shift torso forward.\n\n* Nicolas Cage the bar up.\n\n* Squeeze dat ass at the top and lock everything.\n\n\n**3. Learn to squat properly.** [use these videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ME8gEN54Ao&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;list=PLD7BE939BB32B4CAB&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;index=1)\n\n*Note: this describes a low bar (aka powerlifting style) squat, which SL calls for. It is generally safer than a high bar squat and offers better leverage, allowing you to lift more.*   \n\n* Tighten-upper back.\n\n* Make sure the bar is evenly spaced across your back.\n\n* Hands should be in line with forearms and NOT supporting the bar (i.e. keep thumbs over the bar).\n\n* Lift chest up and forward and keep it there (don't let it fall).\n\n* Keep shoulders back and down.\n\n* [Keep elbows down.](http://squatrx.blogspot.com/2010/02/elbow-positioning-when-squatting.html)\n\n* Head neutral.\n\n* [Keep bar low on back.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2tyOLvArw0)\n\n* Wide foot stance.\n\n* Keep knees out!\n\n* Keep weight on HEELS and mid foot (*curl toes if necessary to prevent putting weight on balls of feet*).\n\n* Always keep your back neutral or *slightly* curved (but NEVER rounded).\n\n* At the bottom of your squat, drive up with your ass! (Imagine a chain from the ceiling pulling lower back straight up).\n\n* Try to raise chest at same time (i.e. do not turn the lift into a [good-morning](http://firstpull.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/vap9o.jpg)).\n\n* Squeeze dat ass at the top.\n\n\n**4. Learn to bench press properly.** [use these videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHx1gYTA-Rw&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;list=PL38D8B0C3BFDB82F2&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;index=1)\n\n*Note: 95% of the bros in my gym don't bench like this and I don't understand why. The trainers in my gym call it the \"powerlifting style\" bench but I can't see how any other style would be beneficial.*\n\n* Forearms perpendicular to the floor when bar touches your chest.\n\n* Put the bar in your palm, close to your wrist (NOT close to fingers).\n\n* Tight upper-back.\n\n* Eyes directly under bar (when the bar is racked).\n\n* Chest up and big arch in back, but keeping ass on bench.\n\n* Weight should be on the traps.\n\n* Feet as far back as possible.\n\n* Knees should be lower than hips.\n\n* Keep legs tight.\n\n* Squeeze the bar (helped me a lot!).\n\n* Press in a straight line with elbows close to ribs (flaring is easier but will lead to injuries in the long-run).\n\n* Imagine breaking bar in half towards your feet.\n\n\n**5. Learn to row properly.** [use this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlRrIsoDpKg)\n\n* Row from the floor every time.\n\n* Keep bar very close to legs before pulling.\n\n* Grip the bar like you bench press (i.e. squeeze it).\n\n* Pull with your elbows.\n\n* Row against your chest.\n\n* Keep upper back parallel with floor.\n\n* Open your chest at top of movement (squeeze shoulder blades for a second).\n\n* Keep your head *down* (take this time to look for cracks in the floor from all the weight you've been throwing around).\n\n\n**6. Don't add weight too quickly.**    \nThe programme will seem easy at the start but the whole point is to perfect the form for each lift at a lower weight so you don't injure yourself at a higher one. Resist the temptation.    \nEDIT: To clarify, of course add weight every workout. But stick to the programme increments (2.5kg for everything except deadlift). If you've lifted before (and your form is great), you can start at 50% of your 5RM, but the increments should be the same as for beginners.\n\n\n**7. With that said, progress properly.**\n\n* Never lower weight DURING a workout, even if you only get 5/5/4/2/1 reps.\n\n* But do not increase the weight for the next workout if that happens (aim for 5 x 5 on same weight).\n\n* If you don't achieve 5x5 for a certain weight 3 times in a row then deload weight by 10%.\n\n* If you have to deload 2x on a lift, switch to SL 3x5.\n\n* If you have to deload 2x on a lift during 3x5, switch to SL 1x5.\n\n* If you have to deload 2x on a lift during 1x5, you're finished StrongLifts!\n\n\n**8. Warm-up properly.**    \nMehdi advocates SOLELY warming up with the lift itself but this is the one and only thing I disagree with about the whole programme. Learn to foam roll and do the [Limber 11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSSDLDhbacc) before every workout.    \nThen move on to warming up with the lifts.    \nEDIT: A lot of people are concerned about this point. I am not advocating static stretching (which has in fact been proven to *reduce* strength if done before training). The Limber 11 utilizes **dynamic stretches** which are very different.\n\n\n**9. Don't accessorize too early.**    \nIf you're going to add accessories, don't do it too early or you risk not being recovered in time for the next session. You're doing this programme for a reason - strength. I must confess I started adding dips/bicep charles in the last few weeks but only because most of my lifts were down to 1x5 so my workouts were short and my volume low.\n\n**10. Accessorize the right way.**    \nIf you do decide to add accessories anyway, here is what the original SL guide recommended:\n\nWorkout A\nSquat 5x5 \nBench Press 5x5 \nBarbell Row 5x5 \nDips 3xF\n\nWorkout B\nSquat 5x5 \nOverhead Press 5x5 \nDeadlift 1x5 \nPull-ups/Chinups 3xF (alternate between both types)\n\n\n**11. Do [these 5 stretches](http://bretcontreras.com/5-things-you-should-do-everyday/) on your off days.**\n\n\n**12. Don't be shy.**    \nIf you get unusually sore (DOMS is NOT unusual), try mobility work and stretching but most importantly - ask here (a video of your form is 1000 times better than trying to describe your problem in words). Or even better - get it looked at by a professional! My upper arm started to hurt a lot during squats. As an arrogant, overly-confident med student, I diagnosed it myself as bicep tendonitis. Turns out it was a rotator cuff issue, and I should have been icing in a different place all along. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/136g31/shoulder_stability_and_rotator_cuff_exercises_for/) Fittit thread helped immensely, as did changing grip, like in [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUTcYA9daoE) video.\n\n///////////////////////\n\n\n*Finally, stick with the programme - it works. You will go through cycles of hating and loving each exercise depending on what you're making progress in/plateauing in. Most important thing is that you love training as a whole and look forward to it. Find your \"why\" for training and never forget it.*\n\n*Regarding Mehdi's Inner Circle, I can't vouch for it as I never joined it. The community here is one of the best fitness resources on the internet, so I never felt there was a need to go somewhere else. I also wouldn't bother signing up for his emails. They get repetitive very early and are mostly advertising. With that said, I do feel Mehdi deserves something for all the inspiration and the information he provides. So if you have the money, it might be nice to [buy a month's membership](https://strongliftsinnercircle.com/join/) just to help the guy out.*\n\n*If anyone has any SL-RELATED questions (I'm not a doctor/qualified trainer) please ask. If anyone disagrees with any of the above points, please let me know. Particularly the form tips. I'm starting Madcow this week and would hate to think that I was still doing something wrong at this stage!*    \n\n*EDIT: Wow I got gold.

I know a lot of girls are scared of heavy lifting, and I wanted to share my experience because it's been the best thing for my health, self esteem and aesthetics and it's now not just my passion, but part of my life. \n\nI started getting into fitness the summer of 2012. I started off with typical 'girl' things like yoga, cardio etc. and I wasn't getting results. I lost a bit of weight, but that was mainly through diet. I started doing some research, reading r/fitness and decided to try out strength training. \n\nWhen I first put a barbell on my back to try to squat, it felt like the world was resting on my shoulders. It was ugly, but I kept at it. I started lifting once a week, then I started realizing that every time I went back, the weight that felt like the world last week, now felt manageable. I did some bastardized once a week version of 'starting stregnth', but I was still getting results. By the end of the summer I had dropped the excess weight that I had and decided to stop losing and start eating to gain muscle. Eventually I got more and more comfortable and started lifting twice a week, then three times. \n\nBy about november of 2012, I dedicated myself to strength training and dropped all the other 'crap'. My lifts kept flying up. By January, I started following the Texas Method program. \n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nMy lifts went from: \n\nSquat: 65lbs - > 185lbs \n\nBench: 45lbs - > 120lbs \n\nDeadlift: 65lbs - > 225lbs \n\n\nMy bodyweight went from 115 -> 98lbs (my lowest) -> 110lbs (now). \n\nI've been 5'2 this whole time. Wish that went up, but I'll take what I can get. \n\n--------------------------------------------------\nDiet:\n\nI forgot to add this in because I don't really follow much of one. I eat until I'm full and just get enough protein. The best thing I've learned in terms of diet is portion sizes and how to estimate calories. \n\nIt comes out to about 1500 cals rest day, 2000 cals training days now. \nWhen I was first losing weight, I was eating closer to 1200-1500 cals a day. \n\nSupplementation: \n\nI swig fish oil. And use some whey. I'm not a huge fan of stims, but I'll take some caffeine if I'm tired. Keeping it simple for now. \n\n--------------------------------------------------\nI've joined an olympic lifting team this month now following bulgarian methods and have switched my focus over from powerlifting, but it gave me the base strength and confidence I needed. I didn't turn into the hulk. I became strong.\n\n**Please ladies, please. Even if you don't want to be a powerlifter, get strong. Squatting 3x a week isn't going to kill you.** For the record, neither is squatting 5x a week.\n\nIf I could tell you one thing, it's that consistency will be what determines whether you succeed or fail. Push hard, don't be afraid to fail the weight and just keep at it. \n\nDon't overcomplicate things. Don't try to get everything perfect before you get in the gym. Just lift. And then lift a little more. It's simple, but it's not easy. \n\nThanks for reading! Let me know if you have any questions!

Some of you might remember my last progress post; you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/67pxj1/6_month_progress_125lbs147lbs/). \n\n**Background:** Not much has changed in the year. I was for the most part sedentary for all of high school, and wanted to get back into physical activities. Within this year, I've been playing in different intramural sports and I've looked to pick up Brazilian jiu jitsu (started 2 weeks ago).\n\n**Training:** Over these last 6 months I have been running n-suns 5/3/1 5 day routine. I started with the 4 day routine, but found i really wanted to increase my OHP as well as being a big fan of incline bench. My accessories are focused around a lot  forearm and grip work. Outside of the main tier lifts of the program, my most important exercise is weighted pull ups. I do a standard 5x5 3 days a week of weighted pull ups outside of squat and deadlift days. Lastly I workout on Saturday doing a light fun day of whatever I'm really feeling like, but mostly just hanging out on a stationary bike. \n\nNow for my actually main lifts I'll include my 6 month 1RM as reference:\n\n**Bench:** 65lbs ---> 135lbs  ---> 170lbs \n\n**Squat:** 65lbs ---> 225lbs  ---> 265lbs\n\n**Deadlift:** 135lb ---> 275lbs  ---> 345lbs\n\nSadly my squat and bench are really starting to fall behind my deadlift. Squats have never really felt that clean, but recently I've changed my stance up a little bit and it's started to really kick in. Benching I really don't know what I'm doing that wrong. I've been told by plenty of people that I should have a much heavy bench than I do. \n\n**Diet:** Now to the root of the problem. Over the first 6 months I gained 22lbs in 6 months so around 3 and a half pounds a month which I found a little slow, but almost perfect to being 1lb a week. Now over this last 6 months, I've only gained 8 pounds. I basically have been eating at maintenance on a bulk. I've really been beating myself up over not eating like I should have.At one point I had a 220 day streak of counting my calories, but that is now long gone. It just seemed like I hit 150lbs and eating in a surplus became impossible. I feel like I'm slipping back into my old habit of not eating, and I know i could have made a lot more gains if I ate like I should have. \n\nAgain I just want to say thank you guys for the nice words I read from my posts as well as other r/fitness threads. It's a fitness community you can't find anywhere else on the internet. \n  \n  \n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "M/18/5\"11, 125lbs-155lbs - 1 year progress", "post_ups": 3082, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/794wp9/m18511_125lbs155lbs_1_year_progress/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:11.988230", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "dipdipdata", "post_created_utc": 1400593676.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1400599269.0, "post_gilded": 7, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 7, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2612lv", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 968, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3075, "post_selftext": "*I'm replying to a thread and user that was deleted, I'm hoping they find this post, thank you.\n\nHey there, I just want to tell you that it's okay to feel the way you do.

One of them dubbed me Supermanlet, an epithet that I'm not sure I deserve but which filled me with pride. The overall appeal to my vanity got the best of me, so here I am with a frackin' novella about my progress.\n\n### Basic Stats\n\n|Topic              |Information|\n|:------------------|:----------|\n|Gender             |    Male   |\n|Current Age        |     29    |\n|Height |  5'4\"  |\n|Current weight |  129 lbs  |\n|Athletic Experience|I played the shit out of Epyx Winter Games on Commodore 64|\n|Lifting Experience |  2 years  |\n\n### Pictures\n\nI'll start with some pictures. There's a long-winded, rambling wall of text below, which I know most people don't want to read. Those that are interested will only be interested if the pictures pique their interest. So, pictures first.\n\n* **[June 2012 Gallery](http://imgur.com/a/irs7x)**: A handful of selfies I took for comparison one week before I joined the gym. This wasn't the start of my positive changes, but I consider it the starting point for when I got serious about making changes.\n* **[February 2013 Gallery](http://imgur.com/a/Yv14O)**: I didn't keep progress pics for the early months where the most drastic changes occurred, but I did take some in February. \n* **[June 2013 Gallery](http://imgur.com/a/dcX5J)**: Anniversary progress pics taken exactly one year after the June 2012 pics. \n* **[July 2014 Gallery](http://imgur.com/a/5TZFR)**: Pics taken this summer, showing two years of progress. \n* **[Year-by-year image](http://imgur.com/MU8UWyL)**: A side-by-side image, attempting to match the lighting and pose from last year \n* **[Clothes-on progress](http://imgur.com/a/iLCZI)**: Unfortunately, I can't just walk around shirtless everywhere I go. I'm forced to wear clothes that hide my progress. Here are a handful of pictures taken over the years to see what the change looks like with clothing over top of it. \n\nI'm somewhat of a smallfry at 5'4\". In the June 2012 pictures, I weighed 137 lbs. In June 2013, I weighed 122 lbs. My current weight is 129 lbs. I'm almost 100% certain that I'm the smallest guy I've seen at my gym.\n\n### Background and Personal Fitness History\n\nMy prior athletic experience is pretty much nil. I bowled until I was in grade 7, and lifted weights (machines only) for a few months in grade 9. I did track and field in high school because a girl I liked convinced me to join, but I performed terribly. Otherwise, nothing. My entire adult life has been spent hunched over computers and/or gaming tables. I've had some marathon gaming sessions, but even the *thought* of going for a run was nauseating.\n\nI've had body image issues at least as far back as third grade (my grade 3 teacher wrote in my record card that I had trouble with other kids making fun of me for being so skinny). When I got my first apartment at age 20, I weighed under 100 lbs - the literal 98-pound weakling of Charles Atlas fame. I wasn't anorexic, but I undoubtedly looked like I was. I resolved to gain some weight through a powerful diet plan called Eating Like a Lazy Bachelor. I adhered to this diet religiously from 2005 until 2011. This diet consisted of a steady stream of frozen pizzas and hot dogs, as well a delicacy of my own design: I would tear open croissants, and stuff them with peanut butter and shredded cheese. The diet had its perks, but somewhere along the line I forgot that I started eating like a pig to reach a reasonable BMI. By 2011, my weight was in the 150-155 lb range. That might not *sound* like much, but that was on a 5'4\" frame with narrow shoulders and waist, and only enough muscle mass to handle slouching in front of a computer all day. I went from being ashamed of my bony physique to being ashamed of what resembled a hairy, second trimester baby bump. Most people didn't think I looked overweight, which I attribute to an all-black wardrobe of oversized shirts hiding the baby bump, and my Riker hiding my lack of a jawline. Some co-workers thought it was a bad idea to lose weight because I was already \"so skinny.\" They hadn't seen me shirtless to learn the lumpy, skinnyfat truth.\n\nIn 2011, I started worrying about things from the health perspective, in addition to my already robust sense of aesthetic shame. I became troubled by how unfit I was, and how pathetically inadequate my body was for what should have been simple physical tasks. I started to question what I was doing to my life expectancy, and how young I would be before I could expect my first heart attack. This motivated me to make some small changes at first. I started to pack a lunch to work, instead of relying on Oh Henry bars and Doritos from the break room to tide me over until my Evening Gorge. I got an elliptical machine at home, but didn't really start to use it until I realized I could read my textbooks on it (I called this my educise). At first, it only took about 5 minutes at the lowest resistance setting to completely wipe me out.\n\nThe progress I made with such small changes was very encouraging, and in summer 2012 I had more spare time than I was used to, so I doubled down and got started for real. I fully committed myself to looking good naked.\n\n### Lift Progress\n\nI log my progress using Jefit for Android, and have done so since the beginning. All of the 1RM numbers below (aside from the StrStd screenshot) are taken from the 1RM calculator in Jefit based on my workout logs. I have never tested my 1RM for any exercise, and don't intend to. I'm in this mainly for aesthetics and a bit of general health; I'm not interested in powerlifting, so the weight on the bar is of secondary importance to me. I've changed programs and rep ranges a few times, so the calculated 1RM numbers swing on occasion. I also haven't been doing all of the barbell compounds for the full 2 years I've been lifting. \n\n|1RM (est)|June 2012 |  Nov 2012  |  July 2013 | July 2014  |\n|:--------|:--------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|\n|Squat    |    63    |     231    |    224     |    239     |\n|Bench    |          |     130    |    158     |    187     |\n|Deadlift |          |            |    239     |    320     |\n\nSquat numbers, aside from the most recent, should be taken with a grain of salt. My squat form has been inconsistent over time, and I've deloaded on several occasions to fix my depth. Unfortunately, my logs don't show when I was being a shithead doing partial reps.\n\n**[StrStd screenshot](http://imgur.com/OcUYG8y)**\n\nThe spreadsheet used to produce the graphs below can be [viewed on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Aob8UQ1p9l9ydE1IY1RySmk4RjB6QkZ2QVFvWlRORUE&gid=3)\n\nSquat\n\n * [Graph of squat progress over time](http://i.imgur.com/xSM9e7J.png)\n * I did squats in sets of 12 until December 2013, and for a long time my depth was terrible - so the lack of progress in the graph is misleading, as the early progress is basically just bad data.\n * This isn't going to be a popular opinion around here, but squats are the bane of my existence. I hate them *so much*. I never skip them, but I just absolutely fucking hate squats.\n * Squats are the only exercise that I worry about failing, and have never pushed myself to failure. By contrast, I bench to failure very regularly.\n * Sometimes it seems like every time I add a little weight, I take away a little depth. I was doing 4x5 at 225 lbs with questionable form in March, so in April I deloaded and switched to pause squats for a while to work on depth again. Currently, I squat 3x5 at 205 lbs. Depth is currently fine, but I still feel weak at the bottom, and haven't added any weight for more than a month.\n\nBench Press\n\n * [Graph of bench progress over time](http://i.imgur.com/pVpuZ0H.png)\n * I didn't do barbell bench presses for my first six months at the gym. I was actually a little bit scared of being under the bar, so I did dumbbell chest presses instead. That changed when I dropped a dumbbell on my chest, and decided I would rather have a bench with a rack and safety bar to rely on when I fail.\n * My bench press would not be accepted in competition, as I don't touch my chest and pause. This is due to a combination of an immovable safety bar on the bench, and a tiny chest; I have to take a painful back arch to get my chest above that safety bar. I bring my arms below parallel, which is good enough ROM for me.\n\nDeadlift\n\n * [Graph of deadlift progress over time](http://i.imgur.com/EGE5Dl3.png)\n * I started doing deadlifts in July 2013. Before that, I only did RDL's for higher reps.\n * I love deadlifts, but have been consistently frustrated by grip as a limiting factor. No matter how much grip training I do, my tiny little handlets can't hang on to the bar. After repeated grip failures attempting to hit 260x5, I thought I'd give hook grip a try, but found that my fingers aren't long enough for it. I finally decided it was time to buy straps. I've used them twice, and very much enjoyed an easy step up to 275x5.\n \nOverhead Press\n\n * I know that Fittit loves them, but I don't do barbell overhead presses. I stick to dumbbells for my shoulders. My gym only has one rack and not many barbells, so dumbbells are just easier to fit into my routine\n\nOther Lifts/Accessories\n\n * **Planks**: Planks are my absolute favourite ab exercise, and I've included some variation of the plank since I started in 2012. At the start, I struggled to hold a shaky plank for 90 seconds, with a pool of sweat forming on the mat under my face. Within a few months, I was able to hit seven minutes. I switched to the much more difficult RKC plank variation, then added weight when that wasn't enough. Currently I do three sets of RKC planks, held for 90 seconds with 35 lbs on my lower back.\n * **Dragon flags**:  Also awesome. First tried these in March 2013, and was only able to do 4 forced negatives. My current PR is 12 full reps (though the first rep off the bench is a bit shaky).\n * **L-Sits**: Started doing L-Sits on parallel bars just this past January. PR is 43 seconds (a failed attempt to hit 45).\n * **Pullups**: Jefit changed how assisted/unweighted/weighted pullups are recorded, so I don't have my oldest logs, but I think I remember struggling to do pullups with 70 or 80 lbs of assistance. I now use a dip belt to add weight, and my PR is 35 lbs for 8 reps.\n \n \n### Training Regimen\n\nI'll start with my current program, then give some of the history of my previous (occasionally questionable) routines.\n\nMy current routine (since the start of May) is based on Layne Norton's [PHAT](http://www.simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html) template. This is a five day routine, with two days lifting heavy for strength and power, and three days of bodybuilding-style training.  The most significant changes I made are as follows:\n\n* added deadlifts on the Lower Body Power day (Norton only includes one lower body compound on this day)\n* added ab exercises to both lower body days (because I love abs, and this gives extra incentive to not skip leg day)\n* added grip and forearm work on Chest and Arms Hypertrophy day (because I really need the grip work)\n* changed the order of many movements and added some supersets (because I can handle fatigue better and lift more with the changed order)\n* changed a handful of rep ranges from sets of 20 to sets of 15 (because sets of 20 are murder)\n* added some oblique exercises on 'rest' days (because I couldn't find time to fit obliques in elsewhere)\n\nThe full routine breaks down as follows\n\n**Monday:** Yoga, HIIT on rowing machine, obliques, and low intensity cardio  \n**Tuesday:** [Upper Body Power Day](http://i.imgur.com/wfyY48g.png)  \n**Wednesday:** [Lower Body Power Day](http://i.imgur.com/m5ztGrD.png)  \n**Thursday:** HIIT on rowing machine, obliques, low intensity cardio, and yoga  \n**Friday:** [Back and Shoulders Hypertrophy Day](http://i.imgur.com/68jaSMK.png)  \n**Saturday:** [Lower Body Hypertrophy Day](http://i.imgur.com/aZ5CnLn.png)  \n**Sunday:** [Chest and Arms Hypertrophy Day](http://i.imgur.com/cxb9sWh.png) (this lists both wrist roller and wrist curls - I do one or the other, not both)\n\nI've been extremely pleased with my results from this routine, especially in adding mass to my arms, which have always been too thin. I may have to scale back to a 4-day program in September due to schedule constraints, but I'll do everything I can to stick with the full 5-day split.\n\nI also do moderate intensity cardio on lifting days if there's enough time after the workout to grab a book and hop on a bike or elliptical before the gym closes.\n\nAll of my past routines included a *lot* of cardio in addition to the splits outlined below, usually targetting a heart rate around 155 (max heart rate 200). I do all of my reading on cardio machines, and I am an avid reader. I'm a part-time student that reads textbooks in full, in addition to my personal readings. I've spent close to 4 consecutive hours on an elliptical machine while reviewing a text for an exam.\n\n**June 2012 - July 2012 Routine**  \nFor my first six weeks, I worked with a personal trainer, following a Push-Pull-Legs split, with core exercises at the end of every workout. Fittit loves to hate on personal trainers, but while many of the trainers I've seen at Goodlife Fitness gyms have been rubbish, this was a positive experience for me. The trainer had some bodybuilding experience, and provided a lot of help in learning good form and balanced programming. I definitely got off to a better start than I otherwise would have without him - I would have educated myself eventually, but with the mindset I had at the time, I most likely would have ended up doing machines only with an over-emphasis on chest and arms.\n\n**August 2012 - February 2013**  \nMy grip started to falter towards the end of my Pull day (by the end of the workout I had a hard time closing my left hand), so I put together my own 4-day split to divvy up the pulls a bit more. I also alternated between a week focused more on free weights, and a week focused more on heavier weights with machines (though neither week was entirely free weight or entirely machine). My approach probably wasn't ideal, and it's certainly not what I'd do if I was starting over again.\n\n**Tuesday:** Arms  \n**Thursday:** Shoulders, Abs, a *little* chest  \n**Saturday:** Legs, Obliques  \n**Sunday:** Chest, Back, Abs  \n\nI made a lot of progress during this period, because Newb Gains, but it was undoubtedly the worst-programmed routine that I've followed.\n\n**March 2013 - August 2013; December 2013 - April 2014**  \nI became a Redditor in late 2012, and found Fittit some time after. I was looking for a new routine, so I looked at the Fittit FAQ for suggestions. I settled on a variant of the 4-day upper/lower split [Muscle Building Workout Routine](http://www.aworkoutroutine.com/the-muscle-building-workout-routine/), with the addition of ab work on lower body days. This routine worked very well for me. There was a stretch from the start of September until Xmas when I didn't have time to lift, but otherwise I stuck with it until I switched to PHAT in May of this year.\n\nThis was also when I completely overhauled my wardrobe and started dressing like a normal person, instead of hiding my physique under a mass of baggy black clothes.\n\n### Body Progress\n\nThe pictures above should explain my body progress pretty well. The biggest change was clearly in the first year. The second year handed me a considerable setback that I had to dig out of. For over three months at the end of 2013, I simply didn't have the time to lift weights at all. I adjusted my diet for the reduced activity, but failed to track my weight to gauge whether I set my calorie budget correctly. Apparently I did not, and ended up losing about 6 lbs. I spent a large chunk of the winter recovering lost progress. I had a lot of all-nighters and nights with only an hour or two of sleep over those months, and lack of rest probably slowed my progress further. I was able to add some mass before it was time to cut for the summer, but well short of my target.\n\nSince my initial fat loss, my body weight peaked at about 132 lbs this May. Since then, I cut slightly down to 129 lbs. I've been maintaining that weight for the summer, and have managed to very slightly drop body fat percentage while holding total mass steady. I'll refocus on gaining mass again soon. I don't like to call it bulking, because I prefer to gain in a very slow, controlled manner to minimize fat gain.\n\nI am nothing if not methodical, so I weigh myself and check my body fat percentage (using a handheld BIA device) first thing every morning. That data is recorded to make sure it's trending in the right direction.\n\nSome graphs showing the moving average of those measurements:  \n* [Graph of mass and lean mass over time](http://i.imgur.com/AZPzcAn.png)  \n* [Graph of body fat percentage over time](http://i.imgur.com/UWZxlCj.png)  \n* [Spreadsheet of recoreded measurements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Aob8UQ1p9l9ydE1IY1RySmk4RjB6QkZ2QVFvWlRORUE&gid=0)\n\n### Diet\n\nI set a calorie budget. Currently it's set at 2800 calories/day to maintain (or very, very slowly cut). I originally tried to set my calorie budget by tracking my activity (including wearing a heart-rate monitor), but that never produced good results. My best results come from adjusting the budget according to the trend it produces in my daily weight measurements. I log everything that I eat, aside from some spices and seasoning that have no or negligible caloric and macronutrient content. I've used a couple different apps for this, but the one I stuck with is [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) for Android.\n\nI allow myself a maximum of one dietary cheat day per week. In practice, my cheat days still hit my calorie and macro targets for the day, but hit them with less healthy foods (like Hamburger Helper); the weekly cheat days are just a chance to ignore things like fiber and micronutrient content. Cheat days that disregard my calorie target are very rare. I can remember only three occasions in 2014, one of which was due to a hurricane.\n\nI treat my dietary goals as commandments from up on high. I follow them as if Gandalf told me the safety of the One Ring depended on it. This is a [graph of my daily calorie intake](http://i.imgur.com/wyjD1LR.png) over a 90 day period to show the level of consistency that I maintain. I measure servings with a kitchen scale or measuring cup. I don't eyeball or estimate serving sizes (with the exception of peanut butter, because I've measured it so many times already). I adamantly refuse to eat *anything* if I don't have nutritional data for it.\n\n\n * **Macro split:** I set a minimum of 1g protein and 0.5g of fat per pound of body mass per day, just because they're easy numbers to work with. Other than those minimums, I pay no heed to my macro distribution. I find that a very high protein diet (close to 1.5g/lb or more) helps with satiety and makes it easier to avoid exceeding my calorie budget, but I don't treat that as a rule.\n \n * **Meal timing:** Irrelevant. I avoid having a full stomach during intense workouts, and avoid workouts when I'm starving. Otherwise, I eat when I'm hungry.\n \n * **Supplements used:** Protein shake with breakfast, made with almond milk, one scoop of Optimum Nutrition whey, and one scoop of creatine monohydrate. No other supplements related specifically to workouts. I take multivitamins to avoid potential gaps in my micros, fish oil for [general health benefits](http://examine.com/supplements/Fish+Oil/), and probiotics to avoid the flatulence that my diet otherwise produces.\n\n * **Snacks:** Apples, bananas, Kashi granola bars, and Quest protein bars are my main snack items. Sometimes beef jerky, if I'm patient enough to measure servings. I rely heavily on dry roasted almonds and sunflower seeds as end-of-day snacks to hit my daily target; my meals get me close to the target, then I measure out enough nuts or seeds to bring me within 3 calories of the target.\n \n * **Snacks:** Water. Lots of water. Aside from my morning protein shake, I drink nothing but filtered tap water (filtered so as not to sap and impurify all of my precious bodily fluids).\n\n**Common meals**: My diet doesn't vary much from day to day, and there are some things that are pretty much constant every day.\n\n* Weekday breakfast: Protein shake, Kashi granola bar; 330 cal, 31g protein, 8g fat, 29g carbs, 4g fiber\n* Weekday lunch: 200g grilled chicken breast, 500g raw baby carrots, 2 medium bananas, 1 large or 2 small apples, 1 Kashi granola bar, 1 serving of All-Bran Buds with a butterscotch pudding cup; 1191 cal, 37g protein, 20g fat, 188g carbs, 37g fiber\n* Weekend breakfast: Protein shake, bagel with natural peanut butter (12 whole grain bagel), 1 medium banana, 1 serving All-Bran Buds with butterscotch pudding cup; 805 cal, 43g protein, 19g fat, 123g carbs, 22g fiber\n\nAnd one of my favourites that I don't eat daily, but often enough to consider it a cornerstone of my diet:  \n\n* Hamburger: 2 lean beaf patties (I buy pre-made PC Blue Menu) on a thin whole grain bun, natural peanut butter, Montreal steak spice, 1 slice of mozza cheese; 670 cal, 64g protein, 27g fat, 39g carbs, 7g fiber (less if you skip the cheese or PB). Seriously though, whether you're dieting or not, hamburgers need to be doubled up, two patties per bun. It's the only way to eat hamburgers.\n\n\n### Personal Challenges\n\nMy greatest challenge has always been a lack of free time and its corollary, a lack of sleep. I have my full-time day job; I've been working to get a better degree for myself, and as far as student commitments go, *I am fucking hardcore*; I've carefully maintained a course-load that my university considers to be part-time while the government considers me to be a full-time student; I also do part-time consulting work, and the workload for that can vary considerably. All of that adds up to a lot of demands on my time, and not much opportunity to get sleep.\n\nI never set out to specifically track my sleep, but I use [Sleep as Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep&hl=en) for my alarm clock, and it just so happens to log me sleeping hours and produce [pretty graphs](http://i.imgur.com/x7IBAf6.png). Since I started using the app last year, I've averaged 6.08 hours in bed per night. That's less than ideal, but the bigger problem is how erratic my sleep schedule sometimes is. The deep dips on that graph are nights that I never got to bed, or only got to bed for a couple hours. There are also occasional days where I absolutely crash and sleep for 16 hours or more. I do *not* have healthy sleeping habits, and I'm quite positive that the all-night work sessions are stealing my gains.\n\n### Future Goals\nI look good naked, but still want to look *better* naked. I'd say that [Steve Cook](https://www.google.ca/search?q=Steve+Cook&es_sm=93&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=H-TjU9SLAdOUyASf_oCgDw&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1821&bih=902&dpr=0.75) has my [goal physique](http://38.media.tumblr.com/869ec0d0186d6630b6a856e7eb45ef1b/tumblr_n0y8rqGYs51tpda49o1_500.jpg). I'd like to gain about 20 pounds from my current weight while keeping my body fat percentage as low as it is now. Realistically, I think I should be able to gain 10 lbs per year, so another two years could take me there. Then again, I think I've always been aiming for an extra 20 pounds, so maybe I'm eternally cursed to forever want to weigh 20 lbs more. \n\nI don't have many specific goals in mind for lifts. I'd like to be able to bench 2 plates for 5 reps eventually, but at my size, I don't anticipate that happening for quite some time. Now that I'm using straps and don't have my grip holding me back on deadlifts, I'm hoping I can manage to get up to 315x5 before Xmas.\n\n### Other Random Comments\n\n* I wear gloves on all of my pushes and pulls except for deadlifts and barbell rows. I like to keep my hands soft and girly, and there's nothing wrong with that. You don't have to tell me that the gloves should match my purse. I think I've already heard that joke from every person who's ever heard Rip say it. Either say something original, or shut up about it.\n* I'm OK with any and all questions in this thread, so long as the mods are. Worst case scenario is that I'll ignore comments that I don't like.\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions (and Comments)\n\n**Question:** How do you keep your calorie counts so consistent?  \n**Answer:** With nuts, seeds, and a kitchen scale. I eat meals to get *close* to my calorie goal, without going over. Then I measure enough nuts or seeds at the end of the day to cover the remaining calories. My food diary for most days will show something like 8g almonds, or 32g sunflower seeds, etc. 1g is 5.8 calories, which lets me get within 3 calories (+/-) of my goal.\n\n**Comment:** Several comments about 'manlet' being a dehumanizing term, sexist, showing a lack of respect, etc.\n\n**Answer:** I understand the viewpoint, but I disagree. Tyrion is more eloquent than me, so I'll let him explain why:\n\n> Let me give you some advice bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. **Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you**.\n\nThe word has no connotations other than that which we give it. The LGBT community seems to have reclaimed the word *queer* as a positive term, so why the hell can't short guys reclaim manlet? That's what the Supermanlet moniker is to me. I can cringe at the word 'manlet', I can complain about people using it, or I can take the word, and make it my bitch. I choose the latter.\n\n**Question:** Do I recommend a program like PHAT as a starting point?\n\n**Answer:** No, I don't. Today, I live to work out, and hitting the gym is the high point of many of my days. If I tried to do high volume lifting 5 days a week, and cardio 2 *before* I developed that passion, I probably would have burned out and given up.\n\nIt's a generic Fittit answer, but my recommendation for a beginner is to follow StrongLifts until you exhaust your linear gains. After you've done that, and are positive that you'll carry through, then consider whether or not programs like PHAT are right for you.\n\n**Question:** Lots of people wondering about the impact fitness has had on my romantic life and sex life.\n\n**Answer:** So far, women haven't been throwing themselves at me, and I honestly don't have the time or energy to put into initiating such pursuits myself. I have noticed people of both genders being generally more friendly, and more likely to smile or say hi in passing, and less likely to react negatively when I do the same. That probably has as much or more to do with the confidence that comes with fitness, and possibly also my better attire.\n\n**Question:** How many calories did I eat during the initial fat loss, and how long did it take to lose the gut?\n\n**Answer:** I wasn't using MFP yet at the time, so I don't have a food diary that far back to verify, and my calorie target at the time varied from day to day depending on my activity for the day. I'm pretty sure that I was generally in the 1800-2200 range on most days. I cut from 137 down to 122 by September. Immediately after that, I accidentally cut an extra 4 pounds down to 118 by getting sick for two weeks.\n\n**Question:** People are curious about body hair.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, I manscape. I just like the look of it more. I use an electric trimmer. If it looks waxed or shaved, that's just a problem with image quality. I set the blade guard on my trimmer 1mm shorter for my body hair than I do for my beard.\n\n**Further to the topic of my beard:** My Riker stays. I know most women don't like it, but their aesthetic preferences are secondary to my own. I like my beard, and plan on keeping it. The beardly naysayers here are like Delilahs to my Samson.\n\n**Comments:** People suggesting I'm on steroids or prohormones, and specifically mentioning the back acne.\n\n**Answer:** No. I use no supplements other than those I mentioned in the OP. The back acne has been present since my early to mid teens, and is not a result of using gear. It's more visible in the newer pictures than the old due to the lighting and the post-workout skin inflammation in the locker room selfies.\n\nI've gained less than 10 pounds of muscle in two years of training. If you think that's indicative of steroid use, then I don't think you have a great understanding of what results natty or geared lifters should expect.\n\n### About This Progress Post Format\n\nCreated using [the reddit fitness progress tracking post template](https://github.com/cjbarber/FitnessProgressPosts).\n\n**Edit:** Added an FAQ for stuff that's come up in comments and PM's.  \n**Edit 2:** Updated FAQ  \n**Edit 3:** Updated FAQ again  ", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "[Progress] M/29/5'4\", from skinnyfat to aspiring Supermanlet", "post_ups": 3071, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2cz87v/progress_m2954_from_skinnyfat_to_aspiring/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:11.988230", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "lerkess", "post_created_utc": 1429621462.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1429675579.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "33cltu", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 1030, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3052, "post_selftext": "Recorded an average Monday at a FedEx ground facility with my Fitbit. \nhttp://imgur.com/6voGT0p\n\n\nEdit: Holy Stromboli this blew up. \n\nSome comments/context:\n\n1) Lots of people saying the Fitbit is inaccurate.

I set the machine to 4 and start jogging. I get to a minute and decide to keep going. I end up jogging for 30 minutes and I find this pretty shocking but I figure I've been accidentally training for it.\n\nI started a pretty physical job about two weeks ago. I wear heavy steel toed boots all day. There is a 15 minute walk from the parking area to the time clock. Twice a day i have to go up and down this killer set of steps. There is also a fair amount of random climbing, stooping, etc. Last Wednesday i also started riding my bike to work. That's because last Tuesday the auto shop  told me there's some dangerous and expensive things going wrong with my car. So i bought  a  bike. So I've ridden for 45 minutes twice  a day for four days so far.  Doesn't seem like enough to allow me to run 2.5 miles without difficulty but I guess it adds up. \n\nThe funniest part is, I've been thinking of trying a couch to 5K program for awhile now. Somehow, I've reached my goal without even realizing I finally started working on it. I know i only ran 2.5 miles but i could have easily done three miles. I got off the treadmill because the gym was closing and i still had to shower. \n\nUpdate:  Dem typos!!  Went back to the gym this Sunday and jogged 3.11 miles.  Woo Hoo!!!  Also, I did not itch at any time during this jog.  Amazing!  Amiracle!!  I think it's because I took a 45 minute fitness class before I hit the treadmill.  My capillaries were already warmed up and so could not torture me 10 minutes into my jog.  It took me 20 years to figure out how to get rid of that itch!!!

 \nfirst of all, thanks for all the info and experience you're sharing.\nwithout further ado, before/after pics!  \n&nbsp;\n\n[before](https://i.imgur.com/oq7sjsF.jpg)  \n[now](https://i.imgur.com/ygPi14X.jpg)  \n&nbsp;\n\n# little background history.  \nM/ 35/ 5'8\"/ 154lbs (177cm/70kg).  \ni was that kid that never plays any sports in the yard, then no sports in the school (i even had a special certificate for that, even not having any health problems), and then same kind of certificate at the university. and i thought that was okay, why bother. \nsoon i turned into the *before* person, not even noticing that. life was good. i guess i would stay the same (or even worse), but one of my musical idols made a [drastic change](https://s00.yaplakal.com/pics/pics_original/0/0/9/523900.gif) and, to be honest, this was my stimulus. and i joined a gym!  \ni had no idea what to do at that time, personal trainers cost a fortune and i couldn't afford one so for ~year i was doing the pretty common *fsckarounditis*.  \nthen, i found this subreddit (hurray!).  \nat that time the SS and GSLP were trendy on here, i picked [Phrak's](http://i.imgur.com/0uiw7qW.png) variant and was happy about it.  \nwhat i didn't realized back then is the *nutrition* part. thus, i completely failed *again* reaching my goal. even more, i was following some advice to start with a bulk to make a frame so i ended even in worse state. damn!  \ninteresting enough things turned around after i got married (usually it's the oppositve, at least looking at my friends and relatives). in my case, i got lucky as my wife has a part time of personal trainer, so she knows her stuff. from this point things took a new turn (~10% bodyfat for the first time in my life, for example).  \n&nbsp;\n# Nutrition  \nThis became the collar of my next chapter in life.  \n* calculated my cutting calories,  \n* my macros,  \n* changed the food i was eating,  \n* started skipping the breakfast,  \n* incorporated veggies and souces,  \n* diet cola (amazing stuff)  \n\nand things started to happen. i am tracking my intake at least 5 days a week. weekend a kinda hard to operate, because going out or, even more uncontrollable, visiting parents. because you just cannot say NO to your mother when it comes to food))  anyhow, these days i am trying to take only lean protein sources at home, thus leaving space for the carbs and fats i will get later out.  \n[weight loss for the last 3 months](https://i.imgur.com/Fjts5ja.jpg)  \n[daily macros](https://i.imgur.com/kwvpPXT.jpg) (175 protein, 195 carbs, 30 fat for a total of ~1700kcal)  \n&nbsp;\n# Training  \nI am a office worker and lucky enough that my work starts at ~11-12 in the morning, thus i am attending gym 5 times a week at ~930AM, when i'm driving to the office. i do enjoy this way better than 3 day at week. it soon became for me a usual daily routine.  \nget up, espresso, drive to gym, workout, drive to office, do your job.  \nregarding training i am working out in the *RPT* style  \n* starting with my heavy set in 4-6 range  \n* then -10% of load, doing an extra 1-2 reps,  \n* then -10% of load, doing an extra 1-2 reps, usually AMRAP.  \n    \nwhen i can do 6 reps in the first set, i add weight and start at 4 reps and so on.  \nmy routine looks like:  \nMonday: Chest/Abs (Incline BP)  \nTuesday: Back/Calves (Deadlift)  \nWednesday: Shoulders/Abs (Military Press)  \nThursday: Legs/Calves (Squat)  \nFriday: Upper Body/Abs (Incline BP 8-10 reps)  \n&nbsp;\n# Pre- and Post-Workout meals\nHere pretty simple. if i train fasted (what i do 99% of the time), as pre workout there is caffeine (as one espresso and 100mg caffeine pill) and yohimbe + leucine.  \npost-workout 40g protein + 70g carbs in a shake (whey, milk 0%, a banana and oats).  \n&nbsp;\n# Supplements  \ninterestingly, i thought at the beginning these are some kind of miracle and using them i can achieve it all faster.  \ntried:  \n* beta-alanine  \n* vitamin d3  \n* leucine  \n* bcaa  \n* citrulline malate  \n* betaine  \n* creatine  \n* spirulina  \n* omega 3  \n* yohimbe  \n* whey (read food, as it is food)  \n  \nat the moment from this stack taking vitamin d3, creatine 5g a day, spirulina 3g a day, omega 3 (2g as omega itself), yohimbe 16mg + 5g leucine before fasted training.  \n&nbsp;\n# Cardio  \nwhen i reached ~14-15% bodyfat, the fatloss rate started stalling, i had two choices: cut calories more or add cardio.  \ni chose second, as 1700 is already pretty low, so on my rest days i am doing 20 minutes HIIT: 10 rounds of springs - 1 minute full speed, 1:30 minute at less speed.  \nfatloss went thru well with this.  \n&nbsp;\n# Preliminary Conclusions\nnow that my cutting phase is over, what have i learnt:  \n1. chose a fatloss rate of ~1% of your bodyweigh a week, because it's managable and you less face cravings and such things  \n2. implement a *refeed* day. your current cutting calories * 30%. add carbs to this amount and try having fat at ~20-25g on this day. you may think it hinders your fatloss progress, but it's not.  \n3. implement diet breaks if your cutting lasts longer than 3 months. take a week at maintenence every 3 months of cutting. it will do you good.  \n4. have a deload training week every 8 weeks of heavy training. it's your usual routine, but at 50% of your working weights. give your body some rest.\n5. don't engage in a diet that you know for sure you can't sustain in long term.  just eat *less*. the universal rule *calories in <  calories used* is working perfectly.  \n  \n\n# Next Chapter  \nNow i am taking 2 weeks of maintenence (upping from 1700 to ~2000kcals/day), monitoring my weight and finding my real number and afterwards will engage in my first ever bulk, aiming for a 2-3lb/month weight gain, hoping most of this being muscle tissue.  \n&nbsp;\nsee you when my bulk ends!  \nIF any questions - please comment.  \nIF any advice - please comment.  \n&nbsp;  \n# Edits:  \n1. first off all - **thank you for all the comments, advice, and congrats.** pretty flattering to be honest.  \n2. confusion about my height. i am 177cm, so google tells me i'm 5.8 feet (?)  \n3. diet cola thing: when you're cutting you want to eat. sometimes smth sweet, sometime just eat. drink diet (zero) cola. it is sweet and pretty fulling so it's a win-win. at least for me it was a saver.  \n4. about my **meals**. my daily meal looks kinda identical for the working week, this is a typical meal (1700-1800kcal):  \ni train fasted in the morning, at 930AM.  just an espresso (and 4g Leucine). 0kcals, but technically  20kcals  \nat ~11AM have a post-workout meal (40g protein, 80g carbs) - 550kcals  \nat ~130PM have first part of my lunch (chicken breast with veggies) 300kcals  \nat ~3PM a snack ~100kcal  \nat 500PM second part of that lunch (i divide it in 2) 300kcals  \nat 730PM pasta with pesto alla genovese (damn goood!), a flatwhite with 160g milk, some potatos 450kcals  \nat 1030PM cottage chesse with kefir 120kcals  \n  \n# Final edit  \n  \nthis will be my final edit of this thread as soon it will be history, and this is normal. we should leave place for new ones!

First, I'll start by giving what everyone wants to see: the pictures. http://imgur.com/a/mZqgz\n\nHere is a youtube video continuing on the story/one of my workouts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-9zLUFM5rU&feature=youtu.be\n\nAbout two years ago, I was not at all the same person that I am today. I did not go into college after graduating high school back in 2012 and my entire day was always spent playing League of Legends or going to play in Yu-Gi-Oh tournaments. I was pretty good at the games but my body paid the price for it. My lifestyle was completely sedentary and I had absolutely no understanding of nutrition or exercise. My parents didn't guide me on the right choices to make and I had to figure things out on my own.\n\nStarting in 2014, my friends decided that they wanted to get into the gym and lose some weight. I decided to join them and started off on the Stronglifts 5x5 program. At the time, I did not enjoy the process in the way that I do now. The diet that I followed was not very strict but any means but it was restriction of calories in a simple sense and increased activity which is better than nothing. \n\nEventually, I began to really see changes in my body composition and it pushed me to go even further. As I lost weight, I realized how differently people began to treat me. Most people were more friendly and I seemed to be valued more as a person. Despite reaching my initial goals of weight loss, it was not enough. Originally, I thought that losing weight was all that would make me happy but I didn't really like the way that I looked. Reddit was a good source of information for me and it kept me focused on my goals. \n\nMy diet was eventually down to a near starvation level as an attempt to speed up the process. In hindsight, it was not the best decision but what's done is done. When I reached my lowest weight of 162, I elected to try and gain back some muscle to increase my strength. When I was trying to lose weight, my goal of calories ranged from 1600-1800. It may sound low for a lot of people but I found that following an intermittent fasting schedule really made it much more bearable. \n\nRight now, my goals are more focused on powerlifting as opposed to bodybuilding but both are important to me. I plan to compete one day but I'm not quite strong enough yet. Here's some videos of my best lifts: \n435 Deadlift: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO4eIwIredg\n\n350 Squat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpv55F3CVns\n\n235 Bench: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZbGuBT0pRM\n\n155x3 Overhead press: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP03oevapww\n\nThroughout, I had tried many different programs. I've done 5/3/1, PPL variations, PHUL, Candito, and other miscellaneous programs. Ultimately, most were very similar when it came to results and it's important to the choose one that you like. Consistency was the key and having fun throughout. I act like a clown sometimes at the gym but it keeps me entertained and keeps me coming. \n\nAs my body changed, I changed as a person. I grew to like myself so much more and feel confident in who I am. Within this journey, I started going to college. I was so afraid of not living up to expectations due to all of the time between graduating high school. I managed to become a straight A student and I credit a lot of my brain gainz to my gym gainz. It taught me the mentality of pushing your limits and not settling for less than the best. \n\nThanks to my friends and family for supporting me throughout. Shoutout to joeyflexx7 from Instagram for giving me diet advice and helping me become a better powerlifter. I highly recommend anyone interested in powerlifting to check out his coaching. https://www.instagram.com/joeyflexx7/\n\nEDIT: One thing to add in regards to dieting. For me, I had to be really tough on myself to stick to it, especially when attending social situations. But as time went on, I learned to accept to be lenient sometimes and to enjoy the things that I wanted sometimes, like frozen Yogurt or Korean BBQ. In a way, I viewed it like a game of winning and losing days and as long as I won more than I lost, I'd make progress.\n\nEDIT 2: Sorry if it seemed confusing but yes, gaming is still a large part of my life. I could not do without the social experience of it because it allows for me to bond with my friends who I can't see in person so often. I usually play Hearthstone, Overwatch, and League. Feel free to add me at TrustedLoki on League and TrustedLoki#1651 on Battle.net. What I meant by the title is that my lifestyle before was basically to wake up, play league, eat, and sleep. Now I cut back the playtime immensely and fit it around lifting and school.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "M 21 230-172 2 Year Progress.

Started doing cardio 1-2 times/week and cut calories. July of 2017 I was around 145 lbs and took my fitness a step further and started working out at home every day. I didn\u2019t have a weight set, but I had a pair of 20lb dumbells and a pull up bar that I worked with and did lots of pushups and core. My routine wasn\u2019t very structured, but I made sure to work as much of my body as I could for about an hour/day.  \nAugust/September 2017 started going to the gym regularly. Started on a somewhat makeshift 6 day split a friend helped me make. Saw decent progress and was feeling really good.

Cardio was a little weird. I like to warm up with a 5 minute run at 7.5mph. I do 10-15 minutes of stairclimber post workout a few times/week and while on campus I do a HIIT circuit flipping and smacking tires with a sledge hammer twice/week. For Winter break I\u2019ve been doing Muay Thai kickboxing twice/week instead of the HIIT circuit.  \n  \n  \n**Diet:**  \nDiet was strict in the beginning. I was still eating at a slight caloric deficit July-September, started bulking in September. Being on my school\u2019s meal plan it was hard to eat cleanly and still get enough calories. I was a bit less strict at this time, I ate out occasionally. I didn\u2019t track everything, but I think I was around 3000 calories/day during the bulk.  \n  \nTypical day:  \nBreakfast: Cereal/Oatmeal, scoop of whey  \nSnack: Banana/Almonds  \nLunch: Whatever the dining hall is serving. I try to eat whatever protein source they have(usually some kind of chicken or beef) and veggies if they have them. Very hard to be consistent with this meal  \nDinner: Same as lunch  \nPost Workout: Protein shake (scoop of whey, banana, peanut butter)  \n  \nSupps: Whey protein, Creatine, Glucosamine Chondroitin (I have shitty joints)  \n  \n  \nOriginal plan was to start a cut in mid January, but I\u2019m going to continue the bulk since I haven\u2019t hit my goals yet. The next program I plan on trying is The Viking\u2019s Bare Bones ULPPL split, but I\u2019m open to suggestions.  \n  \nThanks guys, this subreddit was my main source of information.\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "From shit to fit 6 month progress", "post_ups": 3014, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7lrrvu/from_shit_to_fit_6_month_progress/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:11.988230", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "spockofwesteros", "post_created_utc": 1521393940.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1521444333.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "85cna0", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 375, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 3006, "post_selftext": "On my weight loss journey, I have come to realize something.

A lifetime of obesity was taking it's toll on me. My health was failing, and my romantic life and social life were failing even harder. I had tried to lose weight many times, and failed as many times. So I gave up.\n\nAnd although I had given up on ever finding the girl of my dreams, I made the foolish mistake of falling hard for a girl, only to be rejected again, as I had been every time before. So, with a shattered heart, I took one more stab at it. I spent hours on Reddit every day. I turned to you guys for inspiration, motivation, and education. I spent most of my time in /r/fitness, /r/keto, /r/loseit, and /r/progresspics. You people became my motivator, my trainer, my nutrition coach, and my friends.\nAnd you changed my life. In every way I can possibly imagine. My life is the complete opposite of what it once was, and I have only you to thank for it.\nThis post is my tribute to our community. It is my thank you to the best friends I have that I have never even met. I hope this post encourages and motivates you to move forward. Looking back now, I can clearly see that the only thing that ever stood in my way was my belief that there was nothing that I could do about it, so I never even tried. Please follow my example and don't give up on yourself.\n\nSo how did I do it? My first breakthrough happened by chance. I watched the movie \u201cFat, Sick, and Nearly Dead\u201d on Netflix. It inspired me to try a juicing diet for a week. I went from eating more than 6,500 calories a day to eating around a thousand. To my surprise I soon realized that I was less hungry than I had ever felt before. After finishing the juicing diet, I reintroduced protein, but my insatiable appetite never quite returned. That\u2019s when I realized it was carbs that were somehow triggering my appetite so I started following /r/keto. \n\nDiet Style: Keto, a high fat, moderate protein, low carb way of eating. I try avoid most carbs. Most carbs I get are from green vegetables (broccoli, asparagus, spinach, avocado, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower). My macro goals are 60% fat, 30% protein, and 10% carbs.\n\nCalories: TDEE is around 2,300 calories a day. I eat a 500 daily calorie deficit to lose weight. On the days that I lift I usually eat about 300 calories above my TDEE in extra protein.\n\nCardio: Minimum of 3 times a week. I do a mixture of indoor cycling, boxing, crossfit, stadium steps, kettle bells or running. Mixing it up mitigates the boredom and I think it\u2019s more effective than doing the same workout daily.  I started very slowly, basically just walking, but added a little every time I worked out. I never pushed myself too hard. I made that mistake in the past and I think its counter-productive if you\u2019re working out to the point that you don\u2019t enjoy your exercise. Its amazing to me how fit I got over the long term by making very small increments in effort on a daily basis. On weekends I\u2019m pretty active with paddle boarding, mountain biking, sky diving, or hiking. I personally feel like HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) in a fasted state is most effective for burning fat, but I\u2019ve had a bunch of bros flaming me for saying this. Don\u2019t really care. It worked very well for me.\n\nWeight lifting: After losing 80 pounds I hit a plateau that I couldn\u2019t seem to break through. Also, I had some excess skin that I wanted to tighten up so I started lifting weights. Surprisingly (to me) this broke the stall I was in and I lost another 40 pounds. Its also helped tremendously with the loose skin. I lift 4 days a week for 60-75 minutes. I do a split routine hitting each muscle group twice a week. I don\u2019t follow a specific program like starting strength or 5x5, but I vary my workout and lift as heavy as I can, using both free weights and machines. Although I vary my workout, I always try to include the basics, or slight variations of the basics (bench press, flys, dead lift, bent-over rows, push-ups, pull-ups, curls, preacher curls, squats, tricep pushdowns or extensions, close grip bench, leg press, leg extensions, dips). Again, I\u2019ve been told how ineffective this is by some of the folks on here, but unfortunately I didn\u2019t know that and I accidentally added a bunch of muscle anyway.\n\nWeight loss: Starting weight of 318 pounds at 49% body fat according to a bio-impedance scale. I now weight 195 pounds at 11% body fat measured by dexa. In total I lost approx. 123 pounds.\n\nHealth: I no longer show signs of pre-diabetes, metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver syndrome, my cholesterol has dropped over 80 points and I no longer take statins. I also have more energy than I ever remember having in my life.\n\nI truly believe the most important aspect of working out is just working out. A small, vocal group of bros attacked me this morning and told me how full of crap I am and how I\u2019m spreading misinformation. Its funny to me. I have spent almost 5 years reading, learning, and trying a bunch of different stuff. The only thing I know for certain is that even the smartest people in the world, who study this stuff professionally, don\u2019t quite understand the full picture yet. Maybe, just maybe, if I had the perfect routine and diet I would be a little leaner with a few pounds more muscle, but it doesn\u2019t matter to me. I am extremely happy with the result I have achieved to date. Don\u2019t let perfect be the enemy of good.\n\nFour and a half years may seem like a long time, but its not. It went by in a flash, just like it will if you do nothing to improve yourself, and every single day of this journey has had me feeling better and more confident about myself than the day before. There's an old saying that \"The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, the second best time is right now.\" So go ahead and plant right now.\n\nReddit, you not only saved my life, you gave me a life worth living. I want to thank you, and I hope to give back by motivating and inspiring you. Good luck.

I wanted to re-introduce myself to the sub! My name is Ian and I have posted a couple progress photos in the past but have never really been active on reddit until more recently. A little background about myself and my story:\n\n[This](http://imgur.com/a/aMGHj) is a photo of what I looked like at 300lbs and where I was after I cut sugar out of my diet at 195lbs. \n\n[This](http://imgur.com/a/cG0EU) is a year later, June 2017. I still weigh 195lbs but can see the difference in definition and have thinned out.\n\n[This](http://imgur.com/a/Cayga) is what I look like without a shirt on now (Sorry my closet is pretty messy ;P)\n\nI was always too ashamed to take a picture with my shirt off before so I don\u2019t have one for reference. My problem area has always been my mid section and my body is holding on for dear life. \n\nAbout ten years ago I hit 300lbs and was at my worst. I bought a gym membership and quickly saw 40lbs drop as I began watching what I ate and started doing more aerobic activity.  Soon after I hit a plateau and fell off the wagon. I struggled up and down for the next eight years going up and down between 240lbs- 260lbs.\n\nMentally I had started to accept that I was just \u201csupposed to be big\u201d for the rest of my life. I had been pretty active throughout that time but I wasn\u2019t seeing results \u2013 or the results that I did see would come and go in a blink of an eye.\n\nI was 24 years old and about two years into started my career in the entertainment industry. It isn\u2019t a lie \u2013 that is an industry where people treat you based on how you look. Not that people would ever put me down or be rude to me but it was obvious that I was overlooked for certain things or people would be short with me. I was on the cusp of my 25th birthday and took a job where I was responsible for dropping off the shows footage to post-production at the end of the night. The problem was I would most likely run into OT so production gave me money to get a meal at the end of the night. So at the end of the night I would drop the footage off and drive-thru somewhere to grab a bite that was paid for (They gave me $7 so it usually ended up being jack in the box \u2013 a Large Jumbo Jack meal with a Dr. Pepper to be exact. Two sides of Ranch).  \n\nOne night in particular I came home \u2013 got Jack in the Box, headed to my apartment and started to eat. In the middle of my burger I stopped and realized that I wasn\u2019t even hungry. I was eating the burger routinely and didn\u2019t even think twice about the fact that I didn\u2019t need to eat \u2013 I just did because hey, the food was covered by production and why wouldn\u2019t I?\n\nIt was in that moment that I realized I needed to take things more seriously in my diet. I knew that my weight was an obstacle for me not only personally \u2013 but it was actually affecting my long term goals in my career. I was 24, turning 25 and I was unhappy. I thought to myself \u201cMy twenties are supposed to be the best time of my life and look at me, I'm miserable.\u201d I know it sounds harsh but I had hit a low point and it was in that moment I decided I needed to make a change.\n\nNow \u2013 I want to just put it out there that I had always been a bigger kid and never really had a grasp of nutrition and was looking for a way to retrain myself how to eat. I had no sense of moderation because I never had to \u2013 it was always a \u201cLarge number fill in the blank\u201d or an entire bag of chips. I knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy and I would need help. I asked my roommate to do something for me that I wouldn\u2019t suggest anyone just doing \u2013 to be ruthless with me.  Now I want to make it clear that for me \u2013 I had to go to the extreme because I didn\u2019t know any other way. I asked her to be on top of me when it came to eating \u2013 be harsh. Make a comment if you see me slipping up \u2013 point out that I am messing up. This really helped ME a lot (again I don\u2019t suggest this for anyone). I had spent my entire life dealing with people bullying me and my weight and I wanted to use that as motivation and she did it. I told myself the next morning that I would cut out dairy and bread and that is where I would start.\n\nThe next day on set our Crafty crew had done the unthinkable \u2013 they made home made pizza bagels and walked around set offering them up. I had told my coworker that I had given up bread and dairy in hopes to drop weight and he scoffed saying that he would believe it when he saw it. If he hadn\u2019t been there in that moment to tell me that he didn\u2019t think I could do it, I\u2019m not sure I would have turned down that pizza bagel but I knew I couldn\u2019t budge. Time to prove people wrong.\n\nI spent the next 3 months without dairy or wheat of any kind and I saw 20lbs drop pretty quickly. That show came and went and it was on to the next, as did my 25th birthday. I had noticed that my sugar intake skyrocketed in the coming months. Sure I had dropped weight but I found myself replacing those things with sugar and soon my body stopped dropping weight and I started gaining again. It was at that time that I had read an article about sugar and the effects it had on your brain. The article noted that coming off sugar was very similar to breaking a meth addiction \u2013 I knew I had to see if I could do it.\n\nIt is interesting how my brain changed in this moment. When people start asking you how you dropped weight and what you did many of them were shocked to learn that cutting dairy and bread helped a lot (I hadn\u2019t really started working out at this point). I knew that I had to try.\n\nCutting sugar out of my diet was one of the toughest things I think I have ever done. It is NOT easy. The first two weeks are by far the most grueling \u2013 headache-inducing things I have ever had to do.  Mood swings, depression, anger, HUNGER, cravings, anything you could imagine. 25 years of my body were dependent on sugar and removing that put me through hell and back.\n\nAfter about two weeks of no sugar and feeling like I was ran over by a bus every day I woke up one day and felt\u2026amazing. My head was clear and I had more energy than I had ever had before. I spend about 2 months without sugar, diary, or wheat in my diet and dropped 45 more lbs. In this time I had started working out 4-5 days a week after work. I was exhausted but I knew It was what I needed to do to drop the res of this weight.\n\nEventually I reintroduced sugar, diary, and wheat into my diet within moderation. One thing that hasn\u2019t changed is my ability to eat. I try and keep these things out of my diet because I tend to binge on them now. I was 260lbs when I decided to give up dairy and sugar and today I weigh 195lbs. In total I am down 105lbs and never have felt better in my life.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t over and it never will be. I still binge eat, I still crave, but I have learned to tell myself no or stop myself from over eating. \n\nNow my workout consists usually of running 3-6 miles, 3 if I am circuit training, 6 if I am not. I follow that up with swimming 400-700 meters depending on whether or not I circuit train. \n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "100lbs down!

calorie or macronutrient goals. Supplements are indeed a viable method of helping to reduce this issue. However, it is important to note that over consumption of micronutrients is associated with a plethora of negative health effects. As such, it is important to be aware of the recommended daily intakes for each vitamin, and to consider taking lower doses if you choose to supplement.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCourtesy of /u/erin_rabbit: Basically, the RDA is how much 97-97% of the population need to stay healthy and ward off disease (e.g. vitamin C and scurvy). The \"Tolerable Upper Intake Level\" (UL) is the max amount that is generally regarded as safe. So you don't want to be below the RDA and you don't want to be above the UL. But it usually doesn't really matter where you fall between the two numbers.

A statistical error in the estimation of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D was recently discovered; in a correct analysis of the data used by the Institute of Medicine, it was found that 8895 IU/d was needed for 97.5% of individuals to achieve values \u226550 nmol/L. Another study confirmed that 6201 IU/d was needed to achieve 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/d was needed to reach 100 nmol/L. The largest meta-analysis ever conducted of studies published between 1966 and 2013 showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <75 nmol/L may be too low for safety and associated with higher all-cause mortality, demolishing the previously presumed U-shape curve of mortality associated with vitamin D levels. Since all-disease mortality is reduced to 1.0 with serum vitamin D levels \u2265100 nmol/L, we call public health authorities to consider designating as the RDA at least three-fourths of the levels proposed by the Endocrine Society Expert Committee as safe upper tolerable daily intake doses. This could lead to a recommendation of 1000 IU for children <1 year on enriched formula and 1500 IU for breastfed children older than 6 months, 3000 IU for children >1 year of age, and around 8000 IU for young adults and thereafter. Actions are urgently needed to protect the global population from vitamin D deficiency.\"\n\n**Conclusion:** \"Unfortunately, medicine took a very long time to realize that vitamin D is not simply a vitamin that prevents rickets. For that purpose, 400-600 IU/d may be enough. However, we know today that vitamin D is a powerful nuclear receptor-activating hormone of critical importance, especially to the immune system. With the available data mentioned above, the proposed doses would probably suffice to maintain vitamin D levels around or over 75-100 nmol/L, with practically zero risk of toxicity. Undeniably, further studies are needed to clarify the optimal supplementation of vitamin D, although it is uncertain whether a universal recommended dietary allowance is feasible. Meanwhile, actions are urgently needed to protect the global population from the threats posed by vitamin D deficiency.\"\n\n**tl;dr:** Talk to your physician about measuring your Vitamin D levels and see if supplementing more would be a good idea. (You probably shouldn't take more than 10,000 IU, though.)", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "The Big Vitamin D Mistake: new study shows that a mistake in older research is responsible for an RDA that's lower than it should be.", "post_ups": 2969, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7icizp/the_big_vitamin_d_mistake_new_study_shows_that_a/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:11.988230", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "thesisterfister", "post_created_utc": 1523716540.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "8c7wv3", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 357, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2957, "post_selftext": "**Progress Pics:** https://imgur.com/ISkgxTP\n\n**25M**\n\n**Height:** 5'11\"\n\n**Starting Weight:** 140lbs soaking wet\n\n**Current Weight:** 188lbs when carb depleted\n\n**Progression:** The timeframe of these photos spans five years, and it's amazing to think that all I did was some pushups before bed! (jk obviously, but I will get to training later).\n\n In the first pic, I was 140lbs in the summer of 2013, right before heading to university and beginning my weight training journey. I was weak, coming off of a breakup, and unhappy with my body \u2013 typical enough reasons to get into the weightroom.\n\nPic two was two years later in the summer of 2015 after I had ballooned up to 185lbs on a pretty successful bulk care of the university dining hall (see-food diet, yo), running various strength training programs in the meantime (started with SS, transitioned to Madcows, then Texas Method, then back to SS because I was an idiot and didn't understand programming). Decided at this point that I wanted out of T-Rex mode, so began to count calories and take my training in an aesthetics-oriented direction.\n\nPic three was taken in the spring of 2017 at a weight of around 180bs, with a massive cut and a lean bulk since the previous photo. During this time, I ran several \"aesthetics\" routines based around free weights and an alternation of of high volume/low intensity, and high intensity/low volume workouts. I started with PHAT, transitioned to the reddit PPL, and then devised my own PPL based on PHAT principles (3 heavy days followed by 3 volume days). The two years up to this photo I definitely saw the biggest changes in my physique, as I started to take my diet and training more seriously \u2013 counting calories became the norm, drinking tapered down as I entered my final years of uni, and I embraced the gym-rat lifestyle.\n\nPic four is my current physique, roughly a year after pic three and after I really fine tuned both my diet and exercise. In this phase I adopted a flexitarian diet where all home-cooked meals were vegetarian, switched routines to a 5/3/1-based brosplit, and started doing daily cardio. Five years in the making, I have almost achieved my goal physique.     \n\n**Diet:** My current diet for the last year has been primarily plant-based, with the occasional meat eaten socially (I'm not one to turn down a pizza because it has a little bit of pepperoni on it). I bulked to around 210 by mid-December on a roughly 4000 calorie diet with a heavy emphasis on peanut butter and whole milk to hit required calories, and since January have been cutting on a ~2400 cal, 300C/50F/190P macro split utilizing IF and an EC stack to control my appetite. I also will program a cheat meal (usually a large pizza of an order of fried chicken) once every two weeks, typically for dinner on Sunday.\n\n* **Breakfast:** A nice early morning walk. No food though.\n* **Lunch:** A stir fry containing basmati rice, tofu or soy-based veggie ground, mushrooms, spinach, broccoli, and a variety of spices and low-calorie sauces. Usually comes out to about 600 cals, 50-60g of protein, and I cycle which veggies to include.\n* **Pre-workout Meal:** 30g steel-cut oats with a scoop of chocolate whey isolate, 30g of natural peanut butter, cinnamon and stevia to taste.\n* **Post-workout Meal:** The same as my pre-workout meal, just with doubled portions oats and whey.\n* **Dinner:** A similar stir-fry to what I have for lunch.\n* **Before-bed Snack:** 30g of peanut butter washed down with a big glass of skim milk. I uhh really love peanut butter.\n* **Sample day of eating (though the macros got kinda fucked and the meals don't exactly align):** https://imgur.com/ti8em1J\n\n**Routine:** Although this might get some hate as it is a rather unique and potentially sub-optimal routine, I am currently running a bro-split I've devised which utilizes 5/3/1 progression on main lifts with back work everyday, arms and calves three times a week, and a focus on machines for assistance and hypertrophy work. My current 1RMs are B:285/S:425/D:445/OHP:190, so I'm by no means a beast in the weightroom, but I'm happy with my level of strength and improvement (I started out benching just the bar ffs). Why this style of training in particular? Simple: Up to this point I'd never actually run a bro-split and used almost exclusively free-weights, so I'm changing things up for the sake of variety and gaining weightroom experience/learning how my body reacts to this style of training. (Note: brevity's sake, Hammer Strength machines will be abbreviated to HS. Also, all days conclude with 30 mins of LISS on either the stairmaster or incline treadmill)\n\n* **Monday: Bench and chest, bit of bis and back**: Bench 5/3/1 with 5x5-8 FSL, HS Incline Press 4x8-15, Dips or HS Decline Press 4x8-15, Pec Dec 4x12-20, Hammer Curls superset with Seated Calf Raises 3x10, 50 pullups throughout the workout. \n* **Tuesday: Deadlift and back, abs:** Deadlift 5/3/1 with 5x5-8 FSL, HS Lat Pulldown 4x8-15, HS Row 4x8-15, HS Low Row 4x8-15, Facepulls 4x12-20, Hanging Knee Raises 4xF\n* **Wednesday: OHP and shoulders, bit of tris and back:** OHP 5/3/1 with 5x5-8 FSL, HS Shoulder Press 4x8-15, Lat Raises 4x12-20, RDF Machine 4x12-20, Rope Pushdown superset with Standing Calves 3x15, 50 pullups throughout the workout. Sometimes I'll also throw some facepulls in at the end.\n* **Thursday: Arms lol:** I don't really even program this day. I will start with 5 supersets of chins and dips, and then hit bis and tris for maybe 10-15 sets each with whatever exercises I want. An example day might be BB Curls 4x5-8. Hammer Curl 4x8-12, Preacher Curl 4x12-15, Skullcrusher 4x5-8, French Press 4x8-12, Rope Pushdown 4x12-15.\n* **Friday: Squarts and legs, abs:** Squats 5/3/1 with 5x5-8 FSL, Leg Press 5x5-10, Leg Curl 5x10-20, Leg Extension 5x10-20, any calf raise variant 5x8-30, Hanging Knee Raises 4xF, 50 pullups throughout workout.\n* **Saturday and Sunday: Fasted Walks:** I'll usually walk for a good two hours throughout the day, heading downtown for a coffee and some quiet contemplation. If I walk past a low hanging bar I'll usually bro-down and bang out a set of chins, too.\n\n**Where do I go from here?** Get bigger, leaner, and stronger bruhs. I will finish my cut on June 1st (as my uni graduation ceremony is in the 2nd, no real reason for cutting until then other than having a concrete goal) and then enter a lean-mass phase, and I hope to reach a 200lbs OHP, 300lbs bench, and 500lbs squat and deadlift by the end of the year. Hope this wasn't too long and boring of a post, stay swoll my friends.\n\n \n\n\n\n**Bonus Back Pic (no earlier pics, unfortunately):** https://imgur.com/rc6uQ6K\n\n**TL;DR:** Peanut butter is good, progress takes time, were all gonna make it.\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "My 5 year transformation progress from skinny to fat to fit to fitter", "post_ups": 2957, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8c7wv3/my_5_year_transformation_progress_from_skinny_to/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:11.988230", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "cosplayerkyo", "post_created_utc": 1452621539.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "40niwq", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 685, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2961, "post_selftext": "Hi Reddit,\n\nThought I would like to share my experiences and knowledge of my progression so far, as well as the improvement of my own home gym.  I apologize in advance that this is a pretty long post but I'm hoping someone can learn from my many trials and errors.\n\nHere is a progression of my front:\n[Front](http://i.imgur.com/WoUQnIA.jpg)\n\nHere is my progression of my back:\n[Back](http://i.imgur.com/qNTqEcV.jpg)\n\n\n**Beginning Learning Phase**\nAs you can see, in January 2012, I was a very skinny guy.  Weighting at 135, I was that guy who would complain that my high metabolism was the reason why I could not gain any weight.  I used to think I was eating a lot, and I certainly did indulge in mainly potato chips, sodas, and fast food.  Looking back, I probably only ate two meals a day so I probably ate less then 2000 calories daily.\n\nTired of being scrawny, this led me to working out in the gym, hoping I can start growing some muscles (even my own family made fun of how scrawny I was).  So like the typical gym newbie, I mainly concentrated on bench press with horrible technique, abs, abs, abs, abs, and probably some abs.\n\nWith no results showing, I started looking elsewhere.  P90X?  That sounds awesome.  And all of my friends were suggesting that I'm a hard gainer and I should be eating at a huge bulk.  So I discovered myfitnesspal, decided that I know better and that I should bulk at 3000 calories, and stuck with it.\n\nWith all of the craziness that comes with P90X, I was forced into doing things like pull ups, plyometrics jump training, yoga, wall squats.  Hated it all but soon, the numbers started going up.  I can do more then 1 pull up, I can do more then 3 push ups.  And even though I worked a desk job, spent 5 hours playing World of Warcraft every night, and assumed I had no flexibility because I was a guy, yoga really started improving me a lot.\n\nAll this, and I was still consuming 3000 calories daily.  Gotta bulk right?  So as you see in September 2012, I ballooned up to 150 lbs.  I looked in the mirror and compared it to all of the P90X before and after pictures, and thought What the hell...  why don't I have ripped abs after all this?\n\nMiserable, exhausted, but not beaten, I opened up the nutrition book on P90X and realized I should try their weight loss nutrition.  I lowered my calories to 1800 calories as recommended and whatever macros they recommended.  I started eating peanut butter, chicken breasts, rice, protein shakes, and made sure I only ate 1800 calories or less.\n\nInterestingly enough, this is where I learned about **iifym**.  At the time, my girlfriend always wanted to go out and eat, so I started searching myfitnesspal to see what I can squeeze into my 1800 calories of macros.  Even used to squeeze in Korean BBQ in there from time to time.\n\nAnyways, behold my P90X result in the end of December.  I was ripped, leaned, and look at those shiny abs poking through.  Then that moment hit when looking at the mirror and I thought...  I want bigger muscles.  I look lean but I just look like a skinny guy with abs and I don't like this.  I weighted 127 lbs at the end of this.\n\n\n\n**Weight lifting and injuries**\nBeing a big P90X fan, I decided to check out Body Beast.  It taught how to do more weight lifting at home, and honestly, it wasn't that bad of a program to teach someone new.  God I hated leg days...   so a few months of doing this program, and eating around 3000 calories again, I did start gaining weight pretty fast.  But I thought, gotta bulk to grow!\n\nSometime around 2013, I wound up injuring my left wrist from being an idiot on a punching bag.  This put me on a cast and I wasn't allowed to lift weights for a solid 4 months.  During this time, I did some running here and there to try to keep some of my weight off.\n\n\n\n**Barbell Lifting**\nOnce I was given the okay to lift weights again, this is when I decided to take a step back, and actually research.  Why did I gain weight so quick?  How come people bench press or deadlift?  With all of this knowledge in mind, I started to learn each of the main moves.  About 2 months into it, I then discovered 5x5 Stronglifts.  I cannot praise this enough...  if you are new and want to learn how to barbell lift, please please please look into this.  With this training going, my bulk method was to eat around 2200 calories until I don't gain weight for a week solid.  If I don't gain weight, go up 50 calories and continue.\n\nBy the end of my barbell lifting bulk, I was 145 lbs.  My squat was at 5x5 of 200 lbs, bench press at 5x5 of 170 lbs, and deadlift of 5x5 at 200 lbs.  I praised on lifting the main moves, and counting macros to everyone.  I told people that it doesn't have to be organic foods, or that a soda's sugar won't kill you if you start counting the carbs and calories from it.  Yet, everyone laughed and told me I was being stupid and I don't look lean so what do I know?  I should be eating organic \"healthy\" foods only and do a lot of cardio.\n\n\n\n**Cut Phase with no cardio and Chipotle**\nSo I made a bet with someone.  I was going to start my cut in November 2014 so that I can look ripped for February 2015.  I will eat Chipotle and it's sodium filled deliciousness EVERYDAY, a lot of red wine on the weekends, along with doing only 5x5 stronglifts.\n\nI researched on how to cut properly.  Try your best to lose weight slowly, do not rush down to a ridiculous amount of calories.  Once the weight stops going down, then cut a few more calories and stick with that as long as you can.  While cutting, try your best to retain as much of your strength as possible.  With this knowledge in mind, I dropped from 145 lbs to 131.6 lbs.\n\nMind you, I lifted 3 times a week, doing strictly 5x5 Stronglifts and I liked to do yoga once a week.  No cardio at all.  And I literally ate at Chipotle everyday...  sometimes even twice a day.  And the red wine?  I probably two bottles worth each weekend (alcohol is the 4th macro btw).\n\n\n\n**Maintenance**\nFrom February 2015 to July 2015, I decided change my workouts to a push pull legs program, and  understand my maintenance calories (Maintenance calories are when you do not gain or lose weight at your current lifestyle).  My lift numbers went up a little, with my squat at 5x5 of 210, bench at 5x5 of 175, and deadlift at 5x5 at 245.\n\nI started watching youtube videos and following people on Instagram.  Looking at Timbahwolf Kane eating shin ramen so often made me started eating it daily.  Watching Layne Norton talk about how metabolism works, and how to incorporate macros made me realize how I can fine tune how to gain or lose weight.\n\n\n\n**Bulk**\nSince September 2015, I decided to go on a bulk.  I want to get stronger and bigger.  The more muscle you have, the more you need to eat to fuel that body.  To me, that sounds like a win win situation.  When bulking, you will grow muscle but will gain some fat along the progress.  So you could go yolo and eat like a maniac but you'll have a lot of fat to lose when it's time to cut.  Or you can bulk at a steady pace and try to gain as least fat as possible.\n\nSince July 2015 to January 2016, I have been slowly bulking from 138 lbs and currently sitting at 145 lbs.  I no longer do a 5x5 structure but have stuck with my push pull legs program.  My current one max reps are squat at 280 lb, bench at 210 lb., and deadlift at 340 lb.  I am looking to bulk for a few more months before I cut again.\n\n\n\n**Summary and what I've learned**\nIf you are skinny and have trouble gaining, go learn how to barbell lift, learn how to count macros, and bulk slowly.  Anyone skinny who wants to look \"toned\", you're going to look pathetic when you lose your body fat because you have no muscles poking out to show off.  Go bulk.\n\nIf you're looking to lose some weight?  Learn to count macros, lower calories slowly, and don't be afraid to lift weight.  Growing muscle takes forever compared to losing fat, and you will not become massive overnight.\n\nI cannot praise barbell training enough.  Learn how to properly squat, learn how to properly bench, and learn how to properly deadlift (I still spam Layne Norton's tutorial videos during my warm up just so I don't forget anything).  Start with a 5x5 program, and throw away your ego.  \n\nHonestly, if I can go back in time, I wish I could have just started off with barbell training and counting macros correctly.\n\n\n\n**Home Gym**\n[Home Gym Progress](http://imgur.com/a/LR3Kv)\n\nI started off with some Bowflex weights (don't buy them), a pull up bar, a yoga mat, and some basic weights.  Once I started squats, I picked up a set of Valor BD-9 stands.  Don't waste your time with them unless need their mobility.  They are a pain in the butt to keep setting up every time.\n\nOnce I committed and bought a squat rack, this changed my world.  Worth every penny.  No longer do I have to go to a gym and fight others for the rack cage.  And no longer will I feel guilty of doing bicep curls in the rack cage.\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Trials and errors, my 2012-2016 from skinny, fat, and now.", "post_ups": 2961, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/40niwq/trials_and_errors_my_20122016_from_skinny_fat_and/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:11.988230", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Samolae", "post_created_utc": 1532466104.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1532554197.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "91ld92", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 96, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2940, "post_selftext": "I also remember you could select female or male, and then you could choose a muscle from the backside or front side of the person.

So after years of on and off lifting, I finally cracked down in the past year and really went for it. So here's my own transformation post...\n\nFirst off: everybody loves pictures, so here's what I've got. Unfortunately I didn't take many when I was so skinny because I hated the look of my body that much. But here's a few to get an idea...\n\nBefore:\n[From high school to a little over a year ago, right before I started lifting heavy.](http://imgur.com/a/0KZgf)\n\nAfter:\n[Now. Around 180-185 in all of these.](http://imgur.com/a/T5gVY)\n\nA little backstory: I was very skinny and underweight all throughout high school, my driver's license actually still says 6'0\" tall and 125 lbs. While I was always athletic, playing competitive soccer my entire life, I was never big or strong. Once I started college I actually became more introverted and less fit and struggled a lot with self image. Eventually, due to a number of reasons, I dropped out of college after 2 years to chase after the long long goal of becoming a Navy SEAL (laugh all you want) and this is where my actual fitness journey really begins. \n\nI had friends who were SEALs and knew everything there was to know, so I trained for the physical fitness test in order to get selected for the SEAL program. The test consists of a 500 yd swim, max push ups in 2 minutes, max sit ups in 2 minutes, max pull ups untimed, and then a 1.5 mile run. The pass/fail times were rather low, but you're fighting for a small number of slots against a very large amount of people, so you need good scores. Eventually I succeeded in getting selected and left for boot camp. At this time I was around 155 lbs. After completing boot camp I went to the BUD/S preparatory course, which would be a wet dream for every one of you here. 2 months of just working out with Olympic level trainers and athletes. At the end of that we took another fitness test similar to the first one, except with a 1000 yd swim and 4 mile run, with much tougher pass/fail guidelines. I passed that with a 17:26 swim, 82 push ups, 96 sit ups, 14 pull ups, and a 27:46 run. I was definitely fit at this point, but still very skinny. \n\nSkipping through the details, I did participate in quite a bit of BUD/S but did not pass. However, I did do well enough to get selected immediately afterwards to another special operations type job in the Navy which I successfully passed and currently work in today. After always being the skinny guy and never as fast/strong as my peers, I finally buckled down and started lifting heavy a year ago. \n\nPrograms:\nI started with 5x5 stronglifts for about 4 months, then switched to Arnold's blueprint just to try to put on some mass for another 4 months, and have been doing Wendler 5/3/1 since then. The \"less boring\" version of Boring But Big. \n\nTL;DR\nHere's my changes\nHeight: 6'0\"\n\nStarting weight: 160\nCurrent weight: 185\nStarting arm size: 13\"\nCurrent arm size: 15.5\"\n\nLifts:\nStarting lifts were pretty damn weak. All 1 rep maxes. \nSquat: 165\nDeadlift: 225\nBench: 125\nOverhead Press: 95\n\nCurrent lifts:\nSquat: 295\nDeadlift: 345\nBench: 220\nOverhead Press: 135\n\nDiet:\nI'm terrible with diet, always have been. I just eat as much as I can whenever I can. I've made the most gains when I force myself to eat every 2 hours and just crush peanut butter and whole milk with every meal. \n\nGoals:\nLong time goals have always been 2 plate bench, 3 plate squat, 4 plate deadlift. Not quite there yet but at least I'm not completely embarrassed of my lifts anymore. \n\nTips: \nI am by no means any kind of fitness expert, but I'm sure I've struggled in areas that a lot of others have also struggled with. A few things that helped me push myself and actually stay motivated to keep going back to the gym:\n\nI used to always do a set at a certain weight and say \"man that was hard, I think I'll stay at that weight.\" Eventually I decided I couldn't actually know what my limits were unless I actually found them. So even if something seemed hard, I would add more weight to the next set anyways. I was always surprised at how much weight I could add before I actually reached a point where I knew I was definitely at my limit. \nFor motivation: I remember reading a Terry Crews AMA awhile back where he said the best way to keep going to the gym is to make it your happy place. Just get there. You might get there and not even work out, just read a magazine, but just be there and be comfortable with the place. For some reason that really struck a chord with me and helped me a lot. I make it a habit to go to the gym every single day, even rest days, so it's always a part of my schedule and my second home. I used to always be embarrassed to go to the gym because I was so skinny and everybody was lifting way bigger weights than me. But fuck that. If I see a fat person hating their life while running on the treadmill I have 1000x more respect for them than the fat person riding a mobility chair in wal mart. Everybody recognizes you're taking the steps to better yourself and respects you for it. As embarrassed as you may be, more people are looking up to you than looking down on you. And those who are looking down on you are probably fucking losers anyways so fuck em. \n\n\nEdit: realize now I should've put my age on here. Started at 21, currently 25.

Was always a very active guy but some things in my life back in that time period kinda got me off the fitness train. Turns out there was a 90 days body transformation contest starting at the same time I told myself I would start cutting for the summer, so that was a great motivator.\n\n\n**Diet:**\n\n\nEveryone knows to lose weight it is pretty simple, you need to burn more than you eat. Simple, not easy. I decided to go pretty strict and to go cold turkey. Now I'll admit at the start I thought I would get to 200lbs and call it a day, the last time I was under that number was back when I was in university, but as I kept going, I kept dropping, feeling good and looking great so I kept at it. Granted when I calculated my TDEE I was a little too conservative in my calculations for my maintenance calorie goal so I ended in a bigger deficit than I originally intended.\n\nFirst month was 2300 calories a day, at least 200g of protein, the rest didn't really care. With the meals I ended going with I was very low carbs, but that worked out fine for me. The first month I had to detox from sugar, mood swings, headaches and the whole nine yards.\n\nMonth #2, down to 2000 calories a day. At this point I was losing on average 2lbs a week which was great but kinda fast looking back. Still keeping with the 200g of protein a day. I would meal prep on Sundays everything I was allowed to eat for that week. The secret? Friday night was pizza night. I was allowed 4 slices to keep my sanity. I am not a big drinker to start with so cutting alcohol wasn't hard for me and only went with water on diet drinks.\n\nMonth #3 was the hardest, 2000 calories a day + lots of cardio. Meals stayed the same, I ended up eating the exact same thing for every meal except lunch every single day. I would switch my lunch recipe every week or two to keep things \"fresh\". Month #3 was the hardest, finish line was approaching and I was getting cravings again.\n\nWhenever I was really hungry or had massive cravings I would give myself a portion (15g) of the rice chips. The last month I was also drinking probably 4 cans of diet ice tea a day....!\n\n\n**Workout routine:**\n\nSimple PPL, worked out 6 times a week, hit every part twice. Kept my deadlift with my pull day. So I had chest and tris, back and bis, legs and shoulders. Would always hit my main lifts and I would alternate the accessories.  I would also focus on chest on the first push day and tris on the second push day to keep things balanced.\n\nMy 1RMs at the end of the cut:\n\nSquat: 325lbs\n\nDeadlift: 325lbs\n\nBench: 225lbs\n\nOHP: 135lbs\n\n\n**Cardio:**\n\nRan 3 times a week outdoors, also played volleyball once a week. With such a high calorie deficit I could only run 5ks, which I would do twice a week + a 2.4k once a week.\n\n**Sleep:**\n\nSleep was very crucial. You are putting a lot of stress on your body and it needs extra time to recover when you are in such a high deficit, made sure to drink plenty of water and tried my hardest to get at a minimum 8 hours of sleep per night.\n\n**Before and after:**\n\n[And here are the pictures, very happy with the results, but now I'll try to not go back to fat and simply maintain!](http://imgur.com/a/EWGS6)\n\nNow I'm back on maintenance calories and feel much much better, lost a bit of definition in the abs but I am now seeing progress in the weight room while being in a deficit, I was simply happy with not losing too much strength.\n\n**TL:DR**: Don't eat much, lift a lot, run a lot, feel like shit, look awesome!\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "90 days transformation challenge, from out of shape back to fit - 27lbs lost M/28/6'2\" 214lbs -> 187lbs", "post_ups": 2929, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/6fe941/90_days_transformation_challenge_from_out_of/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:11.988230", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Iamwizardirl", "post_created_utc": 1397321291.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1397407687.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "22v2o4", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 555, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2933, "post_selftext": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYTrFdK1hc\n\nHope you guys have a laugh, like I did.Enjoy.\n\nEdit:Wooow this is getting a lot of feedback.Glad you like it.\n\nAlso:Heeey mom I'm on /r/all !!", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Eating junk food at the gym.This guy lol.", "post_ups": 2933, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/22v2o4/eating_junk_food_at_the_gymthis_guy_lol/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:11.988230", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "recoveryguyweightlos", "post_created_utc": 1457545397.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1457550727.0, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "49p6a0", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 477, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2926, "post_selftext": "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sclmPaSubIY\n----\nBefore (eg from 15/7/14 I started to change) 120.7kg \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3tyO7Qh.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HFPlkfn.jpg\n----\nAfter 15/12/15 79.8kg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WSLstWS.jpg\n----\nHeight 171cm\n----\nBody Fat Before ~50% according to bodyfat scales After \u2013 15.8%\n\n\n----\nDiet - I kept it simple, 500 below maintenance using whole unprocessed foods. \n\nA typical day would look like this \n\nMeal 1 - Home made protein bar\n\nMeal 2 - Tuna Protein Roll \n\nMeal 3 - Fruit/salad smoothie with a scoop of protein \n\nMeal 4 - Cous cous with tuna \n\nMeal 5 - Beef curry with stir fried veg \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4cdDieA.jpg\n\n\nOn other days when I haven't done 1000 calories worth of exercise like I had that day it would be more like \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DklLbxs.jpg \n\nMeal 1 - Home made protein bar \n\nMeal 2 - Tuna protein roll \n\nMeal 3 - Chilli con carne, stir fried veg and 6 eggs \n\nI make a few meals up in advance, all can be done in a slow cooker, all super simple.

That way when I come home after a hard day all i have to do is basically put my own version of a microwave meal in the microwave and prepare my fresh veggies to go with. On days when I can afford the extra calories I will sling a load of eggs in as well. \n\nIts nothing out of the norm, just good, minimally processed whole foods to make everything and then conveniently portioned up. \n\n----\nExercise - Varied over the 18 months, started out with 5x5 and a bunch of walking now I destroy myself on the stairmill and lift upper lower split.\n\n----\n\nSpecifics around routine. \n\nFirst 6 months was the traditional 5x5 model \n\nStrongLifts 5x5 \nWeek 1 \nMonday - Squat 5x5, Bench 5x5, Barbell row 5x5\nWednesday - Squat 5x5, OHP 5x5, Deadlift 1x5 \nFriday - Squat 5x5, Bench 5x5, Barbell row 5x5 \n\nWeek 2 \nMonday - Squat 5x5, OHP 5x5, Deadlift 1x5\nWednesday - Squat 5x5, Bench 5x5, Barbell row 5x5 \nFriday - Squat 5x5, OHP 5x5, Deadlift 1x5 \n\nI would also do 15 minutes of HIIT cardio after every lifting session and more often than not I would swim on the off days Tuesday and Thursday. However it was very gentle swimming more for stretching and recovery than additional cardio as such. \n\n\nAfter the first 6 months I ran the same above but I adapted it a little and added in some accessories, curls and ab work mostly as they were the parts that seemed to be lacking. \n\n\nNow I run something of my own design that I've slowly developed and tweaked over the last 4 months or so. Its a heavy workload but I've found it works for me so far, strength and mass is up and bodyfat has remained around the same. I've called it Strypertrophy LUCLU because its both strength and hypertrophy based on following the upper/lower protocol different days. I use my Wednesday for stretching and intense cardio. You'll notice the lack of deadlifts, I do do them on my second lower day fairly often, however I squat more so... \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/7qbQXti.jpg\n\n----\n\nAs for me and my story the video is obviously above but further to that.... \n\nCrikey, where to start. In July 2014 I landed up in hospital with severe abdominal pains after vomiting some blood. My body, ravaged from alcoholism and drug addiction that got progressively worse over a 15 year period decided to push back. When I got into hospital my resting hr was rarely below 100, I weighed 120kg + and my cholesterol was measured at 21, yes 21, it should be less than 5. I would get out of breath just walking across the room. Hell I basically didn't leave my bed there in those last few weeks to do anything but visit the toilet and that was literally a huge challenge everyday. I was drinking upwards of 6000 calories a day and as many as 60-80 units and the weight and misery kept piling on.\n\n\nI was broken, physically, mentally and spiritually broken. Lying in that hospital that night I realised that I didn't want to die, that no matter how bad a person I thought I was or how bad a person I thought I had been, nobody deserved to die on their knees. It was 2 days later after a rough couple of days detox before I could even face food but when I did I entered it into a popular fitness app for the first time. I had made the decision whilst lying there in fear of death for some time that I had to change and the best way I know to change is to get up and do something about it there and then, not next month, not next week, right now. \n\n\nI left hospital a few days later practically detoxed from alcohol, I was still suffering some sweats and shakes occasionally but for all intents and purposes just being mindful over my food choices in those early days, in a hospital setting, had me feeling better.\n\n\nIt was strange really, I had come to a place in my life many times where I resolved to quit, I made grand promises and I really believed them. One more try though was always rapidly followed by one more failure. This time though something just felt different and I think it was because I really believed myself when I told myself I wanted to change. You see I would lie to myself all the time and everyone else for that matter. I was dishonest, cowardly, manipulative, malicious and vile on a daily basis and it was all for the stupidest of reasons, because I thought that was who I was supposed to be.\n\n\nIt\u2019s been more than just the weight loss for me as you can probably tell. I have fundamentally changed as a person, I\u2019ve found help from a local addiction service, a fellowship community and my self awareness has been dialled in. I try to treat everybody the best I can, not judge, be honest and remember where I came from everyday now and life is infinitely easier. Anxiety is down, self confidence is up.\n\n\nSo I was out of hospital, all set with my goal in mind of getting to 15% bodyfat and itching to go running or any number of things. However I had strict instructions from the doctors when leaving the hospital to take it slowly, I was told no more than 1 mile a day walking for at least a month to start with such was the physical trauma I\u2019d put my body through it would have been ill advised to run before I could walk so to speak. So that\u2019s what I did, I started out walking ramping it up week on week, towards the end of the month I was doing about 5 miles a day and hiked up a local landmark without pause something I couldn\u2019t have done for at least 5 years prior when I attempted to get sober. 2 months in I did a 21 mile walk for meningitis.\n\n\nAfter about 6 weeks I was down about 10kilos already. I joined a gym and started out using 5x5 on my phone, I had dipped in and out of weight rooms at times but never taken it seriously at all so I dropped all of my ego about the place and started with a beginner strength program. I felt getting the basics right before anything else was the way for me to go. I ran that for about 6 months in which time I got myself below 100 kilos for the first time in a little over ten years. The next 6 months I ran a variation of 5x5, just a few lifts added into the mix for all intents and purposes rather than anything radical. During these 6 months my weight began to fall off a lot slower, it seemed my body was pretty sweet with being around 97 kilos, even more so around 80kg when I hit that. I guess that change in pace was a hurdle for me. I was so used to seeing the weight come off in greater increments it shook me for a while, I started to doubt myself and my choices became sloppy again. Nevertheless I kept up my training throughout and when I haven\u2019t lost weight I\u2019ve seemed to gain muscle, sometimes I just stay the same and then one week it all seems to come at once.\n\n\nThese days I don\u2019t monitor the scale so closely, I use it as a rough guide but the mirror and photos tell me more now. However I am aboute to strip right down to 10% or less and see just how bad my loose skin situation is going to be. Ultimately I am not finished, not by a long shot, I feel I will always seek to gradually improve every aspect of my being, this is who I am now, its who I always was deep down.\n\nMy life now is infinitely improved, my resting heart rate is in the mid 40's, my cholesterol was 2 point something on the last check, my cardio health has improved dramatically, I'm stronger, faster than I have ever been and all my bloods have returned to safe ranges. The mental shift has probably been the bigger one though, I can hand on heart say I am trying every day to be a better man and I am eternally grateful to all those who helped me and ever more pleased to be able to give something back. I have a debt I owe for where I am today and I intend to repay it in full.\n\n\nI guess to summarise its been more than the weight loss, I have fundamentally changed as a person and I no longer despise myself. The weight room has been a reminder for me that the more I put into anything the more I get out and that\u2019s how I start my day.

They are quite easy to learn, if you watch out for a few form cues, so i hope you enjoy it.\n\nIf you don't want to watch the video, i'll also include an explantion below.\n\n* For the archer push ups, **[you start in a plank position](http://imgur.com/ByQ4CDi)** and externally rotate your arms, while keeping them about double-shoulder width apart.\n\n* **[Hand positioning in the upper part.](http://imgur.com/0EbN9yv)**\n\n* Now you lean to one side, while keeping the other arm completely straight. **[The bottom position should look like this](http://imgur.com/VvD1kxu)** While you do so, internally rotate your arm and keep your elbow close to your body.\n\n* **[Hand positioning in the bottom part.](http://imgur.com/tmmLnX8)**\n\n* Now you press up into the starting position, while keeping the elbow of the straight arm completely straight. Repeat to the other side.\n\n* Form cues: You need to keep your straight arm completely straight at all times, or you're doing a biceps exercise - which isn't the goal of the archer push up. You want to train your chest, triceps and your deltoids - and this is best achieved by having your elbow straight. This way, your biceps and brachialis aren't activated as much. This also makes the exercise much harder!\n\n* A good way to build up to archer push ups is, by starting weighted push ups and work up to 20%-30% of added bodyweight. Once you are able to do 2-3 reps with that weight added, you'll find negative archers easily achievable, and real archer push ups aren't far away.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this tutorial and find it helpful to achieve this new cool skill. :) I've got a few questions aswell, to start a discussion:\n\n* If you can already do them, what progression did you use to learn archer push ups?\n\n* Have you tried archers before and failed to keep your arm straight?

I have seen people giving this advice very often to those asking for weight loss tips, but I can't help but think that it's a little too simplistic. \n\n[I was reading this article](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-gut-bacteria-help-make-us-fat-and-thin/) in Scientific American about how gut bacteria influence the way we digest food, and that in twins who are split between being lean and obese, there was a noticeable difference between the health of their gut bacteria. A later study controlled for the old causation/correlation thing, too.\n\nAnd then I learned that [only 10% of Americans eat enough fiber, and 53% of Americans think steak is a significant source of fiber](http://www.nationalfibercouncil.org/af_are.shtml).* And I also read that [dietary fiber](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3705355/) [plays a significant role in the health of gut bacteria](http://advances.nutrition.org/content/4/1/16.full), and [a low fiber diet may cause irreversible damage to gut microbe populations over generations](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2016/01/low-fiber-diet-may-cause-irreversible-depletion-of-gut-bacteria.html). And if you decide to improve your gut health, [it may take a long time before your new high-fiber diet has significant effects](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3368382/). \n\n*[The same statistic from a less biased source](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/early/2012/05/28/jn.112.160176.full.pdf)\n\nSo, I mean, why do we just say \"calories in, calories out\"? If someone eats 1700 calories of ham sandwiches on wonderbread, and burns 2000 calories, they are still doing damage to their health and stacking the deck against themselves when it comes to losing weight in the long term. I think this is a big reason why chronic dieters continue to gain back weight; they successfully eat at a deficit for a few months and lose the pounds, but their digestive system isn't healthy enough to maintain that weight when they eat a normal diet (not at a calorie deficit, which is obviously unsustainable). I came across so many more studies about how gut microbes control our blood sugar, how often we feel hungry, and even maintain the protective coatings on our nerve endings. With western peoples' diets so shockingly low in fiber and other probiotic foods, and that study that suggested in a few generations the damage could be irreversible, why isn't this being treated as a much more serious problem? Why don't we ever hear about it? I mean at this rate, 90% of Americans are setting up their grandchildren to be completely incapable of even establishing healthy gut microbes. Is that kind of terrifying, or is it just me?\n\n\nEDIT: Fuck, I butchered the title. Well I'm lazy so I'm not gonna repost it. Do with me what you will, grammar nazis.\n\nEDIT 2: [Here is a list of some foods that are high in fiber](http://www.eatingwell.com/nutrition_health/nutrition_news_information/top_fiber_rich_foods_for_good_gut_bacteria), and [another one](https://draxe.com/high-fiber-foods/), and [one more](http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/making-one-change-getting-fiber-can-help-weight-loss-201502177721). \n\nKids, eat your guacamole.

Previously I've submitted analyses of [drug-free powerlifting meet results](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8wdrox/how_age_strength_and_sex_impact_strength_gains/), the [periodization literature](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7p27br/a_comprehensive_overview_of_the_periodization/), and the [sex differences literature](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8b8t26/strength_and_muscle_gains_in_men_vs_women/).\n\nOnce again I found myself with too much time and data on my hands, and this time I tackled training frequency.\n\nAs a bit of background, training frequency has been a contentious subject for a while now.  When I first got into lifting in 2005-2006, there was a really strong orthodoxy in favor of pretty low training frequencies.  Bodybuilders trained each muscle once per week, powerlifters mostly trained each exercise once or twice per week, and that's just the way things were.  Starting in 2010 or 2011, more people started experimenting with higher frequencies as Sheiko programs and Smolov started getting popular, and in 2012, the Norwegian Frequency Project was published.  For those unaware, the Frequency Project caused a pretty big stir.  It found that, in a group of pretty well-trained powerlifters, training each lift six times per week led to significantly larger strength gains than training each lift three times per week.  For years, there were a lot of forum wars waged over that study, because there was very little high-quality frequency research (so a lot of people put a bunch of their eggs in the basket), but it was never actually published in a peer-reviewed journal (so a lot of people completely disregarded it).\n\nHowever, in just the last ~6 months, the frequency literature has entered a renaissance.  The number of volume-matched studies comparing the effects of different training frequencies on strength gains has doubled.  So, I gave them a thorough analysis.  Here are the basic findings:\n\n1) Using standard meta-analytic procedures, [higher training frequencies are associated with larger strength gains](https://i2.wp.com/www.strongerbyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Frequency-forest-plot-1.png?w=640&ssl=1).  There were two positive outliers.  When removing them, the effect is still significant.  The effect is small (d=0.27 with the outliers included, and d=0.25 without them), but actually comparable to the effects of volume on strength gains, according to a [recent meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28755103) by Ralston et al.\n\n2) The effect was significant for both trained and untrained lifters.\n\n3) There seems to be a [roughly linear relationship](https://i0.wp.com/www.strongerbyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Weekly-Strength-Gains-smart.png?w=990&ssl=1) between frequency and strength gains up to at least a 4x/week frequency.  There weren't many studies with really high frequencies, so it's hard to say whether the relationship holds past that point.\n\n4) The most important finding was that the effect of frequency on strength gains was [large and consistent for pressing exercises](https://i2.wp.com/www.strongerbyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Frequency-upper-body-2.png?w=675&ssl=1).  However, frequency did not seem to significantly affect strength gains for compound lower body exercises (i.e. squats, leg press, etc.).\n\nStandard caveats apply.  Science deals with averages, so we can't know if these results will generalize to you, as an individual.  Maybe you do poorly with high-frequency pressing, but high-frequency squatting is great for you.  However, we do now have pretty robust evidence that higher training frequencies are beneficial for strength gains, particularly for pressing exercises.  Also note, this analysis deals solely with strength, not hypertrophy.  The most recent [hypertrophy meta](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27102172) found strong evidence that frequencies of at least twice per week were better than just once per week, but there weren't enough studies to say much about even higher frequencies.\n\nThis is the very abbreviated version.

A lot of modern running shoes stabilize your ankles and your feet a lot - and that's generally a good thing for the weak western-world feet, as unsupported shoes would lead to injury in untrained individuals.\n\nThere are plenty of runners with several years of running experience, who have super weak feet and ankles!\n\nIf you want stronger feet, you could start by integrating my warmup video into your running, sprinting or jumping routine!\n\nHere's a quick recapture of the video:\n\n* Use the routine as a warmup, or as a tendon conditioning before activities where your primary muscle groups are in the legs and feet (e.g. running, sprinting, jumping, parkour, etc).\n* For the first exercise, raise your heels off the floor, then supinate your ankles to the side. Hold for three seconds, come back the middle and back down.\n* For the second exercise, lean back until you balance on your heels, then flex your big toe and land on it with your body. Lean back again and go to the starting position.\n* Third exercise: Supinate your feet while your bodyweight rests on the outer side of your feet. Hold for three seconds, then come back. Make sure not to pronate with your knees, but with your ankles.\n* Fourth exercise: Stand on one leg and extend the other. Now pronate the leg that is in the air. Hold for three seconds, then come back to the starting position.\n* Last exercise: Just raise your toes off the floor as high as you can, while the rest of the foot is flat on the ground.\n\nHope this will help some of you. I've got some questions for you guys aswell:\n\n* Do you think it's important to strengthen your feets?\n* Have you ever tried barefoot or minimal-shoe running?\n* If yes, did you like it - or did it give you too many problems?\n\nEdit: My inbox exploded over night. Wow, thanks for all the positive (and negative) feedback. Appreciate it. I'm lacking the time to respond to every one of you right now, but I'll try at the weekend.

No idea if it's related.\n\nI get a pain in my abdomen at times. Sometimes when I lean over to one side, I get a pain in that side, and it subsides after 15-30 seconds. Not sure what that's about.\n\nMy diet the last two nights after work has been a big plate of spaghetti, with tomato sauce and beef, and a gallon of water. I bring 2 gallons of water to work, so there are no dehydration concerns.\n\nI've been stretching every muscle group before work. I should probably stretch after work as well, right? Didn't think about it until just now.\n\nAny tips would certainly be appreciated. If I had to work today, I'd be in some trouble. I may not be incredibly sore, but I'm exhausted.\n\nedit 11:30 PST: I did not anticipate this thread getting this much attention.

I know about the harm to the community by claiming all-natural and not being all-natural. It gives others a false sense of what can be accomplished in a certain amount of time, and discouraging them when aren't able to accomplish the same. I'm sure some people have felt like shit and gave up on their fitness journey because of that, and that sucks. On the inverse, how do you think it feels to have actually put in the hours the effort of eating right only to be told \"nope, your results aren't real.\" How much do you think THAT sucks? How much do you think that *helps* the community? Whatever the case, I know I'm telling the truth. If you can't take anything from this because you don't believe me, then fine. If I encouraged you to take your fitness to another level, great. I'll still answer those questions wondering about my regiment. I'm going to ignore all accusations of \"being on gear\" unless you're willing to meet up with me in LA, go with me to a drug test, then eating a dick when I come back PED-negative. Cheers.\n\n------\n\nEDIT 2: Thanks so much to the folks offering support. I hope I've inspired at least one person in some way. Answering the most common questions/comments below.\n\n* How tall are you? - I am 5'9 (Always thought I was 5'10, sadly I don't think I am lol)\n* How old are you? - I am 31, turning 32 on the 26th of November\n* How long do you spend at the gym? - About 2 hours a day. My gym has a 2-hour limit on parking, so I try to keep my workouts under 2 hours so I can move my car and take a shower/steam room without paying extra ;)\n* Why a bodybuilding split rather than a PPL? - I used to do a PPL, and while my gains came quick for strength, I am not as concerned with strength level than I am with size/aesthetic.\n* You are overtraining small muscles. - I don't feel like I am, to be honest. My arms are no longer sore after bicep / tricep days, and I feel like arm size adds a lot to my aesthetic. So I split them. Like I say below, I listen to my body - if I feel like I overtrain them, I would change; but I'm getting good results from the current split.\n* You aren't training legs enough. - This is correct. I haven't done legs regularly for my entire gym \"career\" until now. They are taking a long time to get to the pace of the rest of my muscles. When I feel like they're catching up, I will increase workload on them.\n* What do you take in terms of stack/supplements? - I take [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EE5DCT2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for pre-workout, and [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018S8L842/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for weight gainer. I take a multi-vitamin Centrum candy because I like the way it tastes, lol.\n\n-----\n\nPosted before, but lots of people asked about my routine and I wasn't able to type it out till now. Plus, I just hit my personal milestone of 160lbs!\n\nI'm sure this doesn't need to be said anymore, but this is what works for ME. Listen to your body, take what works for you from this, and ignore what doesnt.\n\n**Quick notes about myself:**\n\n* Hard gainer - my resting metabolic rate is nearly 2,000 calories.\n* I don't do ANY cardio, aside from hitting a heavy bag every now and then.\n* Been lifting on and off since I was 20, but just recently put it in high gear and dieting properly due to needs at work (I act for a living)\n* I developed an intolerance to gluten (or whatever the fuck is in things that contain gluten that make me feel like shit), so it's forced me to lay off shitty foods (McDonald's, Taco Bell, and Panda Express were staples of my diet)\n* I NEVER used to work legs, so finally giving them the attention they deserve. I will be adding exercises to leg day as I get stronger.\n\n**On overall routine:**  \nI use the body building method of working one body part a day. My overall goal is not strength, but size and appearance. However, I did throw in a deadlift day to work overall strength. Rest days come in whenever. I just listen to my body and take rest days when I feel like I need them.\n\n* Day 1 - Chest\n* Day 2 - Back\n* Day 3 - Legs\n* Day 4 - Triceps\n* Day 5 - Biceps\n* Day 6 - Shoulders\n* Day 7 - Deadlift/Abs\n\n**On exercise order:**\nI generally will start any day with more compound movements, working my way into more isolated movements. For example, chest day starts with the dumbell press, and ends with a machine flye. The idea behind this is putting more work the stabilizer muscles early, while the main muscle is still fresh and able to lift heavier weight.\n\n**On sets/reps:**  \nMy \"template\" is a 5x5. However, I am very loose with this. If I start with a weight that I can do 10 reps with, I do 10 reps. If I get to set 4 and can only do 3 reps, I will repeat that set with the same weight and do 3 more, lowering the weight on the next set. Sometimes, if I feel up to it, I will do 6 or 7 sets. It really comes down to listening to my body and adjusting accordingly. After all, my muscles don't know how many reps I did. It just knows how much work they're doing.\n\n**On diet:**  \n100%, the most immediately effective change I've made in terms of my health/physique. I don't count macros super well, but I eat relatively healthy. Due to my work schedule and inability to always have regular meals, I have also begun taking a weight gainer, which I take 3 half-servings of, spaced throughout the day. (1 serving is 1300 calories). I will add another half-serving if I miss a meal. A basic day goes as follows:\n\n* Breakfast: 2 hash browns, 4 strips of uncured turkey bacon, a LOT of egg whites (don't know how much, just pour it into the pan)\n* Half-serving of weight gainer\n* Lunch: 1/2 white, 1/2 brown Rice (can't have bread), a protein of choice (usually ground turkey, steak, chicken breast, or salmon), and broccoli\n* Half-serving of weight gainer\n* Dinner: Repeat lunch\n* Half-serving of weight gainer\n\nSnacks fit in there wherever I can fit them. I have a bag of walnuts on my desk that I munch on often.\n\n**Excercise breakdown:**  \n*Chest Day*  \n1. Flat Dumbbell Press  \n2. Incline Dumbbell Press  \n3. Flat Bench Press  \n4. Low-to-High Cable Flyes  \n5. Pec-Deck Flye -or- Cable Flyes  \n\n*Back Day*  \n1. Wide-Grip Pull-ups  \n2. Close Neutral Grip Pull-ups  \n3. Pendlay Rows  \n4. Dumbbell Rows  \n5. Dumbbell Pullovers  \n6. Neutral Grip Cable Rows  \n7. Wide Grip Lat Pulldown  \n\n*Leg Day*  \n1. Squats  \n2. Leg Press  \n3. Hamstring Curls  \n4. Calf Raises (usually many sets of this, working to a heavy weight to failure, then back down to failure)  \n\n*Tricep Day*  \n1. Close-Grip Bench Press  \n2. Skullcrushers  \n3.

A fellow redditor with a similar body type as mine was curious about my progress.

This is my first large post like this so please forgive any formatting errors.\n\nBIO:\n\nBeginning Stats (2000): 13/130ish/5'4 http://imgur.com/rjlDhyE \n\nFreshMen Year HS (2002) 15/155/5'6 http://imgur.com/24bxbQ5\n\nSenior Year HS (2006) : 18/140ish/5'7 http://imgur.com/mjMUuDV\n\nCurrent Stats (2016): 28/150/5'7 http://imgur.com/bDNiGjR\n\nHere's my fitness journey in a nutshell. Started working out around 7th grade so about 12 or 13? I was a very shy awkward Chinese kid in a predominantly  white american school. I also had the mushroom haircut to top it off LoL. I was never bullied and i had the normal amount of friends. My main problem was the females. For the life of me i could just never talk to women. I knew i wasn't good looking and my skinny and soft bod didn't help my confidence. From there i bought my first Muscle & Fitness and my life changed. I always looked up to Bruce Lee so that was the physique that was ingrained in my head. The Abercrombie & Fitch look was very popular at this time. Also Brad Pitt in \"Fight Club\" came out around this time (damn I'm old lmao) and every girl and their grandma was talking about that fight club body. (Shout out to Brad & Angelina LoL) This inspired me to have that type of physique. Abs quickly became my main focus and by far my favorite muscle to train. So it took me about 4-5 years to attain a decent physique. Around junior to senior high school i finally had decent arms and a little 4 pack. http://imgur.com/ON43ytK My nutrition at the time was very simple. Probably the average high school kid diet with more of an emphasis on protein. Honey bunches of oats cereal, trail mix, Met-rx protein bars, turkey sandwhiches, chicken patties from school, 711 hot dogs, Wendy's, McChickens, 20 piece McNuggets, rotisserie chicken, gallons of Gatorade. All i tracked was the protein. Cals were prob around 2500-3000 over 3-4 meals a day. \n\nCurrent Workut Routine: \n\nMon: Chest / Abs https://youtu.be/52u1D07Fieg  (Incline Dumbbell Press 100's)\n\nTues: Back / Legs (Squats) https://youtu.be/zexHKNGy5Zo  (Deadlift 405)\n\nWed:  Abs or Active Rest = Dance (BreakDancing) / Stretching\n\nThurs: Chest / Shoulders / Arms https://youtu.be/ENq8Qv4qp1A (225 Bench)\n\nFri: Abs or Active Rest = Dance / Stretching http://imgur.com/Mj9SYX8 (Baby Freeze)\n\nSat: Bodyweight Workouts / Calisthenics (pull ups, handstands, L sits) http://imgur.com/yutH8wE  (Flag Pole)\n\nSun: Abs or Active Rest = Dance / Stretch (Cheat Day)\n\nThe best Ab exercises (from my experience) : Full hanging leg raises (feet touch whatever you're holding), front levers, L sit holds, dragon flags (Bruce Lee style), and Ab wheel https://youtu.be/Ja4IyrjHFVg (Standing Ab wheel) My fav exercise.\n\nPersonal Records / Bulk: \n\nBench 315 x2 / Deadlift 495 x1 / OHP 225 x1 / Squat 315 x8 : All these Pr's were hit during my last bulk at a bodyweight of (160-165)  I was strong but i just felt slow and sluggish. Had no mobility and always was breathing heavily even when sitting doing nothing. I was just very unhappy. Promised myself to never go back to this weight and try to get stronger from a lower bodyweight if that's possible. I forgot to mention I'm 100% natty haha.\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/efQM0PI (160-165) Mirror selfie\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Jei6cm3 (160) Incline sitting relaxed\n\nhttp://imgur.com/hCWdFWm (160) Bench 315 sitting relaxed\n\nhttp://imgur.com/B4OsFWT (165) Most muscular pose\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Iwl0mR7 (165) Sitting relaxed\n\nhttp://imgur.com/PAmx1kc Legs / Quads\n\nCurrent Nutrition Protocol: \n\n3000-3500 Cals a day. I say nutrition instead of \"diet\" because I want people to make it a lifestyle. Any muscle you gained, gain it permanently. Any fat you lose, lose it permanently. Currently hovering around 145-150 lbs. Im very active everyday so it allows me to eat more. I literally never have an \"Off\" day where i do absolutely nothing. If I decide to skip gym and dance, I will usually just stretch at home. My stretch sessions can take up to an hour. Typical meal is white basmati rice with a protein...chicken thighs, beef / steak, shirmp, sausage. Goal is to get 150g of protein per day. Then fill the rest of the calories with carbs and fat. Cheat day is every Sunday. What i do is wake up and go dance or do abs at the gym on an empty stomach. Then I'll go for all you can eat sushi or Pho (noodles) somewhere. I don't track protein on Sunday. I also will have chips like Ruffles cheddar sour cream & a whole can of Blue Diamond wasabi almonds while watching football. Also other foods that i normally don't have during the week. Cals are prob the same, It's just that the foods are \"dirty\". It feels great not to track anything.\n\nTypical Day of 3000-3500 cals\n\n(5am) Pre-Breakfast: Black coffee or *sugar free Rockstar, Red Bull, Monster, Redline energy drink (10-20c)\n\n(6am) Breakfast: Whole eggs in coconut oil, peanut butter, 1 cup dry quick oats. Blueberries, Raisins (800c)\n\n(7am) Work: Shipping & Receiving / Loading trucks (constantly moving, good cardio LoL)\n\n(11:30am) Lunch: Chipotle steak bowl with guac (obviously) or footlong from SubWay or **(same as pwo) (800c)\n\n(3pm) Leave Work / Pre Workout: Dunkin Donuts black ice coffee or *(same as pre-breakfast, some sort of caffiene)\n\n(4pm-6pm) Workout / Train\n\n(7pm) Post Workout: **Half cup measured dry basmati rice, 10-12 oz some sort of protein in coconut oil (800c)\n\n(10pm) Dinner: **(same as post workout) (800c)\n\nSnacks: 1 serving almonds = 28 almonds, Muscle Milk shake RTD from gym, Ramen, Cereal (these vary day to day)\n\nSupplements: Absoutely drug free 100% natty. Animal Pak, Chromium, Calcium, fish oil, vitamin E, vitamin C http://imgur.com/fxUNiPY\n\nBefore & Afters: \n\nhttp://imgur.com/jYvgwZ7 (2006) Abs\nhttp://imgur.com/iYHA0dg (2016) Abs\n\nhttp://imgur.com/mjhEkOF (2006) Arms\nhttp://imgur.com/zpc7RzK (2016) Arms\n\nhttp://imgur.com/KDnLyke (2006)\nhttp://imgur.com/ls8SSIA (2016)\n\nhttp://imgur.com/MVHHY7r (2006)\nhttp://imgur.com/hCWdFWm (2015)\n\nConclusion & Things I've Learned:\n\nThe journey you go on through fitness is one hell of a ride let me tell ya. My advice is once you hit your goal weight...just start a maintenance phase and make slow gains for the rest of your life. Enjoy your new body forever.... not just for the next month then back to fatness. None of this dirty bulking crap. I cringe every time people lose a lot of weight then are like ok im done! Time to eat! Just try to add maybe 100 to 200 cals over maintenance and you will improve. I think the most I've ever weighed was prob around the 160 range. You will get stronger on a very small surplus. Just be patient. I was very impatient in the beginning. I wanted abs by next week! Never mind 4 years. Just because you don't have something now... doesn't mean you won't ever have it. The only thing separating you from abs is a couple hundred ab workouts and a deficit of a couple hundred thousand calories. The only thing separating you from being a doctor is 8-10 years of Med school. Save up 100 grand 10 times and you will be a millionaire. Once you lay it out like this your vision becomes more clear. Anything is possible. This is the logic i came up with. I used to tell myself i don't have abs \"yet\". I don't have a driver license \"yet\". I don't have a girlfriend \"yet\". As long as i knew i would be there one day that's all that mattered. There's always a future version of yourself that is depending on your actions right now. In 2 years i will be 30. That scares the shit out of me LoL. My 30 year old self is depending on the actions i make today. Procrastination is a dream killer guys. Never put things off. DO IT NOW and you'll love yourself for it. ALL THIS WILL PAY OFF ONE DAY. If you're just starting out just remember to love the process. Focus on what you're working for while enjoying working for it. There's a quote... success is just a bunch of small victories. Increasing your PR on bench by 10 lbs. It's not that much. But knowing you have never done that much in your entire life...that's a special feeling that's hard to describe. Whatever your goal is just remember that YOU WILL get there. Probably not by tomorrow. Unlikely by next week. Maybe by next month? Who knows. Who cares. All that matters is you got 1 day closer. Closer then you were 24 hrs ago. It's inevitable as long as you keep progressing pound by pound, day by day. That moment you finally take action is a win. Progress is victory. Achievement is success! You will be there one day I promise!\n\nEdit 1: \n\nWhat's up fam! Wow you guys are amazing. I'm currently at work right now about to grab the Chipotle lunch meal. I sit on this thread everyday soaking up info from you guys, and to see my journey help you in any way....means the world...extremely humbling. I'm going to edit in time stamps to the typical day to make it more clear after a brief skim through comments. Also i want to add my freshmen year high school pic. I gained a lot of fat from all the extra protein calories i was consuming. I never i mentioned i had a very low self esteem. Borderline depression through my early years. Fitness literally saved my life. http://imgur.com/24bxbQ5 (2002 Freshmen Year HS 14-15)\n\nCurrent Supplements: Yes absoutely drug free! 100% natty haha: Animal Pak, vitamin C, vitamin D vitamin E, fish oil, chromium, calcium, melatonin http://imgur.com/fxUNiPY", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Transformation Thursday! 10 Year Transformation.

With no calories outside that window.\n\nDuring the lowest calorie portion of my fast my daily meals were generally.\n\n2:00pm: Eat a chicken breast /w hotsauce and some asparagus.\n\n4:30pm: Do strength training focusing 2 muscle groups as described in the main post.\n\n6pm: Eat a chipotle burrito bowl with no cheese or sour cream, extra beans and meat. Take a fishoil and multivitamin. \nEventually I added a protein shake to this once I'd hit my weight goal.\n\nAs for the workout.  My buddy and I would generally workout 5 days a week and pick a set of two muscles that we hadn't worked on in the last two days.  Chest/Bis/Tris/Shoulders/Upper Back/Lower back or an entire day for legs.\n\nOn a non-leg day we do 3 different exercises for both muscles in sets 12,10,8,6,12 increasing weight for each successive set until the final set which is lower than the first.  The goal in choosing the amount of weight to just be able to complete the chosen amount in the set.\n\nAs of 8 months ago I started running 4 miles while in a fasted state every morning.\n\nNow that comic-con has passed I'm going to start a bulk and add 1000 calories to my diet.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "17 month progress with Comic-con as my goal", "post_ups": 2770, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3pdmcl/17_month_progress_with_comiccon_as_my_goal/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:13.604003", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Funk33", "post_created_utc": 1513541047.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "7kg002", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 299, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2759, "post_selftext": "28yrs old, 6'3.25\", SW: 253lbs CW: 205.8lbs\n\nPics:\n\nStarting: https://imgur.com/upoMd1T\n\nCurrent: https://imgur.com/a/Hnw4s\n\nI basically just counted calories.

I have no job, didn\u2019t go to school (am 20 years old) and really had no motivation to do anything besides sit in my room. I wouldn\u2019t classify it as depression but I did suffer from social anxiety.\n\nOn one instance, I was in public and my social anxiety went CRAZY. If anyone has experienced anxiety, you know the one thing you want is an ESCAPE. I lied to the receptionist (was waiting for an appointment) just so I could go outside to \u201clock my car\u201d. That was the moment I said, \u201cfuck this I\u2019m not dealing with this anymore.\u201d\n\nBegan scowling reddit for any fitness advice. I found great advice on breathing properly when exercising, pacing yourself, what not to do, how to PROPERLY rest. I found a handy app called C25K and began running, every single morning. At first it was brutal. I hadn\u2019t woke up that early (5am) in over a year, I hadn\u2019t ran for over a year, let alone exercise. My legs were shaking and I\u2019d only run/walk for 2 miles.\n\nThere was no motivation, that\u2019s the one thing some people might disagree with me on. Motivation gets you hyped up for a couple minutes, maybe an hour. Other than that couple of minutes, motivation is bullshit. What pushes me is that I remind myself is that there\u2019s an end to what I\u2019m doing, no matter what happens, there is an end. Yeah you might feel like death, but you\u2019ll be able to tell yourself you got through it. That\u2019s all that matters and that is what I had to remind myself every single morning in 20 degree weather.\n\nThe combination of waking up early and starting my day off accomplished more than I could ever imagine. I have lost 19 pounds and now weigh the appropriate weight for my height, something I haven\u2019t been for the last 6 years. It has hardened my mental image of myself. I have shown discipline and strength in pushing myself. It has practically cured my anxiety, it has given me the energy to have an excellent day regardless of what happens. It has convinced me to go back to college, it has helped me get back into the social swing of things. There has been nothing but positives and all I had to do was decide to get the fuck up and try.\n\nMaybe someone may find this motivating but the purpose is to show you that I did it. I haven\u2019t even started my real goals but I\u2019m on the way! You just need to try it, if you fail at a certain point, it is now a baseline. Your baseline if you never try is nothing!\n\nTL:DR - running 3 miles a day and waking up at 5am every day has cured my social anxiety, given me more value in life, convinced me to go back to college, and live a overall better life", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "How exercising changed my life thanks to /r/fitness", "post_ups": 2750, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/a8rrxk/how_exercising_changed_my_life_thanks_to_rfitness/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:13.604003", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "theresavh1", "post_created_utc": 1377053071.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1377147041.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "1ks208", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 222, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2745, "post_selftext": "http://imgur.com/h90qgjv\n\nMy before and after, I know I still have a long way to go.

This post will cover the bare essentials. I see people asking, and I get asked how to run faster all the time. I am going to try and provide a bare minimum of solid background and combine it with the practical how-to steps for running faster. I will strongly lean on two of the most credible sources of running literature I know of: Daniel's Running Formula, 3E and The Lore of Running (Noakes). These books have a sterling reputation and represent the best of the science and accumulated anecdotal wisdom of the running world. \n\nThere is no one \"accepted\" training plan. Even among experts there is a lot of variation. However, at the core there are certain key workouts that almost all elites use. I will focus on these basics and how you can incorporate them into a running program to run faster. \n\nWho is this guide for? Anyone who wants to run faster. Specifically, you should be willing to dedicate about four to five hours per week to running and it should be the focus of your training program. You can and should do resistance training, but I am just going to focus on people who want their primary exercise to be running. \n\n# Why do some people run faster?\nFirst, it is important to understand why an elite endurance athlete can perform the way they perform. Why can two runners follow an exact regimen of exercise, diet, and sleep and have dramatically different running performances? \n\n* Biomechanics -- Some runners are more efficient and can go faster at a given level of energy expenditure\n* Oxygen -- Some runners (VO2 Max) can just suck more oxygen into their bodies\n* Blood -- Some runners have more hemoglobin and can do more with less oxygen\n* Lactate Turnpoint -- How quickly do you accumulate lactate in your blood at a given intensity and the inflection point of when it increases dramatically\n\nBob, this is complicated, what the heck does this all mean? Simply put, this can be very easily thought of as running economy. For a given amount of oxygen consumption, how fast can you run? The answer to this question is your \"running economy\" and it is a key concept. The bad news, your VO2 max is close to set in stone and even if you train really hard for a long time you will not be able to increase how much oxygen you consume by very much. Genetically, some people are low and high responders to training so there is some variance, but not a lot. Alas, do not despair, you can still train all these other systems I mentioned and become a much, much faster runner. \n\n\"The best athletes are usually the most economical athletes (Noakes 1988).\" -- Lore of running. Noakes is also a proponent that running economy is hugely important, possibly more so than VO2 Max. \n\n# All about that base\nSo, if you can't improve your VO2 Max, you are training something else to go faster. The overview is simple. You have to start running, probably more than you are. Runners that run more miles in training increase their economy. There is a lot we don't know about running economy, but, basically, you need to run a lot. We aren't talking about intensity or anything like that yet. How much you can run depends on where you are as a runner. The goal is to slowly increase the mileage your body can tolerate. \n\nIdeally you can run at least 4 times per week 2-6 miles at an easy pace. If you can't that is ok, this advice and knowledge works just fine for you as well! **Easy**, meaning you can still carry on a conversation and on perceived effort scale of 1-5 you are chilling out at 2. For 3-4 weeks, you should do a bulk of easy running with no hard efforts. This prepares your body and gives you a \"mileage base\" or \"fitness base\" to work from. It encourages a tremendous number of beneficial adaptations and gets your body ready to do harder efforts without becoming injured. For untrained runners 4-12 weeks of easy running might even be beneficial. You, basically, want to do easy running as long as your fitness is improving (and as long as you can stand it). \n\nOnce your improvement levels off with the amount of easy running you can do, it is time to sharpen. And to understand sharpening we will first look at the systems we target when we perform harder running efforts. Let me also say that, if you are a starting runner and find running more than 2-3 miles too difficult, try fast walking. Our goal is to work at 75-80% of our max heart rate (usually a 2 on the perceived effort scale). If you can do that with fast (15:00 walking), do that! You can also cycle between running and walking in the same exercise, just realize you are probably doing something that is \"high intensity\" to your body if you are just starting running. \n\n# What is lactate?\nMany people talk about lactic acid. Few people bother to learn what we have studied about it. I will talk about lactate as lactate threshold is something that gets used a lot in training plans (threshold runs). Lactate, not lactic acid, is a product of glycolysis. Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose precursors into pyruvate. Pyruvate (or possibly just pure lactate) is then used by your body as energy (not quite, but close enough for our purposes). This happens in both the aerobic and \"anaerobic\" energy systems. As exercise intensity increases, blood lactate increases. The more carbs you burn the more lactate you get. That is what lactate in your blood means. \n\n\"Lactate is a key fuel in the body for exercise. Lactate does not cause fatigue, muscle craps, the stitch, or post exercise muscle soreness (Brooks 1998).\" -- Lore of Running. You produce lactate as a result of carbohydrate metabolism. You can observe lactate in the blood, gauge your carb burn rate and make some meaningful guesses about an individual's running performance.\n\n# What about fat as energy? \nAt any race pace faster than half marathon pace you don't really use fat as energy at a significant level. You can't really adapt your lactate turning point maximally training at slower paces. If burning fat is your goal the slower you go, to a point, the more energy you use from fat, but it is a more complicated process than the anaerobic glycolysis we just discussed. We won't go further here, but you do use fat as fuel at lower intensities. \n\n# Lactate Turnpoint and Other Adaptations\nBasically, there is an amount of blood lactate present right when you cross from mild exercise to more intense exercise. This amount, when graphed creates a sort of visual \"Lactate Turnpoint\". The observation, which turns out to be quite accurate is that, \"the exercise intensity that can be sustained for 42km (Marathon-ish Distance) is very close to the intensity at which blood lactate concentrations first begin to rise above values present during mild exercise.\" So, the idea is that if we can increase our pace at the point at which this turn point occurs, we can increase our overall timed running performance on longer efforts. \n\nUnfortunately lactate turn point is relatively difficult to measure and not of practical use, other than as a theoretical underpinning based on the types of training that increase it. Other useful adaptations occur with high intensity training, but this is one of the key ones that occurs. Many, many other beneficial adaptations occur: Liver glycogen stores increase, the mitochondria in your body adapt, your body grows more capillaries, you can increase your VO2 Max some of the time, you use more fat and decrease glycogen used during exercise at all work rates. Basically, a lot of good things happen. \n\n# High Intensity Training\nWhen I talk about high intensity training I am thinking of training that is at 3-5 on a perceived effort scale. What types of high intensity running are there and what do they accomplish?\n\n* Sprinting -- Anaerobic, improves biomechanics, foot turnover and certain metabolic adaptations\n* Intense Intervals -- Maximum effort you can sustain for 200-1600 meters, repeated a number of times in a workout. Increases lactate turn point, running economy. Improves muscle glycogen usage. \n* Tempo Intervals -- Maximum effort you can sustain for 1-6 miles. As a beginner tempo work is usually a couple of miles with a break in the middle. \n* \"Marathon\" pace and work that is harder than easy. Think 2.5-3.5 on the intensity scale\n* Easy pace -- 1.5-2 on the perceived effort scale. 70-80% of the miles you will likely run.\n\nGenerally, after you have a base under your feet and you are gearing up for a timed event of some sort, you should spend 18-12 weeks in a running program that incorporates Sprinting, Intense Intervals and Tempo Intervals, along with your bulk of easy running. The longer your race effort (Marathon, for example) the more you might emphasize long tempo work. The shorter (say a 2 mile military PT time trial) the more you want to focus on Sprinting and Intense Intervals. However, don't think that because you are running a marathon intense intervals don't belong in your training program. The adaptations that occur there will make you a faster marathoner (See: lactate turn point we talked about earlier). Or, an anecdotal view point: The fastest 5K and 10K runners also tend to be the fastest marathoners. \n\n# Building a training program\nAt this point we can build a simple training program. You don't even really need me to tell you more, we have laid out most of the first principles. A good training program for runners with 1-3 years of experience incorporates the following: \n\n * Rest weeks, weeks where intensity drops. Usually every 3rd or 4th week. Prevents overtraining. Good practice unless you really know your body and what you are doing\n * A base phase of 4-12 weeks of easy running only\n * Intervals and Tempo work tuned to your desired distance\n * Sprints and other economy drills (strides, butt-kicks, and other small things). Sprints are very short, BTW, about 50-60 meters at level 5 on the intensity scale. Do 3-8 of them to finish off an easy run. Rest completely after each one so that it is intense but in no way a real challenge\n\n# OK, but Bob you haven't told me enough details!\nOkay. I am sorry. At this point we have just covered what many books have covered, but we had to skip a lot of practical details. So, let's build a running program for a hypothetical runner. Her name is Jill. She wants to run a really fast two miles for a military PT exam. She has 12 weeks to prepare. She can generally run 5 miles at an easy pace. She has come to me to help coach her and build a training plan. The first thing I will have Jill do is run an all out 5K. An all out 5K is an excellent predictor of running fitness. To figure out training paces, always run an all out mile or 5K. The longer the distance you can run all out, the more accurate the training paces will be. \n\nNext I bang along through my Daniels Running Formula book, figuring Jill will run about 20-25 miles per week over about 4 to 5 runs. I want Jill to do track repeats (Intervals) and Tempo work. You can use tables like those found in Daniels or tools like this one (http://www.runnersworld.com/tools/training-paces-calculator). You can also find Daniel's formula in spreadsheets. Let's say Jill ran a 25:00 5K. Her easy run pace will be in the neighborhood of 10:00-11:00/mi, but we just let whatever feels good (2.0/5.0 on effort scale) dictate her easy run pace. We will have her run two \"Quality\" runs each week. \n\nFirst: 3 repeats at threshold (turn point) pace, one mile in length each. Roughly 8:30 pace. Warm up 10 minutes. Cool down 10 minutes. Easy pace for warm-up and cool down. Rest for one minute in between each repeat. \n\nSecond: 1K repeats. 6 of them. Slightly faster than threshold pace. Call it 8:15. Because Jill is a beginner we have a choice to make here. We could have her run at her interval pace, but we can probably get the same adaptation sticking around her threshold pace. So we aim for work that is a little more intense, but in a 1K repeat format. \n\nAs time goes on we keep one of the threshold runs, perhaps increasing the total distance ran at threshold pace. Then we take the workout that was 1K repeats and may slowly increase the pace to be closer to interval pace as her fitness improves. Realistically it doesn't matter a lot! We have to monitor Jill's progress and see how she is feeling as she does this work. We also advise Jill to do one longer run of 40-50 minutes every week. Whatever mileage is left over after quality work and a longer effort is run spread out however Jill likes in easy runs. \n\nFinally, the week before she runs her fitness test we have her half all of the mileage, but keep the same intensity of everything she is doing. No hard efforts for 2 days before the test to get optimum recover from any hard efforts. If Jill stuck with the program she is almost assured a new personal record in her fitness test.\n\nIf Jill completes this program successfully she could take a few weeks and do easy running and then tackle a more structured, advanced program with more quality work.  \n\n# Training Intensity Table\n\nFrom \"Which comes first: Cardio or Weights? (Hutchinson)\"\n\nZone | Aerobic | Threshold | Anaerobic\n:--|:--|:--|:--\nTraining Time | 70% | 20% | 10%\nHeart Rate | Below 80% of max | 80-90% of max | Above 90% of max\nTalk Test | Complete sentences | A few words at a time | Single Words\nWorkouts | 20-60 minutes steady | Surges of 3-10 minutes | Short bursts of 0.5-3 minutes\n\n# I didn't talk about nutrition and diet\nDon't be afraid of carbs. You can also eat a high fat diet. Whatever sort of diet you choose, be very consistent. The goal is to ensure we have enough glycogen in our livers and in our muscles to perform optimally. This requires carbohydrates. It is highly dependent on the length of the endurance effort. Below an hour, just eat normally, and maybe have an extra bit of carbs. There are also studies that show you can eat a low carb, high fat diet for about 5-6 days and see no negative effect on your performance. However, before 5-6 days your body is getting used to a high-fat diet, and your performance will suffer. \n\nBasically, there is a lot we don't know about the specific reasons. But, what we do know is that you should eat consistently and don't change things up much before a time trial or race. Carb loading has been studied intensely according to Dr. Noakes. So if you eat Paleo / high fat, just stick to that for at least 5 days before any endurance performance. And if you eat normal levels of carbs, just don't mess with it, in fact, you might even consider loading the carbs up a bit to top off any glycogen stores. Do I really need to tell you the rest? Eat your vegetables, lots of them. Make sure you have plenty of micro-nutrients in your diet. \n\n# The mental game\nI would be remiss if I did not talk about the mental aspects of running. Running can be a very mental game. You should try to run (or even ride your bike) over as much of any course you plan to run as possible. Mental toughness takes you a long way during racing efforts. The best runners are the ones that have all the right physical traits and the mental toughness to endure suffering and are motivated to do so.\n\n# Conclusion\nYou are still reading? We have covered the basics of how to run faster. I left out so much of the science, and I simplified a lot, so don't skewer me for this. You will still have to do your own research on training plans, but now you have enough knowledge that you should be able to build a good training plan. There are good training plan calculators out there. The key thing is to run an all out 1mi or 5K effort and ensure that your training program has you running at threshold and potentially interval pace when you are sharpening. Eat clean. Be consistent. Good luck! If you want to run faster than you have to run faster, and more often. \n\n\n# EDIT: What threshold and interval workouts look like\nI wanted to give a quick overview of some typical threshold and interval workouts since I said they were pretty important and I answered a few questions in thread. Threshold work is also often called tempo work. You will see this as 1-2 mile repeats (or 3 miles at a slightly less intense pace). Elites will even run more miles at threshold, training for marathons (6-10 is not unheard of). Running calculators using a recent race will give you a good pace to work from here. You usually want 2-4 miles of threshold work in a threshold workout. You can do it in one or two mile repeats when you are starting out. Always warm up and cool down. \n\nIntervals are often done at much shorter distances and you can mix and match. You want to aim for about 4-5K of distance at interval pace. So you might see, 400x12, 800x6, 1000x5, 1200x6, or (1200, 800, 1200, 800, 1200), etc. You tend to run a little faster on shorter intervals (helps improve running form to go faster) and a little slower in the longer 1K-ish, but its still all \"close\" to interval pace. After each repeat you take a rest. The longest you want to work at interval pace is about 5 minutes. According to Daniels, you can take a pretty long rest when your interval is 5 minutes in length. For shorter intervals aim for 90-120 seconds. There is a bit of a method to figuring out your ideal rest, but basically, you want to be able to finish the last rep at the same pace as the first without dying. If you can't, decrease the pace next time, but keep your rest interval the same. \n\n\n# EDIT 2: Can you improve your VO2 Max? \n\nYES! You can. /u/bananafreesince93 correctly points out that VO2 max can be increased, through training, anywhere from 10%-30%. Interval training will target your VO2 max improvement the best. I didn't mean to be too glib saying it was \"set in stone\", but of all the things you can influence through training VO2 max is one of the hardest and its quite possible to be a low responder to VO2 max training (10% doesn't move the needle very far). Lactate threshold is more sensitive to training than VO2 max, and that is what I wanted to focus on. :) \n\n# Key Books\nLore of Running (4E), Noakes\n\nDaniels' Running Formula (3E), Daniels\n\nThe Science of Running: How to find your limit and train to maximize your performance, Steve Magness\n\n# Resources\n[Daniels' Formula Spreadsheet] (http://www.electricblues.com/archive/DanielsTables3-00-00.xls) -- This thing is sort of a monster, but if you plug in a recent race time and or time trial along with your age and weight it will give you a /lot/ of detailed information. It is quite handy. A good bit of it won't make a lot of sense without the Daniels' Formula books, but it will still be useful to see training paces, etc. Daniels' was one of the first to popularize the approach of providing a race time and then using tables to figure out training paces. Almost any training schedule type app you see will be giving you training paces very similar to what comes out of this spreadsheet.

I wasn't counting but I was probably eating an average of about 1500 calories a day and I blamed my inability to gain weight on my \"fast metabolism\". From the ages of 8-15 I was a very active tennis player, but after that I pretty much stopped doing any intense physical activity. I went to my university gym a couple times and played around with some machines, thinking if I did that for a week without any change to my diet I would suddenly see noticeable results. Obviously nothing happened and I went back to my sedentary lifestyle.\n\nAt the beginning of 2017, one of my coworkers and good friends /u/sp00nzhx got me into lifting, showed me how to squat/deadlift/bench/ohp etc, and encouraged me to start eating a lot more. On January 23rd I started eating 2500+ calories a day and going to the gym three days a week. Eventually I started keeping track of my weight and calories with this TDEE spreadsheet: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8EbfzFB0mBrMGJ6V2N5QWNfeTg/view \n\n\n\n**Workout Routine**\n\nI started off with **Stronglifts 5x5** and did that for six months until I had a 195 lb squat, 245 lb deadlift, and 170 lb bench. This program is great for building noob gains, especially in strength, and it is very simple and easy to follow. However due to the lack of accessory movements I wouldn't recommend it to someone else for any more than your first six months of lifting, especially if your goal is just to build muscle.\n\nAfter Stronglifts I moved on to **The Muscle Building Routine** by AWorkoutRoutine (four day/week upper-lower split). While I did continue making very good muscle and strength gains on this program I personally didn't find doing so many accessory movements to be very satisfying, and I mostly liked doing the main barbell movements and getting stronger in them. I spent another three months on this routine, ending with a 275 lb squat, 300 lb deadlift, and 175 lb bench (very bad bench plateau).\n\nAfter this was a bit of a dark time when I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do and was experimenting with a bunch of stuff. I tried Nsuns 6 day program for a few weeks but didn't enjoy it, so I was mostly just doing powerlifting movements and constantly maxing out my squat and deadlift. This caused my form to start deteriorating and my body began to fall apart. I ended this period around the beginning of December with a 325 lb squat, 335 lb deadlift, and 215 lb bench.\n\nMidway through December I decided I might want to start taking powerlifting or weightlifting more seriously as a sport and started my first cycle of Smolov Squats. I have only been doing back squats for the past six weeks and I am halfway through this current cycle. It is extremely difficult but the squat gains are very apparent and have a lot of carryover to my deadlift and front squat. As of today I have a 355 lb squat (with knee wraps), a 355 lb deadlift (conventional), and a 225 lb bench. My goals for the future are mostly to get stronger in the powerlifting moves and to learn olympic weightlifting. I'm hoping to hit a 405 lb squat and a 405 lb deadlift by the beginning of my fall semester at the end of August.\n\n\n\n**Diet**\n\nI'm a lifelong vegetarian so that limited my options a bit (no meat or fish). In my time dirty bulking I would eat/drink a lot of peanut butter and jelly/banana sandwiches, bean burritos, milk, protein shakes, chips, soda/energy drinks, that sort of stuff. Anything that would put protein and calories in me. Over time I've mostly cleaned up my diet. A sample day might look like this:\n\nBreakfast:\n3 Cups Milk: 450 C/24g P\nBanana: 120C/1g P\nOther Fruits: ~100C/1g P\n6g Fish Oil: 60C\nDaily Supplements\nTotal: 730C & 26g P\n\nPost-Workout:\nGatorade (During Workout): 200 C\n1 Cup Milk: 150 C/8g P\n3 scoops Protein Powder: 360 C/72g P\n7.5g Creatine Powder\nBanana: 120C/1g P\nTotal: 830C & 81g P\n\nDinner #1:\n2 Cups Cooked Rice: 520 C/15g P\n1 Can Kidney Beans: 420 C/25g P\nTotal: 940 C & 40g P\n\nDinner #2:\n1.5 Cups Milk: 225 C/12g P\nDessert (Cake/Pie): 380C/4g P\nTotal: 605 C & 16g P\n\nTotal: 3105 Calories & 163g Protein\n\nI like to keep things simple so I don't mix it up often. Supplements i take are multi-vitamins, fish oil, creatine, magnesium, and vitamin C.\n\n\n\n**Summary**\n\nBesides the basics (be movited, calories, protein, sleep blah blah blah), there are a few secondary things that I think I'd always tell someone, especially for someone just getting into bodybuilding/strength training, that aren't talked about as often.\n\nDon't be afraid of carbs. Put a lot of emphasis on mobility. Don't test your one-rep max more than once a month. Do not forget micronutrients. Make friends at the gym. Enjoy the process, not just the results.\n\nI look forward to updating you all in another year!", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "M/19/5'7\" - One Year Progress - (115 lb to 150 lb) + (S: 355; B: 225; D: 355)", "post_ups": 2734, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7srq5l/m1957_one_year_progress_115_lb_to_150_lb_s_355_b/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:13.604003", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "whatswrongwithmytree", "post_created_utc": 1359556060.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "17k88l", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 491, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2731, "post_selftext": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POdzasJklxw\n\nI thought everyone here would enjoy this.

I started at 261 lbs and got down to [200 lbs](https://imgur.com/a/tbbj8N9). I then bulked to 230. Following the bulk I cut down to 210 and put on some muscle to get to 215. I am 25 years old now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How Did I Lose The Weight?**\n\nHIIT (High Intensity Interval Training)!!! I cannot stress enough how effective this is. My favorite form of HIIT is sprints. They are simple to do and you can do them pretty much anywhere when there is decent weather. At the beginning I would go to a track at a school by my house and then once I got more comfortable with myself I just did them on my quiet street. I ran the straightaways on the track and walked the turns, and did a total of 8 straightaways to start and eventually worked up to 12 a workout. On my street I would sprint what I thought was about 100 meters and then walked back to where I started from and go again. I would do this anywhere from 8-12 total times depending on how I was feeling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn each leg day I do a variation of HIIT for 10-15 minutes at the end of my workouts, which I do to stay lean and keep my physique. I know I could be much stronger if I were to lower the cardio, but I love looking good as well. I also play hockey once or twice a week for extra cardio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Programming**\n\nAs of right now I have been running Candito's Six Week Strength program for the past \\~2 years and it has been working great. It allows me to work on my three big lifts while adding in some body building exercises at the end. My main focus is to stay lean, but build strength at the same time, which can be very difficult at times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, I joined my college's power lifting team. I used Candito's program to peak for my first meet back in November.. I have another competition coming up in February, but I am going to switch up my programming a little. I will be running Smalov to get my squat up for the next meet as I find it is falling behind my other lifts.  Along with Smalov I will be running Candito's 6 week program for bench as I have seen great results with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Meet Lifts**\n\n445 Squat,\n\n325 Bench\n\n562 Dead weighing in at 212 lb\n\nCame 3rd place in my class!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Diet**\n\nBreakfast: 5 eggs, Greek yogurt\n\nPre-workout meal: Can of tuna, banana\n\nPost-workout meal: Chicken and rice, protein shake\n\nDinner: Some kind of meat with a few carbs (Try and have most of my carbs pre and post workout)\n\nSnacks: Protein shake and handful of nuts or seeds, can of tuna and high protein cereal with milk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Where to go from here?**\n\nI am always looking for positive feedback or input on what I could do to improve my physique or strength.

I started off with just 3 full body workouts a week and am now on PPL 6 day program, but using a form of 531 for my main lifts.\n\n**Routine:**\n\nI go to the gym usually 5 days a week running a 6-day PPL program but I just continue on the next week starting from the 6th day. \n\n**DAY1: Push A**\n\n-Bench press 5 - 3 - 1 style, so reps change every week.\n\n-Overhead press 5 - 3 - 1.\n\n-Incline dumbbell press 3x8-12\n\n-Seated lateral raise 4x12-15\n\n-Weighted dips - 4x8\n\n-OH Tricep extension 3x8-12\n\n\n**DAY2: Pull**\n\n-Deadlifts 5-3-1\n\n-Weighted Pullups 3x5\n\n-Dumbell rows 3x8-12\n\n-Facepulls 3x12-15\n\n-EZ Bar curls 3x8-12\n\n-DB Rear Delt Flies 3x12-15\n\n-Hammer curls 3x8-12\n\n\n**DAY3: Legs**\n\n-Squats 5-3-1\n\n-Front squat 4x8\n\n-Hip thrusts 4x8\n\n-Leg Curl 4x8-12\n\n-Calf raises 4-12-15\n\n-Lunges 4x 8-12\n\nThe rest of the days are Push, Pull and legs again with some variation, doing lighter lifts and more reps for the main lifts. Don't want to make the post too long. I also do a decent amount of calisthenics training on the side with a long-term goal of full planche which I'm training for.\n\n**Supplements**\n\nI only use creatine nowadays, will start taking protein shakes when I have some more spare money\n\n**Diet**\n\nMy diet is definitely one of the things that I need to improve on, I tracked my calories at the start but haven't in a while, until the other week where I have started again. For me, it's really hard to gain weight without tracking my calories properly.\n\n\n**Ending words**\nI still want to gain a lot more weight until I am fully comfortable with how my body looks, I want to be around 160 lbs, I just want to stay lean.\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "1 Year Progress", "post_ups": 2724, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8pgb3k/1_year_progress/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:13.604003", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "maester_ia", "post_created_utc": 1460301011.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1460301262.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "4e6435", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 449, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2721, "post_selftext": "I know there's a lot of new people here who are just getting started with exercise, and I wrote something that might be useful.

I tried multiple times to \"work out\" and lose the eighty pounds that I gained beginning in college, but I always stopped. It wasn't until years later that I realized I'd had it all wrong. Cycling taught me that exercise can be fun. *Joyful*. A form of play, as the late Dr. George Sheehan often said. I've since come to feel similarly about running; it's a form of liberation, and it's an essential part of my life. \n\n[Here's the link if you're interested.](http://frankbeard.org/2016/04/09/what-i-misunderstood-about-exercise-when-i-was-fat/) ", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "What I misunderstood about exercise when I was fat", "post_ups": 2721, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4e6435/what_i_misunderstood_about_exercise_when_i_was_fat/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:13.604003", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "SkywayTraffic", "post_created_utc": 1468508549.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "4stp03", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 2038, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2718, "post_selftext": "So yeah, I figured this would be cool to talk about.

I looked and felt amazing, and got a lot of positive feedback (and more valuable advice).\n\nI was originally planning on lean bulking from 172, but took a user's advice and instead maintained for a few weeks, before going on a cut once more to lose even more fat and keep pushing the envelope. I had already achieved a personal record of leanness and aesthetics, so every pound lost beyond that felt even better as I was setting new records day by day, week by week.\n\nOnce I got to 170lb, I decided to go from a -1000 calorie deficit into running a PSMF cycle for a few weeks. PSMF, for those that don't know, stands for \"Protein-sparing modified fast\", and is a crash diet meant to be run for short periods of time. You eat very low calories, most of it being protein, and do a full-body routine 2-3 times per week to maintain. More information on this is covered in The Rapid Fat-loss Handbook, by Dr. Lyle McDonald.\n\nI got to a PR low of 160lb (on the sixth) and then began a lean-bulk, after doing a carb refeed over the weekend. My weight is currently at 166lb, I am now planning on leanbulking for 11 more weeks and then seeing where I want to go from there. My goals are now to get strong, so I am running the classic NSuns five day routine, and also pack more muscle mass on certain parts that I feel are lagging behind, like pecs.\n\nTo elaborate, here's a list of what my diet would've been like during the PSMF.\n\n**DIET**\n\n**During the PSMF, this is what I ate on a typical day.**\n\nBreakfast: A scoop of whey protein blended in with ice and freshly brewed coffee.\n\nLunch: Chicken breast, of varying weight. Let's say 150-200g, based off of what I pulled out of the bag that day.\n\nDinner: Eggs, and tilapia. The tilapia's weight varied, just as the chicken breast's weight would.\n\nSnacks: I liked to blend ice, egg whites, and protein powder in a bullet blender, for some protein \"italian ice\". Also, single servings or cottage cheese or greek yogurt.\n\n**When I was cutting at a -500 deficit, this was a typical day.**\n\nBreakfast: Four eggs, 1 tbsp of peanut butter, one 40g serving of oats, 4 oz of milk/4 oz of water added to oats, and a scoop of whey as well\n\nLunch: 150g of skinless, boneless chicken breast. Another 40g of oatmeal, this time a more savory variety with tsp of salt added, along with a 28g serving of shredded cheese. I also added 4oz milk/4 oz water.\n\nDinner: My dinner was just a shake, so another scoop of whey and 8 oz of milk. An hour or two after, before bed I would eat a serving of cottage cheese or greek yogurt.\n\n**Lean bulk diet**\n\nBreakfast: Four eggs, 56g of dry black beans (cooked, I meal prep the beans and boil 5 servings as a time, then divide the cooked product by 5). 28g shredded cheese added to the eggs, and a serving of cottage cheese that I use to top four slices of toast w/ jam.\n\nLunch: I skipped lunch here, ate a 400 calorie cinnamon roll (lol).\n\nDinner: 205g chicken breast, 85g of peas, 145g of broccoli. \n\nSnack: 80g of oats, 1tbsp of peanut butter, 8 fl oz of milk, and one scoop of whey mixed together, along with a tbsp of maple syrup.\n\nThat ends up being about 2,000 calories logged into MFP, plus the 400 calorie cinnamon roll. 2,400 calories, 160g of protein. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Exercise**\n\nDuring the PSMF portion of my cut, I followed a two day full body split.\n\nExercise, sets, reps\n\nSquat or leg press 2-3 6-8\n\nRDL or leg curl 1-2 6-8\n\nBench press or 2-3 6-8\n\nIncline DB press Rowing or chins 2-3 6-8\n\nLateral raise 1-2 8-10\n\nBiceps 1-2 8-10\n\nTriceps 1-2 8-10\n\nWeighted crunch 1-2 6-8\n\nBack extension 1-2 6-8\n\n**Pictures**\n\nFinally, here are the pics. I'll include the albums from the previous thread for your convenience, reader.\n\n[Starting pics, in Sept 2017. Warning: FAT](http://imgur.com/a/ftcRUfq)\n\n[January. Warning: FATTER.](http://imgur.com/a/cQDEPud) I made the mistake of bulking when I should have cut. (January 2018)\n\n[August 2018. Felt great. Wanted to look even better.](http://imgur.com/a/fewF2bD)\n\n**AND NOW.**\n\n[October 2018](https://imgur.com/a/hdjHJUg)\n\nI took these over the course of a week. Some were taken on the morning of October 6th, when I was about 160. I liked how I looked in certain pics, but didn't like the look of others. So I waited a week, after carb loading and lean bulking, to take pics in poses like the front double biceps. So in some pics I'm 160, and in some im 165 (dat dere water weight).\n\nThanks for reading, fittit. <3", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Have visible abs for the first time in my life and I feel amazing (187->200->172->160->165)", "post_ups": 2710, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9o3uj5/have_visible_abs_for_the_first_time_in_my_life/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:13.604003", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "", "post_created_utc": 1391980918.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "1xgn8m", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 421, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2706, "post_selftext": "Is there a difference between the two?

Before we get into the transformation I want to give this message to all those in the transformation process. Transforming yourself on the inside is as important if not more so than making the physical transformation. I'll get into this again later, but for me, my physical transformation was just a catalyst for my later inner transformation. And **it wasn't until I changed the way I perceived myself, the world, and life in general that my life REALLY change.** \n\nYou can be the biggest/most ripped guy on the planet, but without a good inner base of confidence you will never feel complete/whole.\n\n**My Transformation**\n\n* I grew up as a skinny little kid. Didn't pass 100lbs until I was 15. Took weight lifting in High School but wasn't very serious about it. Put on a decent amount of muscle for a High Schooler but I was still skinny as hell. [Here's me at 18 in 2005, about 145-150lbs](http://imgur.com/a/OwgIF#0)\n\n* Went to college and made getting big my NUMBER one goal. Didn't party, didn't socialize, didn't do sh*t but lift and read about lifting and playing MMOs(because I was very socially awkward, unconfident, and felt that if I could get big then I could get girls.) Put on about 20lbs that year, bench went from 205 to 255, didn't do a single squat that year hah. [Here's me at 175lbs in the Summer of 2006](http://imgur.com/a/OwgIF#1)\n\n* From the fall of 2006 to the end of 2008 I took bulking VERY seriously, and I learned more about proper lifting. Primarily followed Madcow's 5x5 program and gained a ton of strength/size. Also gained a ton of fat as I was eating some ridiculous meals to put on size. A typical dinner for me consisted of at least 350g carbs and 16oz of meat. I seriously think I made myself insulin resistant to the point of being border-line type 2 diabetic in this period. At the end of that time I had terrible energy swings, would literally fall unconscious after large dinners. But I gained size! And fat... [Was 215 at the end of 2008](http://imgur.com/a/OwgIF#2)\n\n* I started my cut in the Winter of 2008 and that lasted all the way until the fall of 2009. I tried EVERY diet. 40/40/20, velocity diet(where your only source of calories are from 5 protein shakes a day for 28 days- **terrible, never do this**), carb cycling, keto, high fat, low fat, high carb, low carb. You name it, I tried it. Settled on keto and carb cycling as the most effective for me. Dropped down to 187, lost quite a bit of strength, definitely lost some muscle mass(especially during velocity diet). [Here is me at the end of that cut, fall of 2009](http://imgur.com/a/OwgIF#4)\n\n* Today I am a healthy 195. I've been at this weight for the last two years. This seems to be a good homeostasis point. I like the weight because I can be strong/big and yet still pretty athletic(I'm in the Army so I need to be able to run). [A shot of my legs in Sept 2012.](http://imgur.com/a/OwgIF#6) [Just for fun, here's a video I just uploaded of doing 102 reps of Squats with 225lbs in 29 minutes.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGUQXxUDxjE) I'm a firm believer that squats and deads are fundamental to developing a well-rounded physique. GO SQUAT! Also for anyone interested, I made a [NASM study guide](http://www.thehealthygamer.com/free-comprehensive-nasm-study-guide-pass-your-cpt/) which could be useful information on learning more in-depth ideas about training.\n\n* [A video I made of my transformation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pRDBtgdhoM)\n\n* [Link to a more detailed write-up of my transformation](http://www.thehealthygamer.com/2013/02/12/the-transformation-of-a-nerdy-asian-gamer/)\n\nNow let me talk about inner change. After I got \"ripped\" in 2009 I realized that life didn't change much. Sure I got more attention from people and girls, but I still felt unconfident. I still sucked with women. I still was shy and timid. **Note- I realize getting girls is not the sole purpose of life, but for someone in their 20's it is still a very important issue- especially if you CAN'T attract the kind of women you want to date, and that's why I keep hitting on that issue.**\n\nThat's when I really got serious with self development. Read a ton of books and worked on my inner being. A few examples of exercises I did- I would walk around and force myself to hold eye-contact with every person walking by me on campus(insanely difficult at first!). I consciously talked louder. I made myself aware of how my body language was at all times. Little things like that, which over time, really helped me to grow confident in myself.\n\nToday I absolutely love life. I love it and I live it with zeal. I've been able to land great jobs because of my confidence and social skills developed over the last few years. I've started my own business that brings in about 1k a month after 8 months. I was able to do this because of the confidence I gained and the realization that anything is possible with disciplined hard work.\n\n**So my message to all of you is that you can change EVERYTHING about yourself. You can change your appearance, and you can change your attitude toward life. You can change your limiting beliefs. You can change how people perceive you, and you can change how you perceive life.**\n\nAnd just to put a little plug in, I have built a [website](http://www.thehealthygamer.com/) and [Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/HappyJacksChannel) that is dedicated to helping nerdy gamers become fit, active, and confident(because I grew up addicted to UO/EQ/WoW).\n\n* [If you're into the whole facebook thing would love to get more like-minded folks active on the facebook page to share ideas/get new ideas/motivate each other.](https://www.facebook.com/thehealthygamerchannel)\n\nMy passion in life is helping others realize the potential hidden within them. We all have within us the seed of greatness. It is up to you to awaken and nurture that seed until it propels you into the life that you've always known you deserved. Go out there. Take action. Make it happen.\n\nFeel free to ask me questions about training/fitness/nutrition/self development/confidence/women/motivation. I'm going to check this thread pretty regularly for the next week and answer all of them. And again guys, if you put hard work into it you can absolutely achieve anything in life.\n\n**FAQ**\n\n* What exercise regime did I follow? - I followed Madcow 5x5 for most of the period. I now do 5x3x1. I modify both of these by adding in extra sets of hypertrophy specific work at the end of the workout(3-5 sets of an exercise that compliments the major muscle groups worked that day with 10-15 reps). \n\n* What kind of diet do you recommend? - I have tried literally everything. Keto, 40/40/20, carb cycling, high carb, low carb, whole grain, no grain, 2g protein/lb, etc. From all of that I firmly believe that in order to have optimal body composition and optimal health we MUST eliminate or greatly reduce our consumption of processed carbohydrates. I follow a primal/paleo lifestyle now. I eat eggs, nuts, fruits, veggies, meats. I avoid breads, pastas, flours, legumes, dairy(lactose intolerant as an Asian anyways).\n\n* To expand on the diet - I think Keto is very effective for losing fat, but can be hard to follow. What I do now is intermittent fasting and primal eating. This makes it almost effortless to maintain an 8-10% bodyfat and if I ever want to lose fat I simply lower my carb intake for two to three meals in the week.\n\n* [The best book I've ever read on the subject of nutrition that's written in an accessible and easy to read fashion is Mark Sisson's Primal Blueprint](http://www.amazon.com/The-Primal-Blueprint-Reprogram-effortless/dp/0982207786/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1361403480&sr=8-1&keywords=primal+blueprint)\n\n* The best way to gain weight IMO is to increase your sources of healthy fats and eat nutritious carbohydrates. Healthy fats: avocados, coconut oiil, olive oil, almonds, almond butter to name a few. Nutritious carbohydrates: sweet potatoes, fruits, veggies, plantanes, yucca roots.\n\n* What kind of cardio did I do? I did a lot of steady state stuff. BUT today I do mostly high intensity interval cardio and circuit cardio. Examples of interval cardio: sprint for 60 seconds, walk for 90 seconds, repeat 5-6x. Example of cardio circuit: 20 pushups, 25 bodyweight squats, 6 pullups, 25 crunches, back to back with 30s rest before you do it again. Repeat 5-6x. This type of cardio imo is MUCH more efficient and actually better at helping you arrive at your fat loss/muscle building gains than doing steady state cardio(running/elliptical for half an hour or more.) - There is a study that showed participants who did 8 minutes of interval cardio where they exercised for 60s, rested for 30s, burned MORE calories than participants who did steady state cardio(hr of 150) for half an hour.\n\n* How do you incorporate running with weight lifting? - I run two times a week, always after my leg days. My leg days are monday and friday so I will run either tuesday and saturday, or after the leg workout on Monday and Fridays just depending on what I feel like doing. Always give your legs at least 36 hours if not 48 hours of full rest before doing heavy leg days.\n\n* What self-development books do I recommend? - ALL OF THEM. Megaliving and The Monk Who Sold his Ferrari by Robin Sharma are both really good. Tony Robbins has a bunch of good books, I've only read his Unlimited Power books however and it was pretty good. Jack Canfield(the author of all the chicken soup for the soul books) has some very nice books on finding success in life. Of course there's the cornerstone book of Think and Grow Rich which every self-development guru points to, and I have to say I found it to be a fantastic read. Code to Joy is a really interesting look at how early childhood traumas impact our present day emotions and actions.\n\n* I also HIGHLY recommend audio books. To date Earl Nightengale's \"The Strangest Secret\" is still the most motivational thing I've ever heard, here's a link to the full thing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62DqsD2s5V8 Load up your MP3 player with audio books and listen to them EVERYWHERE you go. Between driving, the gym, and random housework where you don't have to really focus the average person can squeeze in 3+ hours of audio books a day. That adds up to a tremendous amount of knowledge gained over a period of years.\n\n* **MEDITATION** Meditation is the ONE practice that lead me to be able to make every other inner change I've ever made. Without meditation I would not be the person I am. The real power in meditation is its ability to: center you, clear your thoughts, and give you that deep **knowing** that everything is okay, that no matter what happens you will be okay, and that life is wonderful. I highly recommend anyone who is interested in improving themselves to pick up the practice of meditating for at least 5 minutes each day. I meditate for 5 minutes in the morning, 20 min in the afternoon, and an additional 10 mins before I go to bed. It is very simple. I just focus on my breathing and bring my attention to the present. That's all you have to do.\n\n* PHEW alright I think that covered most of the questions, if you have more ask away, I'm going to monitor this thread closely for the next week.\n\nEdit: Added a FAQ to OP", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "So I heard /r/Fitness liked Asian Transformations.

If this isn't allowed, mods, feel free to delete. \n\nI had previously shared my weight loss story a few months back but only shared the basics with just face photos. I wanted to share how I lost my weight and became a Crossfit athlete along with full body photos.\n\n**The background story:** Ever since I can recall (probably around the age of 12), I have been overweight/obese. By the age of 19, I was at my heaviest when I hit 285 pounds. I decided I wanted to lose weight and started running with some gym work. I was able to shed about 40 pounds, although my diet was still sloppy. I fluctuated around this weight and around the age of 24, I decided to check out the local Crossfit gym.\n\nWith the support of the local gym, I learned the Paleo lifestyle but for some reason, I wouldn't stick to it. I would eat great 2-3 days a week, workout 1-2 times per week and then go back to my old, unhealthy lifestyle. I would lose a pound or two one week and gain 3-4 the next. It was a large struggle. \n\nI later moved to a different region and joined the local crossfit in this city. I decided I wanted to take the gym a bit more serious and this is where the transformation happened:\n\n**The crossfit/exercise :** What called me to this specific gym was the fact the box owner was in the Regionals that year and the box frequently had top athletes in local competitions. I figured if I could do half of what they do, I should at least look somewhat better than the fat dude I once was.\n\nI began their programming at the age of 27 (about 2.5 years ago). My goal was somehow, someway, to turn back over 15 years of damage the best way I can, and this was exercising every day with a great diet. I started doing their WOD every single day, 5-6 days per week. I would rarely miss more than twice per week. I would scale accordingly and in the beginning, I couldn't finish a single workout in the time provided. The days I wasn't feeling in the mood to crossfit, I would push myself to run at least a 5k. The 5k was difficult to achieve in the earlier days so I would run half a mile, walk half, etc. Now, it's much easier, I could run an entire 5K unbroken, albeit, my times are not excellent, running below 9 minutes is satisfactory for me. \n\n**The Diet:** Modified Paleo. I would try Paleo the best I can but I wouldn't solely stick to it. If it wasn't available or I wasn't in the mood, I would just try to eat as healthy as I possibly could and portion-control took a huge part.\n\n**Current Status:** I've since become a fitness-fan. I don't just love Crossfit, I love fitness. I enjoy running. I now get an exciting feeling when my hands grip a barbell. I enjoy speaking about fitness and love when I hear people share their stories. I enjoy the healthy lifestyle that I always thought I would never be a part of. I used to give myself excuses - from \"My genes aren't made to be fit\" to \"I must have something wrong with me, I just can't lose weight\". \n\nThis past weekend, this former 285lb fat boy competed in his first local competition. I didn't place top 3, I did compete scaled and not RX, I placed decent, I completed every single workout on time and even placed 1st in my division on one of the 7 workouts. I'm not a Games' Athlete but I am proud of how far I've gotten.\n\n**Current Shape:** You will notice on the photos, while I look significantly different from my original self a few years back, I have scars to remind me of my lack of fitness years ago. The stretch marks are there and the excess/loose skin, while not a whole lot, is very visible. At the moment, I don't plan on surgery. This is me, this is what I look like and I don't know what I may consider tomorrow, but at the time being, they're a reminder of the bad choices I've made in years past which I hope to never put myself through again.\n\n**PHOTOS:**\nIt was really hard to find a before pic without a shirt since I was ashamed of how my body looked. Here's a few old shots I was able to find.

Sodium levels in the blood must be carefully maintained.\n\n>If you eat a lot of salt \u2014 sodium chloride \u2014 you will become thirsty and drink water, diluting your blood enough to maintain the proper concentration of sodium. Ultimately you will excrete much of the excess salt and water in urine.\n\n>The theory is intuitive and simple. And it may be completely wrong.\n\n>**New studies of Russian cosmonauts, held in isolation to simulate space travel, show that eating more salt made them less thirsty but somehow hungrier. Subsequent experiments found that mice burned more calories when they got more salt, eating 25 percent more just to maintain their weight.**\n\n[JCI paper one: High salt intake reprioritizes osmolyte and energy metabolism for body fluid conservation](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/88532#SEC3) \n\n> Natriuretic regulation of extracellular fluid volume homeostasis includes suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, pressure natriuresis, and reduced renal nerve activity, actions that concomitantly increase urinary Na+ excretion and lead to increased urine volume. The resulting natriuresis-driven diuretic water loss is assumed to control the extracellular volume. Here, we have demonstrated that urine concentration, and therefore regulation of water conservation, is an important control system for urine formation and extracellular volume homeostasis in mice and humans across various levels of salt intake. We observed that the renal concentration mechanism couples natriuresis with correspondent renal water reabsorption, limits natriuretic osmotic diuresis, and results in concurrent extracellular volume conservation and concentration of salt excreted into urine. This water-conserving mechanism of dietary salt excretion relies on urea transporter\u2013driven urea recycling by the kidneys and on urea production by liver and skeletal muscle. **The energy-intense nature of hepatic and extrahepatic urea osmolyte production for renal water conservation requires reprioritization of energy and substrate metabolism in liver and skeletal muscle, resulting in hepatic ketogenesis and glucocorticoid-driven muscle catabolism, which are prevented by increasing food intake.** This natriuretic-ureotelic, water-conserving principle relies on metabolism-driven extracellular volume control and is regulated by concerted liver, muscle, and renal actions.\n\n[JCI paper 2: Increased salt consumption induces body water conservation and decreases fluid intake](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/88530)\n> A 6-g/d increase in salt intake increased urine osmolyte excretion, but reduced free-water clearance, indicating endogenous free water accrual by urine concentration. The resulting endogenous water surplus reduced fluid intake at the 12-g/d salt intake level. Across all 3 levels of salt intake, half-weekly and weekly rhythmical mineralocorticoid release promoted free water reabsorption via the renal concentration mechanism. Mineralocorticoid-coupled increases in free water reabsorption were counterbalanced by rhythmical glucocorticoid release, with excretion of endogenous osmolyte and water surplus by relative urine dilution. A 6-g/d increase in salt intake decreased the level of rhythmical mineralocorticoid release and elevated rhythmical glucocorticoid release. The projected effect of salt-driven hormone rhythm modulation corresponded well with the measured decrease in water intake and an increase in urine volume with surplus osmolyte excretion.\n\n>Humans regulate osmolyte and water balance by rhythmical mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid release, endogenous accrual of surplus body water, and precise surplus excretion.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "New research suggests high salt intake stimulates appetite, fat and muscle breakdown", "post_ups": 2685, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/6a73yi/new_research_suggests_high_salt_intake_stimulates/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:13.604003", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Tovero", "post_created_utc": 1451531818.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1451580610.0, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "3yv7zj", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 606, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2689, "post_selftext": "A year and a half ago I pulled 315 and posted it here.

I always lose some weight and then would yoyo back up to my starting weight or higher. I could never stick to a diet for more than about a month or so. I was a D1 football player years ago, so i knew how to lift, and how to train.... but i didnt know how to be healthy, and how to manage my nutrition. I had lifted off and on for the last 10 years or so since i quit playing, but i never got serious about being back in the gym. \n\nAs i am writing this, my daughter is 3 years old and i also have a 2 year old son. To go along with my beautiful fiance and my two step sons at 6 and 8. \n\nI was always overweight, but in the last few years it was spiralling out of control. last summer and fall i found myself extremely unhappy with who i was becoming. I would literally bring sweat rags with me anywhere i went so i wouldnt soak through my collar... i was having trouble with simple tasks like tying my shoes, or playing any sort of athletic sport. I also was constantly too tired to play with my kids when i got home from work. I just chalked it up to being tired from a long day, but it was more than that. i have a desk job... i should not be this tired.... I desperately did not want to miss out on my kids childhood because i couldnt take care of myself. And i dont want to die and miss them growing up. And most importantly i dont want my poor lifestyle choices to hold them back.... i want them to be outside playing and having fun, and not stuck inside with tv because i wont go out to watch them.\n\nI started doing research in november to figure out what i was going to do. I wanted to take my time and formulate a plan that i could stick to once and for all. after several weeks of studying and thousands of hours and blogs researched, i decided i wanted to try the keto diet. \n\nI know the keto diet is controversial, but i had done my homework and i knew that the low calorie diets had failed for me in the past. I want to point out that i dont claim keto is the answer for everyone, and i never try to push it on people. I think that when it comes to diet, everyone is different, and its important to find hat works for you individually. Whether its iifym, paleo, vegan, low fat, low calorie, or keto. I think that the key is finding what works for you and having the resolve to stick to it. For me this has been KEto. the diet is basically high fat, moderate protein, and low carb. It isnt atkins.... because its high fat. the idea is that the higher fat consumption will help satiate and keep you from having cravings or binging. There is also alot of studies surrounding the medical benefits of a ketogenic diet. \n\nSo once it was decided what diet i was going to do, all that was left was to start. I decided to start the Monday after Thanksgiving. November 28th, 2016. I gave myself the one last holiday to enjoy and then started. I considered waiting through the holiday season and starting the new year.... but i knew there would always be a reason to wait and something coming up... so i just started. I have always been competitive, and knew i would need results to stay motivated... and i would need aggressive goals to keep working towards. \n\nSo i set a 3 month weight loss goal of 100 pounds lost... and a 6 month goal of 150 pounds lost. my 6 month date happens to fall on memorial day. On February 28th... my 3 month mark, i was down exactly 100 pounds. I hit the goal dead on. I was motivated to keep working.\n\nMy training:\nat first i really only walked. i did long dedicated walks, but i also just walked whenever i could... whether it be taking smaller loads to the trash or smaller handful of groceries.... anything to get a few hundred more steps in. after a couple of weeks i started going to the gym.... boy was i out of shape. Most days i was lucky to last 30 minutes.... \n\nAs the weight came off, my endurance began to grow... before i knew it i was starting C25K (around the 2 month mark)... and i was lifting for longer and longer in the gym. I had settled on a 4 day gym split doing a push/pull routine. I did light legs on my pull days to not wear my legs out so i could continue doing cardio in the evenings. \n\nAt the 3 months mark i decided to up my protein and start getting more serious in the gym. I decided to switch my routine and i started with a modified Wendler 5/3/1 program. Basically i was just doing a couple accessory lifts every day in addition to the base program. I have now been doing this program for two months. \n\nAs far as health goes... my life has changed dramatically... I was on 2 different blood pressure meds... cholesterol meds... and was pre diabetic. \n\nI am now off all of my meds and completely normal A1C. \n\nThe Numbers:\n131 pounds lost (at 5 months mark)\n12 belt notches lost\n5x t-shirt down to 2x\n\nas far as lifts i wont post starting because most of the \"gains\" were noobie gains from getting back in the gym finally.\nbench: 325\nsquat: 435\ndeadlift: 485\n\nthese lifts continue to increase dramatically week to week. I expect i am nowhere near my potential yet. \n\nCalories consumed:\ndecember: 1915 cal/day\njanuary: 1528 cal/day ... 44 workouts\nfebruary: 1687 cal/day ... 36 workouts\nmarch: 1732 cal/day ... 32 workouts\napril: 2083 cal/day ... 31 workouts\n\nHere is a recent side by side photo from me in the gym this morning vs me in the summer: http://imgur.com/cg8egWS\n\nhere is an album of other progress pictures from throughout the journey: http://imgur.com/a/IXRO3\n\nIm not posting this to try to convert people to Keto... and i know alot people have strong feelings one way or the other about it. I do think it could help some people who struggle with traditional diets. But i am not trying to be pushy. I more so just want to share and let you all know what has worked for me and to say thanks for all the inspiration i have gotten. I decided at the 100 pound mark to begin chronicling my weightloss journey for anyone who was interested and i really just want to share my experiences. I dont claim to be an expert or anything... just a guy who was changed his life in a short amount of time and am available for anyone who has questions about how.\n\nthank you,\n\n\nEDIT: i'm 6'5\" .... the pics were from 5 months before i started so i gained a little more weight... there is more pics and shirtless pics (beware!) from right before i started on my instagram. \n\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "5 months on keto and in gym: 430 to 299lbs!", "post_ups": 2674, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/68vj4c/5_months_on_keto_and_in_gym_430_to_299lbs/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:13.604003", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "inkshot", "post_created_utc": 1535295053.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1535306353.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "9ag2bc", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 244, "post_num_crossposts": 2, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2664, "post_selftext": "After 2 years of lifting I pulled a [3x bodyweight deadlift]( https://streamable.com/tfois) of 540lbs (245kg) at 178lbs(80kg) and would like to share what I\u2019ve learned to help you improve your deadlift.\n\n**1.Tweak Your Technique**\n====================\n\nThe absolute easiest way to deadlift more is to make the movement less difficult. Putting yourself at a mechanical advantage is simply easier than getting stronger. If you can leverage your body weight to start the lift, you reduce the amount of weight you need to force up. It\u2019s free real estate baby. \n\n_Conventional tutorial by Cailer Woolam_: https://youtu.be/L5paDnk51sQ\n\n_Sumo tutorial by Bryce Krawczyk_: https://youtu.be/LGIS9vs65Sk\n\n\n**2.Strengthen your back**\n====================\n\nWrapping a thread in duct tape helps more than wrapping rope. It\u2019s easier to improve weak links then to further strengthen your strong points. Most people don\u2019t train their back enough, in my opinion it is the biggest factor in getting a big deadlift. Never seen a great deadlifter without a jacked back. [Oleksandr Kutcher\u2019s Back]( http://www.t-nation.com/img/photos/06-174-training/image005.jpg), [Cailer Woolam\u2019s Back]( https://i.redditmedia.com/dRGvQuKG9ZYI_7Im5GW6rKXdDCboPxwQVfUUzNshdWk.jpg?w=320&s=2b47d246fa577b55523679c19023dc2f) , [Bob People\u2019s Back]( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_U__RVEGy-Vg/S8mws7yM2jI/AAAAAAAABpA/NYXda6QCpB4/s400/rigerts+back.jpg)  The three lifts that have helped the most are:\n\n* _Weighted pullups_ (high volume)\n* _Heavy rows_ (low volume)\n* _Heavy barbell shrugs_ (low volume)\n\n3.Learn to love front squats\n====================\nSumo pullers are going to find the biggest carryover from standard front squats due both movements being quad dominant, but both kinds of pullers have a lot to gain from the following two variations. \n\n_Pin front squats_ will blow up your explosive strength. Lower the safety bars and put the barbell at the level it would be at the bottom of a front squat, get under the bar and relax. You\u2019re trying to avoid using the stretch reflex so you'll want to relax your body before you really begin the lift. When I perform these I do them for heavy singles, with generous rest between sets.\n\n_Beltless paused front squats_ **Full Disclosure**: these are ridiculously difficult. Load up 70-80% and pause at the bottom of the squat for 20seconds. These train your trunk not to bow under load and reinforce proper ab engagement.\n\n4.Get properly warmed up\n====================\n\nEach person needs to warm up in a way specific to them. If your hips are naturally externally rotated, then a pigeon pose isn\u2019t really helpful in getting your body ready for something it\u2019s not used to. Identify which movements are difficult for you individually and work on them during warm ups.\n\n5.Avoid using straps\n====================\n\n_\u201cYou grab the bar and smile because you just know you\u2019re gonna get it\u201d_ -Ed Coan. Being able to hold the weight adds a lot of confidence to the pull and assures you aren\u2019t leaving pounds on the table if you decide to compete outside of strongman. Avoiding straps doesn\u2019t mean not using them! Your hands are bound to get tore up at some point, you\u2019ll have high volume sets, and you\u2019ll have cruddy bars that slip. There is nothing wrong with using straps, but avoiding their use is very beneficial.\n\n6.Experiment with programming\n====================\n\nMuch like everything else, effective programming is going to vary person to person. I found that reducing my deadlifting from 2x weekly to 1x actually produced better results. For the majority of people I advocate for submaximal training and with bias recommend you try it out as well. \n\n_Here is a video by powerlifter Brendan Tietz on submaximal programming_: https://youtu.be/pz8aOIcj_v0\n\n\nAnother important factor of programming is the time between cycles, the deload. As the weights get heavier your body will accumulate fatigue faster, providing it time to reset will allow you to lift with a higher intensity over time. \n\n_Here is a video by strongman Brian Alsruhe on deloading_: https://youtu.be/wzwP-e0C6Cs\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nImplementing any of these tips should help you improve your deadlift, I hope everyone gets some use out of them!\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "6 Ways To Improve Your Deadlift", "post_ups": 2664, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9ag2bc/6_ways_to_improve_your_deadlift/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:13.604003", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "linjan111", "post_created_utc": 1477570923.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "59nnv3", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 302, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2660, "post_selftext": "I'm currently doing the PPL from the wiki, and on push day there are 6 sets of lat raises which are superset with 3 sets of triceps pushdowns and 3 sets of overhead triceps extensions. \n\nI don't really get the exercise.

A few years ago, I did, but didn\u2019t know how to go about learning one. A lot of muscle-up tutorial videos I saw in the past missed out on important key tips that helped me personally. I have been asked how I got mine to be clean many times, and today I share an in-depth 5-minute tutorial with you to hopefully help you towards achieving one.\n\n#**Video Link**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKdGQXyGgZU\n\nThe **two biggest tips** I would recommend when you obtain the strength to do a muscle up are the following:\n\n**1**) Utilizing a thumbless grip to make it easier to pull yourself over the bar\n\n**2**) Pulling yourself slightly away from the bar and creating separation once you develop sufficient strength to do explosive pull-ups.\n\nThis video is focused around the **principle of specificity** (what I did to accomplish a muscle-up), which is just a concept that you what you do in the gym should be related to your goals. \n\nThe movements I focused on most were similar to the muscle up itself\u2013 lat pulldowns \u2192 pull-ups \u2192 weighted pull-ups. In my opinion, the biggest key to getting a clean muscle up is by getting strong on your pull-ups and doing them with explosiveness and proper form. Sticking within the 1 \u2013 5 rep range and focusing on explosion and strength development can be very beneficial. \n\nIt is also very important to focus on retracting the scapula and creating a stable shoulder when doing pulling movements to prevent shoulder injury. This focus on scapular retraction will also help you increase your back strength and allow for quicker progression to the muscle-up.\n\nOnce you master the pull-up and can easily explode to get your chest around bar level, utilizing a band can really assist you in grooving the muscle up movement. If you don\u2019t have a band, you can also jump into the movement with a lower bar or practice negatives/eccentric muscle ups. Again, specificity is key and while there are many other great back exercises, focusing on the listed movements will be most helpful in achieving your muscle-up goals. \n\n##Feel free to share this video with friends/anyone you think it may help who is interested in this movement. I truly hope it helps you! I have some questions for you guys as well to start a discussion. If the interest is there, I\u2019ll be happy to answer questions through this post (they don't have to be muscle-up related).\n\n\n1) Have you ever tried doing a muscle up?\n\n2) How many pull-ups did you do before getting to a muscle up (if you have done one?)\n\n3) How many pull-ups can you currently do?\n\n4) What do you enjoy more? Calisthenics, physique/bodybuilding or powerlifting?\n\n5) Why do you want to learn a muscle up?

Every thing in the video and post is 100% true and factual, I may have done stuff \"normal\" people my size haven't, but not everyone has my determination and motivation. It hurt, my legs were sore, my feet were throbbing, my heart racing, but I focus 24/7 and when i feel like slowing down, I feel my fathers hand push my back and say, \"you got this, keep going\", So PLEASE quit with the hate, if you don't believe me fine, but my ENTIRE city has seen me do this in 6 months and I have their support, I just thought I would share to offer support to those looking for it. Thank you. -Jonathon\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOk. So, To start, I was 477 pounds and completely miserable. I was in a size 60\" waist pants and a 6XL shirt. I was depressed, tired, and almost immobile. I had a history of giving up on myself, but not this time. I made a video to give my full history and story..http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTk_ge1KIPU\n\nHow did I do it?\nFirst off, I was monitored by a doctor, nutritionist, and the power of the internet to learn exercises. I had blood tests drawn every two weeks to make sure I didn't damage anything by losing weight so quickly. I did not. \n\nI maintained a diet high in protein, low in carbs, and full of veggies and light on fruits. Absolutely no sweets in food form or drinks. I drank water only. I stayed on a 1500-2000 calorie diet. \n\nI started out walking and progressed to jogging, then running, the running and lifting. As of today, I run/jog 65-70 miles a week. I weight lift 2 hours a day, 6 days a week. \n\nI have not nor will I ever take any type of pill, drink, supplement, and I did not have a surgery. Everything I have done has been 100% natural. \n\nLoose Skin? \nNot too much really, I lift weights enough that it is filled in with muscle pretty good, where it is loose, is much better than full of fat in my opinion. \n\nToo Fast?\nNo, monitored by doctors made sure I lost quick but not too quick. \n\nBefore and after pics...\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9RG4Bsk.jpg - \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8GSwykW.jpg - Holding old 60\" pants\n\n\nBefore and after info\n\n60\" waist to a 42\" waist\n6XL shirt to a XL Shirt\n15 Shoes to a 12 Shoes\n15 ring to a 12 Ring\n23\" neck to a 17\" neck\n22 minute mile to a 8-8.5 minute mile (single mile)\ncould not do 5K to a 35 minute 5k\nI have walk/jogged/ran 1500 miles since July\n\n\nI plan to lose about 60 more, to get to 250, then maintain by doing every other day workouts. \n\n\nI am sure I am forgetting something, all questions welcome and if you like my video please share and subscribe, thanks. \n\n\nEDIT* For the frequently asked questions on the comments\n\n1.) Yes I walk/jog/run a total of 8-12 miles a day, if that sounds like a lot it is because it is. I wanted to do a marathon on my 1 year anniversary of starting my lifestyle, so that is where I train the hardest. \n\n2.) Yes, I really am (in the picture) 317 pounds. I am 6'3\"-6'4\" tall (When doctor originally measured I was slightly slouched because of my gut, and I was 6'3\" then.\n\n3.) My diet is listed, it isn't much more than eating plenty of meats, 25-30G of low glycemic carbs, and the proper fats found in lean animal meats, nut and stuff like that. (need info on carbs? -http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU1BwjtnTO8)\n\n4.) My bench did not \"Go Up\" from 165 to 335. I left high school benching 225-250, I played football, my position? Bench. lol. But i still got to lift weights. So in reality, I just had to retrain the muscles and get form back that was already there. I did not and do not have spaghetti arms, I did have a shoulder injury in high school and lifting on a bar irritates it, so I do not do it that often, I prefer working with individual plates so I can adjust weight accordingly, for those calling Bullshit on lifting 300 anything with arms, here is a video of a 360 Pound incline press on individual converging plates machine, ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEWy40Hmzsw) I know I know, its not the same, but I can move that kind of weight, I could only load to 360 pounds because the bar was full on both sides. \n\n5.) My day is 100% focused to fitness. I told myself when i started, i will train as much as it takes, even it that means a temporary sacrifice of time with family and friends to get healthy. SO yes, 430 Im up and start running, run for 1.5-2 hours, come home, get kids to school, work out from 12-1 on lunch, get home go to gym or run from as early as 7pm-9pm, Then bed by 930 10. I do this at least 5 days a week, on weekends, my kids join me and we all go hiking, or walking or who knows what. \n\n6.) I DO NOT TAKE supplements, that doesn't mean I am against them, it just means, I DO NOT take them. That is it, I prefer getting nutrition through food,  because I like to eat. lol\n\n7.) I am not selling anything. I am trying to inspire people because I know what it feels like to be in the 400+ club and not see a lot of before and in progress pics. BEfore and After are cool, BUT they do not always show how hard the journey is physically and mentally. I share my journey to inspire anyone looking to lose weight.

[Here's the transformation for those who don't like to read all about it](http://imgur.com/SRLiqaI)\n\n**Where everything started**\n\nI was always the scrawny kid. I played soccer since I was 6 years old and was pretty athletic - but that was it. I was about 130 lbs (59 kg) at 5'7'' (170 cm) when I turned 18.\nAfter finishing high school in Germany, I was given the opportunity to go to the US for a year and work as an intern. During that time I started something called Freeletics, a german bodyweight / cardio program, which promised great muscular results after 12 weeks. I completely neglected my diet and even lost weight during that time. I quit about half way through and decided I had to gain weight no matter what it takes.\n\n**Going to the gym in the states**\n\nI started going to the high school gym (the high school my guest families kids went to) about two or three times a week, where we followed a training regime given to us by the gym coach. He actually thought I was an exchange student for about half a year, haha. It was pretty much a full body powerlifting workout. We deadlifted, squatted and benched, doing a few acessories here and there. I was really lucky to have proper guidance from the start, so I didn't waste a lot of time doing uneffective workouts. He also drilled us to eat a lot. I pretty much used myfitnesspal from the get go (shooting for 3500 kcal in my first year) and bulked to about 148 lbs (67 kg). I think I benched 185 lbs (84 kg), squatted 250 lbs (113 kg) and deadlifted 275 lbs (125 kg) when I left the states.\n\n**Back home**\n\nBack in Germany I moved out to study in a bigger city about 4 hours away from home. Now I could cook for myself and go the gym without relying on someone to drive me! I was psyched. I started a PPL routine, but soon switched to a classic upper lower split, due to schedule issues. I just couldn't make it to the gym 6 times a week. I continue to follow this routine until today. Bench is 250 lbs (113 kg). I haven't actually squatted or deadlifted in a long time. The last time I deadlifted, my 1 rep max was 350 lbs (160 kg).\n\nUpper:\n\nBench Press 3x6-8\nIncline DB Press 3x6-8\nT-bar Rows 3x6-8\nClose grip lat pulldowns 3x6-8\nOverhead Press 2x6-8\nLater DB Raises 2x6-10\nIncline seated DB curles 3x6-10\nOverhead DB Tricep Press 3x6-10\n\nLower:\n\nHacksquats 3x6-8\nLeg Press 3x6-8\nSLDL 3x6-8\nLying leg curls 3x6-10\nMachine calf raises 3x8-12\nCables Crunches 3x8-12\n\n**What my diet looks like right now**\n\nHonestly, I have never cut in my life, so I only know how to ride the bulk train. My heaviest was around 170 lbs (77 kg), but after a few months of not being able to lift I am back at around 160 lbs (73 kg) at the moment. I shoot for 3200 kcal (at least 130 g protein). A nice clean, slow bulk. Due to dairy and nut intolerances that I just discovered I have had to change quite a bit in my diet.\n\nBreakfast (800 kcal):\n\n2 rolls with chocolate spread\nGlas of juice and cup of coffee\n\nLunch (500 kcal):\n\nToast with margerine and sliced chicken breast\nRoasted Sunflower seeds as a side, just to snack on\n\nShake (900 kcal):\n\nOats, Soymilk, frozen berries, a banana, linseeds and olive oil\n\nDinner (1000 kcal):\n\nThis varies a lot. I try to get a good amount of protein at dinner. I like stir-frying and steak with sweet potatoes and veggies, and so on - anything's allowed as along as I hit my 1000 kcal.\n\nOf course I try to sleep as much as possible. I get in about 8 hours every night, weekends vary. I am sure I could have had even better progress cutting out alcohol completely, but I can honestly say that a few beers on the weekend really didn't kill my gains.\n\n**Supplements**\n\n5 g creatine\nFish oil\nWhey protein (I stopped putting it in my shake when I discovered my dairy intolerance)\n\n**Final words**\n\nCan't describe how lifting benefited my life. It taught me discipline and made me much more confident. The first few months in 2016 were hard for me, I wasn't able to workout consistently due to work related stuff and lost quite a bit of the muscle. I was devasted how weak I was when I got back in the gym, but I pushed myself and started building the habit again. For me it is all about building habits. After 3 years one would think it is a no brainer to get off the couch and go the work out, but for me it is a continious struggle to stay motiviated. Eating enough is super hard for meas well and I have to remind myself everday to hit my goal, but when you're persistant and trust the process without looking to far into the future and being overwhelmed by the path in front of you, everything is possible. \n\nEdit: Thank you all for your kind words!

Here's the video below (I do a 700 pound block pull first, then 700 off the floor second, so please watch both):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnLmFGUxQ9s\n\nI figured i'd post a bit about my training and diet here as well.\n\n**Diet**\n\nI overshot my intended goal weight of 231 pounds a couple months ago and am currently several pounds over. While before I was eating pretty much everything, I've started watching the amount of fat and carbs I've been eating much more closely. I've cut out most unhealthy foods like shakes and donuts whereas before I would freely eat these foods to garner energy for lifting and to put on size. \n\nWhile I'm moderately attentive to my carb and fat intake, I am extremely concerned with eating enough protein. I try to average about 1g of protein intake daily per pound of bodyweight (therefore aiming to consume 234g protein daily). \n\n**Training**\n\nI recently changed my training from 3-4 days a week to 4-5 days a week to accommodate an additional bench day since the lift seemed to be lagging behind. This has been a lot more taxing that I thought, but I figure it's worth the effort if I want to do well at the Arnold. After all, the Arnold will be my last powerlifting competition as junior (ages 20-23) and I'd like to maximize my strength.\n\nI set my training up so that several months out from the meet I was doing hypertrophy work (work to build muscle which will later be conditioned). I gradually tapered towards lower reps and sets to condition my muscles. Currently, at one month out, I am doing 2x2s and 3x3s. \n\nI bench twice a week now; one day is a heavy day where i'll do 2x2 or 3x3 and the other day is typically lighter and a bench accessory like close-grip or using boards.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding powerlifting or any critiques, please post here and I'd be glad to comment!\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "700 Pound Deadlift PR!

I have not been on the /r/fitness subreddit for very long but frequented /r/ketogains for a long time during the initial cut. Thank you all for your advice.\n\nTL;DR: Ate at a deficit while cutting carbs, kept up my protein intake while lifting. Reached goal weight and slowly increased calories to maintenance and a bit above to gain muscle. PICTURES: sorry deleted pics\n\n\n**A little background**: I was a cross country/track running in highschool but let myself go in the following 4.5 years of college. I occasionally went to the gym, but with no real goal in mind. I never really saw myself as too big, but definitely not in shape. Out of college, I got my first big job, and didnt want to cook so I usually ate out everyday for lunch. I was going to the gym, but again, no real goal in mind. I purchased a scale and that was what really did it for me. If I ever hit 200 I knew something needed to change. \n\n**The Start:** So I hopped back on the low carb /r/keto train hard. I am a creature of habit, so cold turkey is what I do well with.  No cheat meals. I set my deficit pretty aggressive and started losing weight. At the same time, I made my gym attendance much more regular. 3 times a week for about 9 months.\n\nWorkout as follows: (3sets x 8reps ftw, superset the two exercises)\n\n> Bench Press + Calf Raise\n> \n> Wide grip pullups + Abs\n> \n> Squat/Leg Press + Dips\n> \n> Bicep Curls + Moar Abs\n>\n> Seated Row + Something else I wanted to workout\n>\n> I may be missing somethings, but that was the routine for the most part.\n\nMacros/Main Meals:\n\n> As per /r/ketogains subreddit, I tried to keep protein around 1g/lb of lean body mass. Kept carbs as low as possible and filled the rest with fat. And I also tried my hand at intermittent fasting to try and speed things up.\n>\n> Lunch (@work): ~0.8lb grilled chicken breast, 3x Cheese Stick, Ranch/Sriracha for dipping\n>\n> Dinner: 5x Eggs scrambled with cheese and Sriracha\n>\n> I filled in other macros with almonds, pork rinds, peanut butter, celery, other veggies\n\nI hit my first goal of 165, and reevaluated. I was surprised to learn how small of a frame I had so I kept cutting. 155 went by and I was fairly content, but reeeeeallly wanted abs. They were coming in slowly, but it meant I had even more fat to lose. So I tried to push it a bit more. I ended my cut a tad over 145.\n\n**After ~9 Months:**\nI ate at maintenance for a bit, still pretty low carb just because of habit. I have since started eating slightly above maintenance to try and slowly put on some more muscle. I am still pretty scared of putting fat back on, so this slow bulk seems to be working for me. My current workout has changed since I want to go to the gym more often and work muscle groups twice a week. Its 'Shortcut to Shred' but modified a bit. It ended up looking a bit like PHAT. I am currently working on adding carbs back into my diet. Going to try to keep sugar out however, I tended to binge sugary candies before.\n\n> Monday - Wednesday (6-8 reps) , Thursday - Saturday (9-11 reps)\n>\n> Chest/Tri, Shoulders/Legs, Back/Bi\n\n*Note: I am sorry I don't have starting lift numbers or any 1 rep maxes currently*\n\nSupplements:\n\n> ON Protein, multivitamin, potassium , calcium, creatine\n>\n> Preworkout after work, before gym (coffee doesnt do it for me anymore)\n\n**Progress Pictures**\n\nsorry deleted pics\n\n\n**Current Goal:** \nMy current goal is to keep slowing putting muscle on. The first goal would be 165lbs and look fantastic in a new suit. I have two weddings coming up I have to be in.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI may not be as lean or as big as I want, but I am happy with my progress so far. I am in love with the gym now and dont see myself slowing down for a while. Its like a real life RPG! +4 strength, +5 size, +1 self-loathing!\n\nThe best thing I have gained from this experience IMO is discipline.\n\nI am probably leaving something out, or I may have formatted it terribly, so feel free to ask questions. Thanks for reading, just wanted to share.\n\nEdit 3: There may have been some confusion about my goal.\n\n> I may not be as lean or as big as I want, but I am happy with my progress so far.\n\nI am not looking to bodybuild, I am not looking to powerlift, I am trying to look good in my own eyes. Which in this case is a bit bigger and a bit leaner. That goal may always be on the next hill over, but I'm going to enjoy the journey.\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "1 year progress of diet and lifting: 24 Male 200lb > 145lb > 155lb (pics)", "post_ups": 2616, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4j0rfn/1_year_progress_of_diet_and_lifting_24_male_200lb/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:13.604003", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "loulan", "post_created_utc": 1439398842.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "3gqqwf", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 1063, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2620, "post_selftext": "[Photos of said things.](http://i.imgur.com/aOGTkfk.jpg)\n\nI'm always afraid of bench pressing usually, which prevents me from reaching my maximum (I honestly don't feel like bothering random people at my gym every time I go to get a spotter).

In late November of 2012, I injured myself and had to use crutches for about a month. I wasn't able to jog for 6 months and I began letting myself go when it came to proper dieting. I would eat fast food and drink beer regularly which ultimately led to me getting to my heaviest weight of about 210 lbs. Around mid-December of 2014 I decided it was time to take control and finally begin losing all of my excess fat. I started at around 203 lbs with 33% bodyfat. Since I had lifted weights for years, I had a decent amount of muscle and strength so I tried to be very careful to not lose any of it. I lifted weights about 5 times a week, sometimes 6. I also incorporated cardio and HIIT once or twice a week. What really helped me lose fat was portion control; I began eating only until I was satisfied, which was very difficult. My goal is to reach 10% bodyfat and then begin bulking back to about 180 lbs, but lean of course. \n\nDuring my 50+ lbs of cutting, I've been able to maintain close to 100% of my strength as well as running a 6 minute mile. I always heavily preferred weightlifting over running/cardio, but I knew that doing both together would be really effective in terms of fat loss. At first, I would add HIIT with the stationary bike, which I did for about a month. Then I did suicides after my workout twice a week, plus a 3 mile run once a week for about 2 months total. Eventually, I got rid of the suicides and 3 mile run and began trying to run a mile on the treadmill as fast as possible, which I would do after weightlifting. I started off around 8+ minutes and was able to run a 6 minute mile after about 2 months. During this 6th and most recent month, I have begun trying to run a mile as fast as I can first thing in the morning. I think changing my routine was an important factor in my fat loss, and I recommend it to anyone out there.\n\nThis journey has really changed my outlook on fitness and health and because of that I am pursuing my personal trainer certification. Engineering is my primary profession but motivating and helping others achieve their fitness goals has become a new passion for me. Several of my friends and family have been inspired by my results and have sought out my advice, and I hope this post inspires even more people. I have a fitness blog that I frequently update with workouts, meals, and nutrition advice so that people who are busy can find ways to incorporate fitness and proper dieting into their life. If anyone is interested in viewing it, please message me. I would also love to answer any questions regarding my transformation and regarding fitness, nutrition, and weightlifting in general.\n\nHere are two of my sample meal plans:\n\n**Sample Meal Plan for Full Workout Day**\n\nNote: I keep the sugars separate from the complex carbs.

The body then starts using fat and ketones as primary energy sources. A high protein diet (i.e. 2.2 g/kg) does not seem to prevent ketosis. Some claim that keto is the best diet for improving body composition, endurance, and strength. \n\nWe have reviewed the ketogenic literature and come to the following conclusions:\n\n##Fat loss \n\nKeto does not seem to offer a distinct advantage for fat loss when both groups in a study eat the same amount of calories. People on the ketogenic diet typically lose body weight quicker, but this is most likely due to glycogen depletion and water loss.\n\nThe most commonly measured ketone body, Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB), does not seem to correlate with fat loss. However, this depends on which studies we include and exclude from our analysis. Go to ketone levels and fat loss for graphs, details, and discussion.\n\n##Muscle mass \n\nWe generally see greater lean body mass (LBM) loss in ketogenic diet groups. Note that lean body mass contains water, glycogen, and muscle protein, by definition. It is hard to say with certainty that LBM loss implies greater \u201cdry\u201d muscle protein loss. \u201cWet\u201d LBM can come and go quickly because it consists of water and glycogen.\n\n##Endurance performance \n\nMost studies suggest that aerobic and anaerobic performance is either impaired or maintained on a ketogenic diet. However, many of the studies have small sample sizes, no control group, or are quite short (2-6 weeks). These limitations, and many others, reduce our ability to draw strong conclusions.\n\n##Strength performance \n\nControl groups tend to gain more strength than keto, yet most studies find no statistically significant differences between groups. In most studies, the keto group ate more protein than control. We can\u2019t rightfully compare them without matching protein and total energy. Several of the studies do not measure ketosis.\n\n##Individual diet responses \n\nThe data we have discussed in this article deals with how people respond on average. However, individuals can respond very differently to the same diet. Some have a lot of success on keto, and some do not. Hence, one diet might not work for you, but perhaps another will.\n\nThe graph below shows what happens before and after 5 people were put on a ketogenic diet. Their endurance, as measured by time to exhaustion, varied from person to person (Phinney et al., 1983).\n\n(Graph in article)\n\n##Issues in keto research\n\nThe keto literature has many issues, conflicts of interest, and limitations.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n- Many studies do not measure blood ketone levels, meaning we do not know if the participants were in a ketogenic state or not.\n\n- Many studies do not directly track how much the study participants ate. We are then \u201cforced\u201d to trust that the participants ate the amount of carbs they were assigned.\n\n- Keto groups tend to eat more protein and less calories than control groups.\n\n- Many studies have poor methodology or experimental design.\n\n- (lack of) carbohydrates affect body composition estimations.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "The Ketogenic Diet\u2019s Impact on Body Fat, Muscle Mass, Strength, and Endurance (2017, research review)", "post_ups": 2601, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/78pnc5/the_ketogenic_diets_impact_on_body_fat_muscle/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:13.604003", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "DizzleStu", "post_created_utc": 1462881228.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "4iou1d", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 588, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2595, "post_selftext": "Two years ago I separated from the military and, as you would expect, gained a bunch of weight.

My diet was absolute trash and I had several alcoholic beverages a night. I had to buy bigger pants and most of my t-shirts were starting to get a little too snug.  I don\u2019t feel my attitude changed that much, but I knew that I was letting myself fall into a hole that was going to be hard to get out of.\n\nI work as a contractor at the same base I was stationed at, and late last year I got the \u2018opportunity\u2019 to deploy for four months.  120 days straight of turning wrenches overseas didn\u2019t sound fun at all (and it hasn\u2019t been), but it gave me all the tools to try and get back in shape: an unchanging schedule, easy diet regulation (chow hall food), and a 24HR fitness center. \n\n\nI\u2019m 27 years old, 5\u20198\u201d tall, and when I got here in January the scale read 233 lbs. [Scale](http://i.imgur.com/9fLgYuU.jpg)\n\nStart [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/qLJTknF.jpg)\n\n30 Days [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/6azwMly.jpg)\n\n60 Days [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/zXtOaiO.jpg)\n\n90 Days [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/QqRX7pJ.jpg)\n\n120 days [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/kBodTpH.jpg)\n\n**The Workout**\n\nMy routine changed as time went on and I was able to demand more from my body, but this is what I settled into.  The fitness center is about 1.5 miles from where I\u2019m  housed, so I started walking to and from the gym every day.  Eventually I was able to start jogging back instead of walking, and soon started altering my route to cover more distance.  Now I\u2019m jogging two miles to the gym, lifting, then jogging a three mile route back.  Towards the end I was doing this 6 days a week.\nMy whole goal was to cut fat, so most of my lifts are of the light-weight, high-rep variety.  I would usually do my sets as quickly as possible, interval style, getting in about 6-8 different lifts (3-4 sets each, of 15-20 reps) in about 30 min.  I tried to never do the same lifts for a muscle group two times in a row, and always finished each workout with three sets of something for abs. \nI was going to type out a list of the workouts I did for each muscle group, but you can look up lists and find things that work best for you.  \n\nHere is the planner I made to keep track of my workouts, weight loss, how much I was running every day, and the days left till I get to come home.\n\n**The Diet**\n\nLike I mentioned before, my diet was pretty bad before I got here.  Way too much fast food and bourbon.  For the first couple months I kept myself to about 1000-1200 calories a day, and increased it slightly as my workouts intensified.  As far as what foods I eat, its the same old shit you hear.  High protein, low carb.  While working my 12hr shift we got two meal breaks and always ate at the chow hall on base so it was pretty easy to eat healthy.  Right after my workout I would eat the same breakfast every day, which was two eggs with some veggies, oatmeal with some raisins or bananas, grits, a piece of wheat toast or half of a bagel, and some milk.\n\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/S76HtNB.jpg)\n\nFor lunch is was a little harder because the chow hall wouldn\u2019t always have healthy options, but I would usually have one piece of meat (usually chicken breast, grilled pork chop, or baked turkey), steamed rice, and some vegetables\n\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Mbn1cHg.jpg)\n\nBetween meals I tried to always have a little something in my stomach to keep my metabolism burning.  Whenever I felt a hunger pang I would eat half of a protein or fiber bar.  It is also important to remember that your metabolism slows down considerably when you sleep, so to maximize my fat loss I would avoid eating anything within four hours of bedtime.  A lot of times this means going to bed hungry, which sucks, but when it was bad enough to keep me awake I would have half a scoop of protein in some water and that usually helped.\n\nCheat food:  I hear a lot of people talk about cheat days.  They don\u2019t exist. Not really anyway.  I gave myself one cheat MEAL a week, and made sure I had it as early in the day as possible.  I could eat pizza or a burger and fries for one meal a week and still maintain my weight loss.  Turn that one meal into a whole day of bad food though and you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure.\n\n**Supplementation**\n\nFor the first two months I used a pre-workout supplement (Pump HD by bpi has always been my favorite), Lipo-6 Black fat burner, and a typical Whey protein.\nFor the last two months I did the same but switched out the Lipo for the Animal Cuts stack.\nDon\u2019t put too much stock in fat burners and cutting pills,  they only help if you are already working really hard, and even then only a little.  I did find that they helped with my energy in the gym though.  Very noticeably.  Especially the Animal Stack.  I would have to be careful with my pre-supplement though.  The Lipo and the Animal Stack already had their own stimulants so I would only use about 1/3 of a scoop, sipping it as I walked or jogged to the gym.\n\n\n**Tips and Tricks**\n\nA couple small things can make a big difference when it comes to getting back in shape.  One of the things that helped me the most was writing everything down.  Being able to look back and see everything I had done (or didn\u2019t do) was motivating.  \nAnother big helper was timing.  I suggest going to the gym or exercising right after you wake up.  Your body uses its stored energy to fuel your workout, rather than the food you\u2019ve been eating throughout the day, and your metabolism will be working harder all day to help your body recover. Plus a good workout will make you feel better and happier all day.  It also helps you control your diet.  Instead of, \u201cHey I can eat this cause I\u2019ll just work it off at the gym later,\u201d its, \u201cI\u2019ve already worked out and am doing good today, I\u2019m not going to ruin it by eating something unhealthy.\u201d\nMake going to the gym a necessity, as much as eating and sleeping.  Its easy to go to the gym every day if you don\u2019t give yourself a choice.  Just make it a concrete part of your day to go to the gym, and after a couple weeks you won\u2019t have to make yourself go because you\u2019ll feel great and you\u2019ll WANT to.\nCompete with yourself. Since you\u2019re writing everything down, keep track of your weekly milestones, and try to break them.  Not just how much you can bench or curl, but how many miles you walk or run, how many days in a row (excluding your cheat meal) you stick to your healthy diet.\nYou don\u2019t have to do this permanently.  Yes its good to maintain a regular exercise routine, but you don\u2019t have to go at full speed all the time.  I\u2019m doing this now, but I certainly don\u2019t plan on losing any more weight once I get home.  I will dial it back considerably and work on maintaining.

Read the article):\n\n1) When you test your strength and do 1 rep maxes, you are almost purely using your anaerobic system. But your aerobic system influences how hard you can train which is how you build that max strength. \n\n2) \"For relatively short efforts (like a heavy set of 5) the aerobic system is producing almost a third of the energy needed, and for higher rep sets, it\u2019s producing more than half the energy.\"\n\n\"The implication: **The more powerful your aerobic energy system, the more reps you\u2019ll be able to do with a given weight or percentage of your max, because every bit of energy you can produce aerobically is that much less that you have to produce anaerobically, which pushes off those factors that cause acute muscular fatigue.** Also, if you do the same number of reps with a given amount of weight, less of the energetic contribution will come from your anaerobic energy systems, so the set will be less fatiguing. So **you\u2019re either looking at more work and the same fatigue, or the same amount of work with less fatigue; either way, you win.**\"\n\n3) \"Better aerobic conditioning means you\u2019ll recover faster between sets (and since you\u2019ll be somewhat less reliant on your anaerobic system for each set, they\u2019ll be less fatiguing in the first place) so you can handle higher total training volume.\"\n\n4) Aerobic exercise encourages your body to be in a stronger state of recovery between exercise sessions. \n\n5) HIIT is great and has its place in training. HIIT is time-effective, improves aerobic capacity, AND improves your anaerobic capacity more than LISS. It preps you for max effort exertion in ways that LISS cannot. However, HIIT is very intense when it is done properly and the necessary recovery is more likely to interfere with strength training. LISS is not as likely to interfere and still gives all the benefits that Nuckols discussed. It's easier to fit on any day in a programming routine.\n\nThere's a lot more in the Nuckols article that I did not include in the bullet points. Check it out.

The first realization was that neither of my friends were including me in this adventure. The second was why they hadn\u2019t included me. A slow yet consistent thought came to dominate my head. It was the realization that I was not seen by other people as I viewed myself. As that truth unfolded in my mind, I slowly came to the realization that I was living a lie.\n\nI believed that I was in shape. I believed I was athletic. I believed I was tough. As much as I believed these things to be true, my friends did not. The realization that my friends didn't think I would be interested in, or able to complete, an obstacle course race was compounded by the fact that I was realizing that my self-image was not accurate. Talk about a shock to the system! The image my brain created and the image my eyes saw in a mirror was not a true representation of who I was. My mind had created a shield. My friends accidentally shattered my manufactured self- image as I quietly looked down into an over filled plate of self-realization.\n\nAs they talked, and I listened, something happened. Something quick came alive in my head. That something made me say out loud, \u201cI will run it with you,\u201d to the apparent shock of my wife and the rest of the table. Maybe it was denial being pushed into realization. Maybe it was false pride making me say something out of haste. The thought that I was not perceived by the others as I perceived myself was shocking and eye opening to me. The call to arms was sounded, although unintentionally. My brain responded confidently.\n\nWhatever it was that made me speak up, I am grateful for it. Now, I had a goal. I had a timeline. I said to myself, \"Quit lying to yourself and get to work. It is time to be the person who you have been pretending to be.\u201d All of these positive affirmations and goal setting were great except for one thing. I had one more realization coming around the bend and it was the most important one yet.\n\nOver the following weeks, the barriers that had kept me from making a commitment like this to myself were falling down as the number of sit-ups, pull-ups, and miles I could jog increased. As all the excuses melted away, their absence reveled the one main reason that had kept me from making this commitment before now. I was afraid.\n\nI was afraid of failure and comfortable with mediocrity. That fear had paralyzed my ability to achieve anything past the self-imposed limitations that I had lived in for way too long. Gradually, I came to realize that I was showing myself that I could run an obstacle race and not be afraid. The commitment to the physical training and practice of overcoming obstacles led me to a point where the fear of failure was not nearly as strong as the rewarding feeling I received when I climbed my 1st rope, or completed my 1st mile run without stopping. Minor successes were destroying decades old fear and I came to love that feeling.\n\nI completed the first obstacle race I ran. The race showed me that I had accomplished something significant. Did I come in first place overall? No. Did I win? Yes. I outran the only opponent I really had when I stood at the starting line \u2013 the old me. Needless to say, the commitment I made to myself has stuck. Obstacle racing , the exercise, and diet I have adopted to help me run more in the future will be the vehicle to make me physically and mentally healthier.\n\nIf I can offer some advice to those people who see themselves in the \u201cold me\u201d description it would be simply this: You don\u2019t need to be able run 6 miles, you don\u2019t need to be able to do 20 burpees, you don\u2019t need to be able to climb a 20 foot rope. You do need to be honest with yourself about why you aren't trying to do the things you really want to do. After all, you are reading this for a reason.

I could have made a lot of progress and been pretty strong during this time, but the lack of education around nutrition and exercise really did not allow me to excel. The entire time I was in, I floated around 200 pounds until it came time to cut weight for PT tests, which I only ever passed by the skin of my teeth. As I was getting out, I started gaining quite a bit of weight just because I was no longer being required to exercise for a few hours a day.\n\n\nBy 2014 I was not much better off than when I had joined the military. I was up to 230 pounds in July, and started a new job which allowed me to walk around a lot more than I had been, and in the downtime I was able to browse this subreddit(which I think is truly the number one reason why I was able to stick with this). I wanted to lose a little bit of weight but really had no intention of becoming very involved in the way of fitness. In August, a coworker of mine had mentioned that they were going to Planet Fitness and the price sounded really appealing, so I signed up for a year contract.\n\n\nAs anyone who has browsed this subreddit for a day knows, a 5x5 program is pretty much the standard for beginners looking to get stronger. I REALLY wanted to do one of those, but Planet Fitness completely lacks the necessary equipment to do one properly. So I found a dumbbell program that I thought would cover everything I'd need. It was basically a M-Upper W-Lower F-Upper split for about 7 months, and doing some runs before and after my lifting.\n\nAt this point I was really focused on losing weight, and dropped from 230 to 190 pounds between August and early January by meticulously logging my calories in MyFitnessPal. I was consuming 1600 a day without many missteps. I was consistently losing 1-3 pounds a week and was overjoyed by the progress I was seeing. The best part about the dieting was how little effort I really had to put in to make it work. I was eating fast food, mostly Taco Bell, at least 3-5 times per week, but since the calories for those places are so readily available I had 0 issues keeping myself in line.\n\n\nBy January I was becoming I started becoming interested in running some 5k races, and started training a little more for those, with less focus on the lifting. I still went to the gym, but at this point I'd reached the max weight on the dumbbells for my DB bench press(75 lb per). From January to March/April I'd been able to get my 5k time from about 40 minutes to 26, and dropped from 190 to 168 at my lowest weight. I was attempting to do a 5k race at least once every week or two, but once May hit, availability started to taper off near me. Probably something to do with temperatures in Texas? This is the point where I feel like shit started to pick up quick.\n\n\nI bought a house in March, and my workout buddy and I decided to split the cost of a cage and 300 lb barbell set. We started SL5x5 in May(with the bar) and at the same time I decided to eat more so I could get the most out of my noob gains. At this time I'd never even touched a barbell except to attempt a bench press a long time ago. I'd never done a single squat, deadlift, ohp, or row in my life.\n I consistently was able to keep putting weight on the bar from May-August, where I kind of stalled a bit with the following lift numbers - \n\nSquat - 250lb 5x5\n\nBench - 205lb 5x5\n\nDeadlift - 315lb 1x5\n\nOHP - 115lb 5x5\n\nRow - 170lb 5x5\n\n\n\nI went from 168-190 by the middle of August, and my progress had stalled,so I got a little bored. Decided to move on to PHUL to mix it up a bit. I Had a lot of fun with this routine, and noticed some size gains(especially legs), but really didn't make a lot of progress numbers wise on any lifts. I just kind of felt tired all the time with the increased volume. We ran this program from August until late November, when we decided to start doing the Texas Method, which I'm currently on.\n\n\nThe time spent doing PHUL leg volume did wonders for my squat and deadlift once I actually started on a more clear cut linear progression again. My numbers went to\n\nSquat - 250lb 5x5-> 295lb 5x5\n\nBench - 205lb 5x5->220lb 5x5\n\nDeadlift - 315lb 1x5->365lb 1x5\n\nOHP - 115lb 5x5->125lb 5x5\n\n\nWith my numbers improving as they did, I decided to test out my 1RM to see if I could manage to get a 1000 lb total on New Years Eve.  I managed to get a 350lb squat, 265 BP, and kind of took it easy on deadlift and did 385 to make it exact. I'm pretty confident I can do around 410 as a max deadlift, but probably not within the same hour as a max squat. I was so excited about being able to do that. I was pumped, and sore as hell for the next few days.\n\n\nWhat surprised me the most about all of this is how simple the whole process was. Lose weight: count calories. Lose weight while lifting: count calories, count protein. Gain strength: eat more, count protein. All of this information being in the wiki and seeing it consistently work, and how well it works really kept me motivated the whole time. Having workout buddies that were consistent in working out with me was also pretty critical to my success. Watching other people progress with you while doing the exact same stuff is pretty amazing.\n\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nCount calories, lift weights, read the wiki, find people to be active with, and have fun!\n\n**Possible Bulge Warning**\n[Progress pics](http://imgur.com/a/MRA8s)\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "16 Month transformation, 230->170->188, and beginner's progress to 1000 lb club", "post_ups": 2557, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3znn0e/16_month_transformation_230170188_and_beginners/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:13.604003", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "nerveendingstory", "post_created_utc": 1424103408.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1424135272.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2w35bc", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 430, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2541, "post_selftext": "**My Story**\n\nI've always struggled with my weight. Ever since middle school I was self-conscious about being overweight. It seemed like I tried everything but eating right and exercising. I was one of those people who just wanted a quick solution. I would even starve myself but ended up so hungry that I would go on an all out binge.\n\nIn 2006, I bought The Biggest Loser book. This was the first time something actually clicked with me. I did the diet and all exercises for 3 months straight. The plan consisted of a ton cardio and light resistance training. The diet used a formula (CW x 7 = Calories in a day), meaning at one point I was only eating 1260 calories a day. I went from 260 to 180. Looking back, that was pretty drastic but I was only 23 and my body responded very quickly to the program. I was skinny for the first time in my life with no muscle. At the end of the program I didn't know what to do and reverted back to my old habits.\n\nOver 8 years, I gained 50 pounds. I was in complete denial. My thought process was, \"Well, as long as I'm not as big as that (morbidly obese) guy, I'll be fine.\" My excuses included, \"I don't have enough time to work out,\" or \"I'm too poor to buy healthy food.\"\n\nI saw an ad for P90X3 which is a shorter version of P90X. I tried doing P90X before and was somewhat successful. I enjoyed the workouts but they were to long at an hour and a half. So this 30 minute version I could go for. I ordered it and did the first two weeks and stopped. I don't have a reason or an excuse for stopping, I just did. For 3 months. \n\n**May 2014**\n\nM/30/5'11\n\nStarting weight: 230\n\nIn May, I decided to give it another go...not to lose weight just to tone what little muscle I had. That was the plan until I took my before pictures.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/kiCx5\n\nThese pictures absolutely devastated me. I couldn't be in denial any more I was ready to change.\n\nI cleared out my garage, hooked up a TV and bought a pull-up bar and a dumbbell set. I started the P90X3 classic routine thinking I would ultimately fail but this time was different. I kept going. 6 days a week. one month down. two months down. I was thinking I could actually do this! My mind was set to finish!\n\nDiet for my first round was a little restrictive. I followed The Biggest Loser formula to figure my daily caloric intake. The only thing I tracked was calories not protein, carbs or fat. Very little processed food, high protein/low carb. Typical meals included:\n\n*Breakfast-* 1/2 cup of oatmeal or Bran flakes, Banana\n\n*Lunch-* 4 oz. chicken Breast, 1 Cup Broccoli, 1/2 cup of cottage Cheese or String Cheese, Apple\n\n*Dinner-* 3 oz 90/10 Ground beef, Spiraled Squash, Spaghetti Sauce\n\n*Snack-* Lots of Watermelon\n\nI finished the first round of P90X at 190. I decided to keep up the program and finished my second round at 159.\n\nThere was a point at the beginning of my third round where The Biggest Loser formula was no longer working. I was eating about 1200 calories a day while doing these extreme workouts. I was tired and experiencing dizzy spells. I knew I needed to eat more calories but I was so afraid of gaining weight that I couldn't bring myself to do it. I joined /r/fitness and read a lot of posts on nutrition. I get excited about Nutrition Tuesdays. Here, people were eating anywhere from 2400 to 3500 calories a day and also tracking macros, which I've never heard of. So I figured, what the hell, I guess I could afford to gain weight. In my last round I upped my calories each phase and started watching my macros. I am currently eating 2400 calories and eating about 180g of protein a day. I plan on increasing this even more when I start my next workout regiment. Meals for this round included:\n\n*Breakfast-* 1/2 cup of oatmeal, 2 eggs, glass of milk or latte\n\n*Lunch-* 6 oz. chicken Breast, Salad, 1/2 cup of cottage Cheese or String Cheese, Apple\n\n*Dinner-* Chicken Tortilla Soup, Fajitas, 90/10 stuffed mushroom and swiss burgers.\n\n*Snack-* Whey Protein, Peanut Butter Sandwich, greek yogurt\n\n**February 2015**\n\nI just finished my 3rd round of P90X3 and I have no plans on quitting now.\n\nM/31/5'11\n\nCurrent Weight: 166.8\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/4lQ64\n\n**Things that have helped me succeed**\n\n* I had to find a workout plan that fit my schedule starting out but I think that will change the fitter I get. I'll have to adapt my schedule to my workout routine.\n* Doing my workouts at home I had to find a private, dedicated space. I park the car in the street now and use my garage\n* Learn to cook.

The very high level overview of this cut is as follows: 1600 calories/day, bro-split with added cardio, minimal loss of strength, now aesthetically content. Pictures speak a thousand words and are always what I look for in these threads, so here are the before/middle/after pictures:\n\n[Resting](http://i.imgur.com/VuP6gJM.png)\n\n[Ab Flexed](http://i.imgur.com/p8pJWTu.jpg) \n\n[Arm Flexed](http://i.imgur.com/fT7mVQQ.png)\n\n[Pump]( http://i.imgur.com/JlXFjqX.png)\n\n###Progress and Numbers\nI started this cut on January 4th for two reasons: (1) I had never cut before and wanted to see how I could push myself; and (2) I am a senior in college and for spring break we are heading to Punta Cana, and therefore I was all about the aesthetic look. Spring break was 9 weeks away so I did my research, and jumped right into a cutting regimen.\n\nMy starting weight on January 4th was 199 pounds \u2013 stepping on the scale the first day was pretty shocking, I hadn\u2019t weighed myself in a very long time and was shocked to see how high I had gotten. All that did was motivate me more to cut. 8 weeks later, my ending weight was 178 pounds. This was a loss of 21 pounds in 8 weeks, which comes out to roughly 2.6 pounds/week. While this probably resulted in a loss of muscle mass, I am content with the progress I made and retained a lot of my strength. Here are my lift numbers at the start and end:\n\n*Bench*\n\n* Start: 5x5 @225lbs\n* End 4x5 @225lbs\n\n*Squat*\n\n* Start: 5x5 @225lbs\n* End: 5x5 @225lbs\n\n*Deadlift*\n\n* Start: 5x5 @ 315lbs\n* End: 5x5 @315lbs\n\n*OHP*\n\n* 5x5 @135lbs\n* 5x5 @125lbs\n\nHere is a graph of my weight progress throughout the cut.\n\n[Weight Loss](http://i.imgur.com/mfxiRYs.png)\n\n###Routine\n\nFor the majority of these 8 weeks I followed a 4-day bro-split. This consisted of (1) Triceps and Chest, (2) Biceps and grip/forearm work, (3) Deadlifts and back, and (4) Squats and other leg stuff. After I did the four days, I would start back up at day 1 regardless of if there was a rest day in between. For the major lifts such as bench, squats, deadlift, ohp, etc. I followed a 5x5 set outline keeping the weight heavy and consistent, and attempted to keep the weight heavy for all other lifts to preserve my strength. \n\nStarting in late January, I started adding structured cardio to my routine. I have always been active and have maintained a decent level of endurance from playing soccer, so I took to running as my source for cardio. I went with the C25k (Couch to 5k) Program and started a couple weeks in. This consisted of running 3x a week. Soon after being able to run a 5k, I moved on to a higher frequency of running and also distance ran. I am currently training for a 10k in 3 weeks. Here was a typical week late into the cut:\n\n*Monday*\n\n* Morning: Treadmill run for 45min, Core exercises for 30 min\n* Afternoon: 1 - Triceps and Chest \n\n*Tuesday*\n\n* Morning: Cross training cardio for 45min, Core exercises for 30 min\n* Afternoon: 2 - Biceps and grip/forearm work\n\n*Wednesday*\n\n* Morning: Treadmill run for 45 min, Core exercises for 30 min\n* Afternoon: 3 - Deadlifts and back\n\n*Thursday*\n\n* Morning: Rest\n* Afternoon: 4 -Squats and other leg stuff\n\n*Friday*\n\n* Morning: Treadmill run for 45min, Core exercises for 30 min\n* Afternoon: Start back with 1 \u2013 Triceps and Chest\n\n*Saturday*\n\n* Morning: Treadmill run for 30 min, cross train 30 min, core exercises for 30 min\n* Afternoon: Rest\n\n*Sunday*\n\n* Morning: Rest\n* Afternoon: 2 \u2013 Biceps and grip/forearm work\n\nHere\u2019s a graph of my total distance traveled per day throughout the cut, as well as a graph of my minimum and maximum heart rate throughout the cut. One thing I\u2019d like to highlight is my average resting HR went from about 55 BPM to 45BPM, with a couple outlier days thrown in between.\n\n[Distance Traveled](http://i.imgur.com/GZ7xi4S.png)\n\n[Heart Rate](http://i.imgur.com/OqIdsId.png)\n\n###Diet\n\nOnce I set my caloric goal intake, I ate that much every day for the next 8 weeks. People have recommended tapering down your calories from what you\u2019ve been eating down to your goal, but I found it was easiest to just go cold turkey and jump right into it. Based off of my TDEE and my time frame for weight loss, I set around a 1000 calorie deficit and set my daily intake at 1600 calories. This deficit would mean I lose around 2lbs per week, perhaps a little more once I started doing cardio. I set my macros at a 50/30/20 ratio for Protein/Carbs/Fat and actually stuck to this pretty strictly. It put me at around 200g of protein per day which is about 1.1g/lb. The only change I would make to this diet in hindsight is adding more fat, because I for sure did not get the recommended 0.4g/lb. This caused minimal temperament changes (I did get agitated easier while cutting) however it did decrease libido. \n\nWhile I initially did not increase my consumption on days when I did cardio workouts in addition to lifting, once I was hitting 300+ kcal workouts I would normally add 200-300 calorie to my day to ensure I wasn\u2019t losing too much weight too fast, and therefore losing muscle mass. Essentially took the equation that (GoalCalories = FoodIntake \u2013 Exercise) and made sure I was right at 1600 every day. However, since all calorie counting is an estimate, I normally would undershoot how much I expended. A typical meal plan would look like this:\n\n*Breakfast (450 Cals)*\n\n* Jimmy Dean Delight BFast Sandwich \u2013 250 \n* Pure Protein Bar \u2013 200 \n\n*Lunch (420 Cals)*\n\n* Premier Protein Shake \u2013 160\n* 2x Chicken Patty or Chicken Sausage \u2013 260\n\n*Dinner (730 Cals)*\n\n* 8 oz. Chicken Breast \u2013 240\n* 1.5 Cup Frozen Broccoli \u2013 50\n* Premier Protein Shake \u2013 160\n* Pure Protein Bar \u2013 200\n* Danon Light and Fit Greek Yogurt - 80\n\n*Snacks on Cardio Days*\n\n* Bell Pepper \u2013 50\n* Canned Alaskan Salmon \u2013 180\n\nHere\u2019s a graph of my active calories, resting calories, and total calories burned according to my Apple watch. This is not a reliable measurement however it does show some general trends throughout the cut. \n\n[Calories Per Day](http://i.imgur.com/QiFCvbS.png)\n\n###Supplements\n\nAside from protein, amino acids, and preworkout, I had a daily regimen of vitamin supplements to ensure I was hitting all my micronutrient goals as well as just attempting to maintain a healthy body while eating at such a deficit. I can\u2019t guarantee the efficacy of any of them, but if you have any questions about them feel free to ask. The supplements were:\n\n*Morning*\n\n* 1x Vitamin D3 5000IU\n* 1x Vitamin K 2700mcg\n* 1x Milk Thistle 250mg\n* 2x Burdock Root 430mg\n* 1x Airborne Chewable\n* 1x Fish Oil 1000mg\n\n*Evening*\n\n* 2x Orange Triad Multivitamin\n* 1x Fish Oil 1000mg\n* 1x Milk Thistle 250mg\n* 1x HMB 1000mg\n\nIf anyone has any questions, feel free to ask!\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "8 Week Cut M/22/5\u201911\u201d From 199 to 178", "post_ups": 2544, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/48dnk1/8_week_cut_m22511_from_199_to_178/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:13.604003", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Rick_Persson", "post_created_utc": 1472378168.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1472635136.0, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "4zyt4f", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 512, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2542, "post_selftext": "First, Some background: \nI had always been skinny growing up(too much video games), when I was 17 I got a gym membership that I only used when going with friends, I had no clue of what I was doing and so I made absolutely zero gains. Half a year later I gave the weights another try, this time without the friends involved.\n\nSo it all started summer 2013, since i started out very skinny, I had a lot of time to be in a gaining phase before eventually having to diet. I weighed just below 110 lb at 5ft8 when I started out. I had no clue about calories when starting out, but i knew i had to eat way more then the last time around. That first summer of lifting, in an actual caloric surplus gained me 20 solid pounds. At this time I was following a typical 5 day split(All routines are below).\n\nAs time passed I got more and more enthusiastic about making progress, so i started tracking calories, but still very loosely, just making sure that i was eating at a surplus. Having always been skinny I did not have a lot of appetite, therefor I had to force eat a lot(I pretty much ate anything and everything during this time). I eventually reached 190(my goal was actually 200), but I realised at this time that I had already over reached on this single bulk! I was straight up fat.\n\nSo I started dieting at 190 and In my head i thought that i would be ripped at 170...oh how wrong i was. My diet lasted for just over 8 months, and i got A LOT better at dieting as time passed. As ripped as i thought I would be at 170, I was at 145. \n\n> This is what a typical day of dieting at 2000 calories would look like:\n\n\n>> Breakfast(Pre workout): Oats, banna, blueberries, and my secret to dieting: Peanut flour(this shit is golden)\n\n>> Lunch(Post workout): Cod with plain cooked potatoes and broccoli\n\n>> Dinner: Chicken/steak/beef and plain cooked potatoes\n\n>> Snack: Quark(cottage cheese) with cinnamon and blueberries\n\nAs you can see I ate quite clean during my diet, that way I got the most satisfied! (plain cooked Potatoes where definetly the biggest source of carbs during my diet, they are as low as it gets in calories/100g)\n\nEverything I weighted on a scale and tracked with myfitnesspal. I always had a post workout shake after every workout, consisting of 10g creatine and 2 and a half scoops of whey. And for supplements while where at it, I only take whey protein, creatine and a pre-workout(very handy when dieting IMO) I was probably on 200mg+ caffeine every day.\n\n\nCurrently I am reverse dieting from my 8 month diet, so that i can begin a lean gaining phase as lean as possible.(I am adding 100 calories every 6th day, it should take me a month to get into a surplus)\n\n\n\n\nHere is a short video of my journey: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9PzQW2FvpQ \n\nBefore lifting(fall 2013): http://imgur.com/a/8rmCo\n\nAfter the noobie gains phase, about 9 months into lifting: http://imgur.com/a/0P1UP\n\nAs a skinny guy, i never thought i would end up like this: http://imgur.com/a/jAaCv\n\nAfter dieting for 8 months: http://imgur.com/a/wC6FZ http://imgur.com/a/nKWFm http://imgur.com/a/x5e53\n\nMy workout routines:\n> 1st year of lifting (5 day split):\n\n1.Chest and tri\n\n2.Back and bi\n\n3.Legs\n\n4.Shoulders and traps\n\n5.Arms\n\nrest\n\nrest\n\n\n\n> 2nd year - 4 day split\n\n1.Chest and tri\n\n2.Back and bi\n\n3.Shoulder and traps\n\n4.Legs\n\nrest\n\n\n\n> 3rd year - 3day split(PPL)\n\n1.Push\n\n2.Legs\n\n3.Pull\n\n\nAnd this is the routine that I am now following, it is a modified PPL with a 4th day of push.\nI set this up myself, and I do not recommend you follow it, unless you want to focus on Chest, shoulders and tri's!\n\n* Push (chest focus)\n* Back\n* Rest\n* Push (shoulder focus)\n* Legs\n* Rest\n\nrepeat\n\n\n> **1.Push (chest)**\nBench 5x5>2x8> dips 4x8> behind the neck ohp 4x10> 1triceps of choice 5x8>1side laterals of choice 5x10 (25sets total)\n\n\n>> **2.Back + Abs**\nPull ups 3x8(weighted)2x8(drop 10kg)>bb row 5x8> 1pulldown of choice 3x8s> 1back exercise of choice 3x8> 1curl of choice 4x8> 1hammercurl of choice 4x8> 1abs of choice 5x10 (29sets total)\n\n\n**3.rest**\n\n\n> **4.Push (shoulders)** \nOhp 5x5> narrow bench 5x8> incline db press 5x8> upright row 4x10> 1triceps of choice 4x8> facepull 4x10 (27sets total)\n\n\n>> **5.Legs + calves**\nSquats/front squats 5x5> 1 compound of choice (i.e lunges) 4-5sets>1quad of choice 5x8> 1hamstring of choice 5x8> calves 5x6 standing and 5x12 seated (30 sets total)\n\n\n\n**6.rest**\n\n\nThis routine is heavily focused on \"push\" and in my opinion it has a lot of rest. Its basically 2 days on and one off, and the volume is quite moderate. This is how it looks for now, when i stall, I will increase volume where I see fit.\n\n\n\nEDIT: THANKS FOR THE HUGE RESPONSE, I MADE AN ALBUM WITH SOME MORE PICS HERE: http://imgur.com/a/x5e53\n\nI WILL SERIOUSLY TRY TO ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS!! cheers, we can all reach our goals!\n\nEDIT2: HUGE THANKS FOR GOLD!!(I will find you, and I will thank you, anonymouse person!)", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "3 year teen transformation, start 110>bulk to 190>diet to 145.

I lost 55lb (25kg) by getting off my ass, joining a gym and (mostly) cutting out the crap food. Yes it was hard, yes I sometimes went backwards, but most importantly, yes it was worth it. Ive gone from being unhappy and unhealthy to the complete opposite in twelve months and have never been happier. \n\nBefore and after http://imgur.com/gKthfhP\n\nEdit: Holy shit!!! Seriously, thanks guys. Thats some damn kind words. \n\nOk so I know I didn't put enough info initially so here's here how I did it.\n\nI moved across the country where the climate is very very hot and dry. So naturally I drank a lot of beer, pretty much daily. We're talking about at least 6 bottles daily (adds up, as you can see). With all the extra drinking came the hungover food runs...usually involving fried chicken. I was smoking like a chimney and not exercising, probably using the heat as an excuse.\n\nWhen I moved back to chilly Melbourne I joined a gym. I started off going maybe once every second day, but would only go on the treadmill for half an hour or so and call it a day.\n\nOnce I got some confidence up I started joining the group classes. I became addicted to Les Mills Body Pump (an all over body weights/cardio class) and I continue to go at least twice a week. It's so much fun and I'm starting to see real results from it.\n\nI also started with the couch 2 10k app. When I started, I couldnt run 30 seconds without losing ny breath. I can now run 8km easy, and recently hit 10km. I don't think id have kept going without it - it really helps having a goal and I like being told when I'm half way. I plan on training for a half marathon next. \n\nI want to lose a bit more fat, then get started on some serious weight training. Any advice on where to start would be much appreciated!\n\nIn regards to my diet, obviously I've cut back alot on the drinking, and have quit smoking. I still drink occasionally, just not every day. \n\nDuring the week, I'm fairly strict with my diet. I need to learn to be more creative with my meals though...one week all I ate was kangaroo sausages and steamed green veg. Not very exciting. I've cut back on potatoes, which are my favorite thing ever. I have them maybe once a week now. I've swapped pasta for soba noodles. I eat alot more veg and chicken breast.\n\nLong story short, I could be alot more strict with my diet, and could exercise more. But I look how far I've come and know I'm doing something right.\n\nLooking forward to showing you all what I can do this year!\n\nThanks again for all the love. \n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Same girl, 55lb lighter", "post_ups": 2532, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/23e1px/same_girl_55lb_lighter/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:13.604003", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Triseult", "post_created_utc": 1399456995.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1399487584.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "24xvf6", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 1020, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2536, "post_selftext": "It happened again today at the gym. A guy was using the power rack when I arrived, so I sat nearby and waited. After his sets, he approached me with a friendly smile. He struck a conversation, then dropped this on me:\n\n\"You should focus on cardio for now,\" he told me. \"It'll speed up your weight loss. Lifting won't help as much.\"\n\nI said 'thank you,' I smiled, and I started loading the barbell. I've learned to just shut up and nod when I get unsolicited advice. It's the fatty's curse at the gym: nobody is laughing at you, but they always figure they know better than you what *you* need.\n\nIf I had wanted to reply to the dude's advice, there's a few things I would have told him. I would have explained that he doesn't know a few things about me:\n\n- I used to weigh 80 lbs more than I do now. I may look fat to him, but this is me at my fittest in a long, long time.\n- I happen to do cardio, as my first passion is distance running. I ran 25 km (edit: in one run) last summer, but I realized my weight was holding me back as a runner, so I decided to solve the weight issue once and for all. Weight training is a way for me to maintain muscle mass while I lose weight, and I'm not doing cardio while I learn my program.\n- I've lost 15 lbs in 2 months of counting calories, eating clean, and going to the gym, so why the hell would I change anything?\n- One big reason I lift weights is that I fell in love with lifting. Why the hell should I stop? My stats are going up even though I'm cutting. Squatting and deadlifting give me a rush, and I'm getting a shitload of health benefits from my new strength.\n\nThe first time I received unsolicited advice, it really hit me hard; I had second thoughts about lifting for two days, then thought 'fuck it' and kept at it. If it were people mocking me, I'd probably feel encouraged out of a desire to prove them wrong. But when people come at me with misguided kindness, it can really make me doubt myself.\n\nSo there you have it. My advice to any experienced lifter who sees us fatties and DYELs struggle with our program is this:\n\n1. **Encouragement is always welcome.** As long as it's genuine and not condescending, we'll appreciate it. Don't feel you have to, though; we don't *need* you to cheer us, it's just nice when someone does it.\n2. **Be careful with unsolicited advice.** If someone asks and seems to really care, then go ahead and be as harsh as you want. Otherwise, just strike a conversation and let us bring it up if we want it.\n3. **Don't presume you know our story and our goals.** You have *no idea* where we started and where we're going. Don't assume we just woke up last week and decided to stop eating junk and lose weight.\n\nThanks for listening!\n\nP.S.: Yes, I realize the irony of giving unsolicited advice against giving unsolicited advice.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nWow, that blew up way more than I expected. Thanks for the discussion! Just want to clarify a few points:\n\n- The guy giving me advice today wasn't an asshole. I believe he genuinely wanted to help. He made a few assumptions about me, but he wanted to help. That's my point: if I were being mocked in the gym, I wouldn't give a damn. But getting advice that makes me realize you think I don't belong in the weight room can be a bummer.\n\n- I'm not losing sleep over this, nor am I angry at the guy. I just wrote this post because it struck me as an interesting point of discussion for this, a fitness-related subreddit. /r/fitness has been instrumental in giving me the knowledge and courage to lift, so this is where I come to process stuff. If you think that's not worth a post, downvote and move on.\n\n- Yeah, I should have talked to him about it. Call it [esprit d'escalier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esprit_d%27escalier).

I was astonished to note that it read 250lbs. Having spent most of my youth as a twigling and most of my early adult years at around 215lbs, it was now apparent that something had to be done about the human milk bag that I had become. With my new found self-loathing I was ready to begin my journey into the strange new world of healthy eating. \n\n**Changing Habits**\n\nI, like many desperate folks at the end of December decided to cast my lot into the cliche and often ill advised *New Years Resolution*. I downloaded My Fitness Pal to begin tracking my calories and to figure out my TDEE after consulting a friend who had had great success doing the same. I set the parameters to 2lbs a week at \u2018lightly active\u2019 Now it was simply a matter of willpower to remain focused and eat at a caloric deficit day in and out. My typical day for the first several months would look something like this and consist of between 1800 and 2300 cals:\n\nBreakfast:\n2 eggs\n1 slice of rye bread\nTea with milk\n\nLunch:\n150g of chicken with hot sauce\n85g carrots\n\nDinner:\n150g Chicken\nMass of veggies\n\nNight Snack:\nCelery\nCheese whiz, cottage cheese, greek yoghurt \n\n**Mistakes Were Made**\n\nDo I have any regrets? Yes a few. There were days when I was not eating nearly enough (1500-1700cals) and trying to train. These days felt wasted a lot of the time and I spent many a gym trip fatigued. In the beginning I was pumped so full of motivation that it didn\u2019t bother me for the first few months but in mid April I encountered some heavy stress from external events in my life and relapsed for a few weeks, gaining several pounds. This may have been avoidable if I had been on a more tolerable caloric deficit.\n\n**Mantra**\n\nWhat I have come to believe is basically the same mumbo jumbo that is constantly spouted on this subreddit all of the time. Motivation is for suckers and when it runs out you better have established habits, ritual even, that you are going to be willing to stick to when things get tough. Thus discipline>motivation. Next I firmly believe consistency will always out achieve intensity.. Finally I believe that in the grand scheme of things that your diet is at least as important as what you do in the gym. \n\n**Regimen**\n\n*PHUL*\n\nMy workouts are pretty basic. I squat, deadlift, OHP, bench and have now tried to focus on some arm work because I neglected the poor Dostovei\u2019s for too long.\n\nLeg day example:\n\nSquat:\n135x12\n185x12\n225x6\n275x2x4\n245x5\n\nDeadlift:\n135x12\n225x12\n315x6\n365x3x2\n315x10\n\nLeg extensions:\n4x12\n\nLeg Curl:\n4x12\n\n\nUpper Body day:\n\nSuperset Bench:\n135x12\n185x10\n225x5\n245x3x3\n225x3\n\nSuperset Pullup:\n10x5\n\nSS Sitting military press:\n60\u2019sx8x5\n\nSS Bent over row:\n135x12\n185x5\n205x3\n225x2\n185x5\n\nCurls and tri extensions until the cows come home\n\n\n**Photographic Evidence**\n\n[Before and After](https://imgur.com/gallery/z8eGV)\n\n**Where to Next**\n\nAs of this week I have begun eating at maintenance and am trying to figure out what my calorie surplus is going to look like for a bulking phase. I hope to add some mass and look forward to some strength gains. If anyone has some physique critiques, advice on a good program or any other words of encouragement I would love to hear them! \n\n**Special Thanks**\n\nI would just like to thank /r/fitness because honestly my biggest motivation for getting fit again was just simply wanting to make a transformation post that would hopefully motivate somebody else to make a change in their life. I have always loved looking at these posts and they have really inspired me to strive to be a stronger and healthier human being. Cheers Fitit. \n\n**Edit:** I've been asked a lot of the same questions so I will try to answer some of them here.\n\nHow many days did I go to the gym a week?\nTypically I went 4 times a week. Some weeks I went 2 or 3, or 0. Some I went 5.\n \n\nWhat was I eating?\nI tried to do 2 things. I eliminated all of the processed food out of my diet and have now become and excellent cook because of it. I stopped drinking pop/soda/cola completely. I did not want to restrict myself any further than that and fortunately did not have to. I ate the same thing for breakfast (eggs, toast, tea) and lunch (chicken or  tuna, carrots or celery) every single day for those 10 months. For dinner I ate fajitas, homemade pizza, stir fry, hamburgers, and pasta. I didn't do anything differently but I just ate much, much less. Instead of eating 3 hamburgers I ate 1. Instead of eating a small families worth of lasagna, I ate a small slice.\n\n\nDid I have cravings?\nNo I did not. I was not really intermittently fasting but I much prefer to save my calories until the end of the day when I had more willpower and after I had gone to the gym. If I eat a lot of food in the morning I find I am hungrier throughout the day. You need to find out what works for you.\n\n\nWhat was the hardest part of the journey?\nMy dad got really sick at one point and I stopped going to the gym for about 2 weeks so I could go down to the hospital to visit him. During this period I was stress eating as well. Fortunately some very talented surgeons saved his life and he has made a full recovery. I almost completely fell off the wagon at this time and it really stymied my progress.\n\n\nWhat do my typical workouts look like?\nI have a posted section about my workouts in my original write up. Generally I sweat but I don't kill myself. I take 3-5 min breaks between my primary lifts and a min to 90 seconds between my accessories. I also super set everything I do with the exception of squats and deadlifts.\n\n\nWhen did I focus on dieting?\nThis past January.\n\n\nTips for other people in my situation? \nMake small changes so that you can make a lifestyle change. Download My Fitness Pal, it is in my opinion the single most important fitness tool that exists and it is free. You are insane not to take advantage of it.\n\n\nDid I do cardio:\nNo. Zero treadmill, elliptical, stair climber, erg, or anything else. I played some tennis over the summer but that's it. In the past I had tried to lose weight using cardio but I had been *very* unsuccessful.

Flexibility does not come overnight. Or even over a month. It's a progression just like any workout. If you can't keep your heels on the floor, or your calves/shins hurts, or you can't stay below parallel for more than a few seconds, *work your way into it*. Start slowly. Lean on a wall as support to go deeper. Put a wooden block or rolled up towel under your heels for some help. Go at it slowly until you can hold a full squat and stay there for some amount of time. Then try to increase your stamina. \n\nAlso, my sincerest apologies for using the term Third-World. It's not meant to be offensive, so sorry if anyone took it that way. It's a layman's term and most people know it by that. If I had used something like \"full squat\" not everyone would have understood it from just the title. Just because the position is poorly named doesn't mean every connotation is bluntly offensive or racist. Sincerely, someone born in a Third-World country (Punjab). \n\n----\n\nLive and breathe the Third-World Squat. Do it everyday and stay in that position for 10+ minutes. Do it until you get to the point where squatting down feels more comfortable than sitting in a chair (trust me, it gets pretty comfortable). \n\nI see people in the gym every day with bad squat form caused by lack of flexibility. The only obstacle you want between you and your new Squat PR is that 5lbs of weight - not slightly stiff hip flexors or hamstrings. \n\nIf you don't feel comfortable squatting down without weights, then trying the same movement *with* weights isn't doing your muscles any justice. \n\ntl;dr: Become the TWS. \n\n**Edit 1:** [To the people with injuries](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2rkl54/want_to_get_better_at_squatting_do_thirdworld/cngy1xn?context=3)\n\n**Edit 2:** Doing TWSs helps your overall squat form because squatting is a natural movement that's supposed to take no effort. Babies squat when they're little. Old men squat around the world. People like us sit in chairs all day long causing some parts of our bodies to lose flexibility and proper range of motion. This could mean your hip flexors are tight, or your ankles, hamstrings, lower back, etc, etc. In order to keep your flexibility, just like muscles, you need to use it.\n\nBecoming more comfortable with TWSs means you're addressing your weaknesses. When you notice your initial pull during a deadlift is lacking, doing bad deadlifts isn't the most optimal way to get better at them. Sometimes you need to strech more so you can actually perform the full range of motion. In the deadlift example you might try doing deficit deadlifts, or trap-bar deadlifts. \n\n**Edit 3:** Use your common sense... If your knees hurt don't dive right into a full ass-to-ground squat. If they keep hurting no matter what you might have some other issues with your knee. Don't substitute reddit for your doctor's advice. And don't think this thread is meaningless because a select few individuals have genuine concerns with squatting.

I never realised how fat I was, maybe it was a bad angle as a smaller person took the picture but I thought \"that's it, im taking my diet more seriously\".   \nI was 106 kilos (234lbs) when I started my diet and Im a 6 foot 2 guy who's 27.  \nWell, I say started my diet but I had been dieting for a year, but I never lost any weight over that year.  \nI would always lose a little over the week but then put it all back on at the weekend when I would go out drinking one night. This kept on hapening until I finally thought \"is drinking really worth it?\"  \nSo I downloaded myfitnesspal, tracked all my calories, ate around 1900 calories a day, avoided alcohol completely, (it wasnt just the calories in the alcohol that was the problem, its that I always end up at a fast food place at 3am with no recolection of how I got there which ruins my diet), eat sweets less, and I work part time in a factory. I tracked my steps and it said I walked around 15000 steps one day just at work, and that was a fairly slow day, and im also always constantly moving and carrying heavy things like microwaves and vacuum cleaners etc.  \nSo now 45 days later im 89 kilos (196.5lbs) and I feel so much better about myself. lost 37.5lbs if that makes more sense (ironically used kg in the title to make things less confusing as we use pounds and stone in the UK).  \nAnd I never realised how many benifits there would be to stopping drinking. I can now stay awake past midnight if im out with my friends, I dont get hangovers, feel really hydrated as I just drink pepsi max (diet pepsi) all night, I remember the night, still laugh as much as I would if I was drinking, and Ive saved a shitload of money.  \nI didnt think the weight could come off that fast. I went to the doctor to talk about it and they said that my thyroid was a tiny bit high but the thing that controlls my thyroid was normal. So they said it wasnt anything to worry about. They also tested me for diabetes and scanned my heart and saw everything was fine.  \nYesterday a guy who used to work at my job came to visit, the last time I saw him was at the christmas party.     \nI said hi to him and he completely ignored me, I thought about how ignorant it was and it really annoyed me. But then later when I was working in the distance I heard him say \"That was Alex!?! He looks brand new!!!\" Haha.  \nJust to clarify, I mentioned something like this a week ago here asking if it was normal but because I wrote it in pounds instead of kilos and never gave information about my age, gender, starting weight etc all the messages were just people confused but they reccomended I went to a doctor to check it out.  \nEdit; added some info like lbs instead of kilos etc. \nBecause of popular demand heres a before and after pic   \nhttps://imgur.com/v6SjI3q", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "I somehow managed to lose 17 kilos in 45 days...", "post_ups": 2488, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4uu2jh/i_somehow_managed_to_lose_17_kilos_in_45_days/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:13.604003", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "ShutUpAndDoTheLift", "post_created_utc": 1546524785.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1546525005.0, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "ac622t", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 195, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2487, "post_selftext": "4 days before Christmas 2017 I was diagnosed with cancer of the testicles.  \n\nI was a typical \"Gym Powerlifter\".  What I mean by this is that I was decently strong, but heavily overweight.  After I was treated I not only continued trying to get stronger/better, but to also clean up a bit, move down to a more appropriate weight class, and maybe look a little better in the process.  I'd like to believe that in 2018 I accomplished most, if not all, of these goals.  Even if I did it in some...unconventional ways.\n\n***What everyone cares about first, pictures!***\n\nI didn't take a lot of pictures back then (being all fat and stuff), so you'll have to get what you get here.\n\nI'm 6'1\" BTW.\n\n[November 11 2017:](https://puu.sh/yjKO1/6802dc327c.png)  Its the closest I have to Christmas.  Around 310-320 lbs.  Somewhere between 1100 and 1200 gym total.\n\n[December 31 2018:](https://puu.sh/CpOeR/d978feb561.png) Taken just before going out to celebrate my 30th birthday (Jan1).  275 lbs. 1600ish gym total\n\n***How we got here***\n\nPretty much as soon as I got the news that I had cancer I started cutting weight.  there was a lot of pre-treatment things that needed to be done to try to secure expected experiences of life after my treatment (children for instance)  So up until March when I finally had my surgery, I continued following GZCL Rippler and cutting at around -700.  I made it to around 290-295 before surgery.\n\nMy first question after I was woken up after surgery was \"how soon can I lift?\" - 2 weeks apparently.  No compounds or abdominal activation for 8.\n\nSo despite how bad everything hurt, I drug myself to the gym 4 times a week during that 2 week period to just sit there for 30 minutes and keep myself in the habit of being there.  And to keep me from laying in bed and feeling sorry for myself.\n\nI gained back to about 300 during this 2 weeks, mostly from not moving and not eating very well (who knew).\n\nAs soon as I made it to 2 weeks I started basically working upper body and quad isolations.  Tried a few times to figure out a way to work back, but it just wasn't happening without flexing an ab and causing excruciating pain.  I did have about a 6\" incision trying to heal afterall.  I maintained as best I could during this time period, but ended up losing a bit of weight anyway.  Not the best idea for recovering from surgery, but it wasn't really intentional.  I was still getting the hang of manipulating my diet/weight at this point.\n\nI hit 8 weeks and got right back on the Rippler and right back to cutting. \n\n When I got down to 290 lbs, I decided to start working with a coach to prep for a powerlifting meet, so I swapped to his programming.  I figured if I wanted to be a powerlifter I should probably actually powerlift.\n\nI maintained at 290lbs all the way until about October at which point I told my coach that I wanted to go ahead and make weight so I wouldn't have to stress so much about it during my upcoming meet prep.\n\nI went on a very strict 1500 calories, 250g of protein diet.  Consisting of mostly shakes and chicken.  And pickles.  See pickles are zero calories (or close enough) and it kind of feels like you're eating.  So I ate a bunch of them to keep my sanity.  During this month long suicide cut, u/benchpauper started a religion around pickles.  I'm still not sure I completely understand it.\n\nI continued going to the gym 4-5x a week during this cut though my volume and intensity dropped off severely.  I also dropped deadlift for a back isolation day during this time frame as I did not feel like I was strong enough at this calorie level to safely perform the movement after about the first 7 days.\n\nBy the end of October I weighed 260lbs.  Ate a bunch of carbs for a weekend with zero intention of controlling what I ate and hit 268 after full refeed.  Not too bad.  Over November and December, I ate to gain back up to 275 where I'm now maintaining until my meet in April.  Still following coaches program instead of GZCL.\n\nCurrent Caloric intake is between 4500 and 5000 calories per day and the only macro I track outside of that is 250g of protein.\n\nWorkout program varies from day to day based on my performance and my coach changes it on the fly.  But the days remain roughly the same.\n\nTues:  Volume Bench for compound and chest/tri isolation\n\nWed:  Pullups for compound and back/bi isolation\n\nThurs:  Max Effort bench for compound and shoulder isolation\n\nSun:  Squat/DL for compound and quad/ham isolation\n\nFor anyone wanting to compete, I cant recommend enough that you get a coach if you can afford it.  I didn't have any major issues with form on any of the lifts, but its astounding what small tweaks from an expert standing right next to you can do.  My squat has gone from my weakest (comparatively) lift to my strongest by far.  425 around the time of the diagnosis to 600+ now and most of that progress came in the first 2 months of being coached.  Nevermind the fact that squats aren't just completely miserable anymore.  (Just mostly miserable)\n\nHopefully I didn't miss anything.  I'm sure if I did, someone will point it out or ask and I can edit it in or answer in a comment.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "2018: From a fatty with cancer to a not-so-fat powerlifter.

I have been doing something similar lately so I thought I would offer advice from my own experients to correct posture; in my case anterior pelvic tilt, forward head and rounded shoulders. Classic caveman office worker!  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe FAQ's here and other guides gave me a solid starting point so I have boiled down a routine that works well for me and has seen good results in a short amount of time. This is not to say it will be best for everyone and their particular physiology.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**These resources are invaluable:**  \n[FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_fix_my_poor_posture.3F)  \n[Neanderthal no more](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance_repair/neanderthal_no_more_part_i)  \n[Alan Thrall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEn61BL4Nwk)  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI won't go into explanations as these are covered better by others in the above links but instead just give the exercises and some notes. \n\n&nbsp; \n\n**Anterior pelvic tilt**  \nGlute squeeze - I found this much easier for targetting my glutes than the classic glute bridge exercise and I can do it as often as I want throughout the day while on breaks at work.  \nDemo: http://bretcontreras.com/5-things-you-should-do-everyday/  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAb squeeze - If you can focus this contraction in a way that it is rotating your hips forward (think of pointing your crotch up to the sky) then you can more specifically target the muscles used to stabalise tilting. Again you can do this throughout the day. \nAb-rollers or planks can be added too but this one shouldn't be neglected.  \nDemo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDx1xfSobG4  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nQuad/Psoas stretch - I didn't think this did much at first but I do notice standing more confortably after it now. Turning it into a lunge will also help with hip mobility.  \nDemo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_hQSJVIN3c  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI have good hip mobility already which is why I have not included too much on it here. It can be an issue for people with a tilt so make sure to include hip flexor stretches if it applied to you.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Forward head**  \nWall stretches - This comes from neanderthall article but there are additional stretches I have found more effective in the video below (found in another post). I now do both as 1 routine.  \nDemo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTV6UCh-yhs and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ9-X5TUNjI  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Rounded shoulders**  \nYates row - I am currently running Phraks Greyskill LP (http://imgur.com/4zQdb) and the addition of rows has helped massively in balancing my previously push dominant routine. I do this with a supinated grip. Other types of rows are available but this one seems to work for me.  \nDemo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aETWa2h1Pko  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nScapula rotations - This came from my physio and works nicely to bring the shoulders out again. If you are lifting it is also just good sense to add some scapula work to prevent injury.  \nDemo w dumbbell: http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Infraspinatus/DBLyingExternalRotation.html  \nDemo w cable: http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Infraspinatus/CBStandingExternalRotation.html  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nFace pulls - Highlighted at T-Nation as a great exercise for posture correction. I do this after every workout using light weights/high reps. Keep it light and get the form right.  \nDemo: http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/you_should_be_doing_face_pulls  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor me these represent the best bang for buck exercises that have really helped. I'm no expert by any means but I hope this is a good starting point for some people looking to change.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLastly, more than anything else try to be aware of your posture throughout the day in all activities. It's fine to correct inbalances as above but if you keep up bad habbits this work is never ending.\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "My posture correction routine", "post_ups": 2488, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2sa62s/my_posture_correction_routine/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:13.604003", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "onthesunnyside", "post_created_utc": 1394492484.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1394581769.0, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2037n9", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 1505, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2486, "post_selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI'm sorry if I'm asking questions that are already covered in the FAQs, but I feel like the \"normal\" scenarios don't fit the situation of a morbidly obese person.\n\nI thought about using a throwaway for this, but I'm not going to.  I'm going to be completely honest.  \n\nI am morbidly obese.  Like, seriously morbidly obese.  I am the person that you look at and wonder \"how could she have let herself get that way?\"  Well, I got that way because losing weight is REALLY hard and I am addicted to food.  \n\nHere is my problem, and I hope you will take this seriously, because I am asking this in need of serious advice.  I would prefer advice from people who have been in my situation.  I am in pain a lot.  I have bad arthritis, especially in my knees and shoulders.  I've had x-rays showing bone spurs.  Moreso my back and neck hurt very, very badly whenever I try to walk.  My back begins to hurt within a minute of walking, or about five minutes of standing.  It gets worse and worse, and when I'm walking, the pain makes its way to my neck, as well.  It becomes nearly excruciating.  On top of that, I have athsma, which probably isn't surprising.\n\nToday I decided \"today is the day that I will start walking everyday\".  I walked less than 3/4 of a mile.  I wanted to die.  This sounds like nothing to you, I'm sure, but just the act of putting my sneakers on and lacing them to START walking was difficult.  Now, it's hours and hours later, and my neck and back still hurt.  I took 3 Aleve before I started walking, and 2 Tylenol about two hours later, and it's like I took nothing.\n\nMy big question, after all this typing, is...  how to you get through the pain?  I know that I need to stick at it, if I want the payoff, but it is so tempting to just stay on the couch when I know that it's going to hurt so bad that I will want to cry.\n\nSerious replies only.  This is hard enough for me already - once the fat-shaming begins, I will be deleting this post.  \n\nThanks.  \n\nEDIT:  Wow, thank you all SO much for the replies.  I am overwhelmed by the response, and the kind stranger who gave me gold.  You have given me so much to think about, and really makes me want to make some changes.  With the exception of the friendly fellow who sent me a message asking me to delete my post because this isn't /r/fatpeopleproblems, you've all been very kind!\n\nEDIT2:  I think I'm finally caught up on reading what was in my inbox.  I did my best to reply or upvote everyone who took the time to comment.

I was 6\u20193 and weighed around 130lbs at the start of my freshman year of college. I was a super active individual playing all sports mainly basketball, but never had picked a dumbbell in my 18 years. I then started paying attention to tracking my calories and was more self conscious about how I looked. It was a confidence thing, I never really cared for how big I was, I was just happy I was a 6ft male. \n\nInitial Macros goals at 130lbs \nCARBS: 342 G PER DAY.\nPROTEIN: 228 G PER DAY.\nFATS: 85 G PER DAY.\n\nThese were not reached everyday but I tried my best to get as close as possible using mass gainer. I ate anything I could get my hands on just to get in the habit of eating more.\n\nThe second semester of college I started going to the gym with a friend who was much bigger than me. He helped push me to achieve the goals I wanted, which was put on some type of weight. My initial lifts were:\n\n**Initial Component lifts**\n\n   **Bench - 55-65lbs for reps**\n   **Squat - 85lbs**\n   **Deadlift - 115lbs**\n\nAfter my freshman year I saw progress and I started wanting to lift more and gained around 12-15lbs. This weight of 145-150lbs was constant till about last year and my component lifts went up to:\n\n**Component lifts progress after a year**\n   **Bench - 145lbs**\n   **Squat - 135lbs**\n   **Deadlift - 165lbs**\n\nMy weight had gone up to around a constant weight of 155lbs which was a major jump, yet I still looked skinny since I was so tall. I then tore my ACL and went back down to 145/150 and lost all motivation last summer. However last November I decided to put my all into gaining muscle and getting bigger, along with rehab I went to the gym religiously and started giving it my all. I started taking mass gainer every morning and night after my workouts and made sure to eat around 3400 calories a day without the shake. Fast forward till today when I had the courage to post this photo to share my before and after of 4 years of lifting with constant breaks until this past year. My current PRs are:\n\n**Component Lifts today after 3.5yrs**\n   **Bench - 235lbs**\n   **Deadlifts - 385lbs**\n   **Squat - 215lbs (low due to ACL recovery)**\n\nThis is a transformation from 130lbs to weighing in at 176lbs today. No supplements other than mass gainer. I hope I motivate all the skinny guys out there. And I aim to get to 185lbs by next summer.\n\nMy initial lifts were the beginning push/pull/legs with sets of 4 going from 12-10-8-8 reps respectively.\n\nMy workout for the past year has been split into \nthe 5 days below with a 5x5 of the component workout for the respective day and then accessory lifts of 3 sets of 8-12reps.\n\nWorkout: \nMonday\n    1.Bench - 5x5 \n    2.

I have lurked on /r/fitness for long enough and it's time to share my weight loss journey.  First things first....\n\nBEFORE \nhttps://m.imgur.com/a/y7Csk\n\nAFTER   https://m.imgur.com/a/2f531\n\n\nWORK IDs (exactly 2 years apart) \n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/a/V74ki\n\n\nRE-CREATION PIC - http://imgur.com/L6e7qt1 \n\nThe last 1.5 years I have been putting in some serious work.  I've had weight problems since about 16 years old due to lack of exercise,  terrible diet and excessive drinking.  I usually floated around 235-250, highest I've seen was 262 on the scale. On Jan. 1, 2015 at 3am, I realized I needed to this change immediately.  \nI quit drinking altogether and haven't had one drink since.  This was insanely difficult but I'll save it for another post.  Didn't change anything except the drinking and dropped to 225 in 6 months.  After losing some weight and gaining some confidence, I looked to include some exercise in my life.  \n\nI started small, running (walking) one mile a day on the treadmill at the YMCA near my house.  My first mile was 18 minutes slow walking and I barely made it without stopping; it was embarrassing to myself to say the least.  I was an athlete growing up and couldn't believe I fell this far into a hole.  I slowly changed my diet and was estimating calories around 1800 a day. At the time I ate lean pockets with salad and carrots on top.  I had no idea what I was doing but knew it was better than the fast food, pizza, and beer I had been slamming in the past.\n\nI got down to 205 on the lean pocket noob diet but hit a road block for about a month.  My mile time had dropped to 12-13 minutes and I knew it was time to add more to my routine.  I got sick of the treadmill and picked a route near my house that took about one hour to run/walk.  I didn't even measure the mileage, just did this route every single day.  About 2 months later I decided to GPS the route and it was 6.6 miles.  Ended up run/walking 6.6 miles for 49 days straight, I missed only one day.  I would run as far as I could, then walk, then run ect. This broke my plateau and I finally broke 200 and got to the 190 range.  \n\nI graduated from the lean pocket bs and started eating chicken,quinoa and eggs like a mad man.  My farts were absolutely terrible and still are.  By now I was 1 year into this and felt pretty good but knew I had more in me.  I bought a mountain bike and went on 10-20 mile trail/road rides 3 times a week.  In between days I would walk/run my normal route.  Plateaued again around 180-185.\nFast forward a few months to today.  I am back on the treadmill and have a gym membership.  A couple days ago I ran my fastest mile at 6:15. I will break 6 minutes sometime this month.  I incorporated weight lifting into my routine for 40 min and finish it off with a 2 mile run(no walking this time) under 16 min.  My diet is now mostly chicken breast, quinoa, eggs, turkey sandwiches ,protein shakes, avocado ect (all the good shit).  I am currently trying to gain back some muscle I lost, aiming for 180lbs at 11-13 percent bf.\n\nThis has been an insane journey but the single best decision I have made in my life.  I literally feel like I am 16 again and am in the best shape of my life.  The positive occurrences in my life far outweigh the negatives, where not long ago this was flip flopped. STOKED!\n\nWell that's my story!  My hope is that someone reads this and makes that change in their life that they've always wanted. Thanks Reddit!\n\n\nNotes\n\n-I had 6 months off between contracts at work, this helped tremendously. \n\n-Consistancy is king\n\n-Lacking on before pics (around 230-245 in pics).  Can't find any of my heaviest because I hated taking pictures.\n\n-Forgot about disc golf, awesome hobby for excercise.  I would play speed rounds and almost run the course. Fun/cardio is better then cardio.\n\nEDIT:\n\nWell I just woke up and holy shit. RIP INBOX.  Imma sort thru this and find a red bow tie.  Thanks all, this is unbelievable.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nPicture has been recreated. I felt like the shag car from dumb and dumber with that mop on my head!

People who exercised [3-5x a week](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DkVjOxEVsAAocce.jpg) seemed to be feeling better than people who were outside that zone. Understanding these non-linear, U-shaped relationships might help us design better clinical trials one day!\n\n* the [type of exercise](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DkVj1SQUYAEbMYx.jpg) people did seems important too!

In this study, people were just asked how they were feeling. This might not be the end of the world. In general, most people have a reasonable understanding of their feelings, and in depressed or anxious patients self-report evaluations are highly correlated with clinician-rated evaluations. But we could be more precise in the future)\n\n \n* we don't know that exercising actually improves your mental health from these data!! all we know is that people who exercised had better mental health. We tried to be very clear about this! But there have also been [lots of studies](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DkVnvVBUUAE9o61.jpg) showing that exercise does causally improve mental health, especially depression. Madhukar Trivedi's group @UTSWNews showed that people who exercise and take antidepressants do better than people who just took the meds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Really interesting new study exploring the association between mental health and exercise across 1.2 million Americans", "post_ups": 2474, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/96o1bx/really_interesting_new_study_exploring_the/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:15.276369", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "FarleyToPitt", "post_created_utc": 1419357838.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1419365076.0, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2q70hb", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 420, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2464, "post_selftext": "Male, 24 Years Old, 6'1\", 103.8 pounds in 5 months.\n\n[Farley to Pitt](http://i.imgur.com/yveyFTg.jpg)\n\n[Profile Before](http://i.imgur.com/zzOTlxE.jpg)\n\n[Profile After](http://i.imgur.com/YY8HPyt.jpg)\n\n[Weight Before](http://i.imgur.com/T4ewQUc.jpg)\n\n[Weight After](http://i.imgur.com/wdQHTTE.jpg)\n\nAlright, /r/fitness, it's my time to do my part in what I see as \"giving back\" in this community which is to post my transformation. I know a lot of people don't like these posts and want them relegated to other subreddits, but I got my motivation from /r/fitness and transformation posts were huge for me so if this can motivate one guy/girl like me, then I'll have done my part. I saved this for this time of year, hoping it may motivate some people who are considering a change in 2015.\n\n**Quick Bio**\n\nTL:DR: Fatty tries and tries again, finally gets the prize.\n\nI've been overweight since the middle of high school and really ballooned during college. I've been firmly in the obese category for 5-6 years. I doubt anyone has tried and failed as many diets as I have in that time span. I have archives upon archives of \"before\" pictures. But my struggle can be summed up with the Thomas Edison quote (I know all the Tesla/Edison stuff-I'm only supporting a theory behind a quote, not a man): when asked how he felt about his 1,000 failed attempts to create the light bulb, Edison reportedly replied \"I haven't failed 1,000 times, I've found 1,000 ways NOT to make a light bulb\". Whether this is a true story or not, the mentality behind it is true. If you've tried time and time again, you have not failed-you have learned ways that don't work for you. Change something, anything, and try again. You only have to get it right once to change your life. I'd like to say I saw what I had become, had a moment of clarity where the sun shined down on me and I changed then and there, but the truth is, that had happened many times and it always wore off. It is the continued daily effort that gets the job done-not the sudden surge of inspiration or motivation.\n\n**Quick Breakdown of My Transformation**\n\nTL:DR: Caloric deficit every single day for 5 months straight, typical day < 1,500 calories + 1 hour exercise. 103.8 pounds in 5 months.\n\nFor the past 5-6 years, my goal has been to get under 200 pounds. On 06/01/2014, I stepped on the scale right at midnight and looked down to see that I weighed the most I've ever weighed in my life: [295.6 pounds](http://i.imgur.com/T4ewQUc.jpg). For 5 months, I focused on being as healthy as I could while taking in less than 1,500 calories per day, and exercising for 1 hour each day. On the morning of 11/01/2014 I stepped back on the same scale and looked down to see that I weighed the least I've ever weighed while 6 feet tall: [191.8 pounds](http://i.imgur.com/wdQHTTE.jpg). \n\n**The TL:DR of my advice**\n\n1. Study and research as much as you can about your goal and how to achieve it. Learn the nutrition, the exercises, the pros and cons of everything. Knowing your stuff is how you avoid putting tons of effort into activities that won't give the results that you're looking for.\n\n2. Study and research yourself. Nutrition and fitness are evolving sciences-we don't know everything about how our bodies work yet (but we know a heck of a lot-see # 1). On top of that, everyone is different to some degree. It may be easier for you to have a cheat day to keep you from breaking down or you may be like me and a cheat day may be counterproductive because it opens you to temptations that are hard to pull back from at the end of it.\n\n3. The ONLY correct diet for weight loss is the one that you stick to. I've lost 15 pounds in 2 weeks, before going back to my old ways more times than I can count. It doesn't matter how great a diet works if you can't stick to it for long enough to reach your goal. \n\nI'm embarrassed to admit I used to see these posts and I was too lazy to read some giant explanation of all kinds of stuff about the lifestyle, life, etc. so I'm intentionally going to break this up into parts. I hope this isn't seen as karma whoring. I obviously couldn't care less about internet points on an alternate account I made specifically for this post. For /r/fitness, I'll obviously break down my workout. I've posted my diet and nutritional goals and mission in my /r/loseit post [(link here)](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/2q73l1/male_24_years_old_61_295_to_191_lbs_in_5_months/) and I encourage you to check that out because it is very detailed and took a long time to come up with the diet to meet the needs I wanted to meet.\n\nSince my goal was burning fat, I did not get super detailed into specific workouts and exercises. My goal in my workouts for the majority of the transformation was simply to burn calories. For the first month or so I walked. If that's all you can do-don't be ashamed! Go Walk! Walking, and especially power walking, is in my opinion one of the most undervalued things by obese people. They feel like they can't exercise (which is often true in terms of intense workouts) so they don't. You'd be surprised how many calories walking/power walking can burn! Start by walking for your hour of exercise. Then find a way to run for 5 minutes in that hour, then 10 minutes, then 15. I literally started by strolling on a treadmill for an hour and by the end of the 5 months, I was running 5 miles during my hour of exercise.\n\nAbout halfway through my transformation I realized I'd want some sort of body once all this fat fell off, plus I wanted to get my body conditioned for working out so I could make the body I wanted after getting rid of what I didn't want, so I added basic, general workouts. By the end, my routine consisted of 30 minutes of workout including pull ups, pushups, situps, [dumbbell flyes](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/dumbbell-flyes) and curls, then 30 minutes of running. My routine was 30 mins workout, 30 mins run one day, then run the full hour the next day. And repeat. Again-it is important to clearly identify your goal and the best way to achieve it and my goal was fat burning. \n\nI just want to urge you, if you are not who you want to be-it is time, right now to go do it! I intentionally made this post a week before the 1st of the year so you have no excuse-go shopping today, go shopping this weekend, get your routine together-you have 7 days and then you begin, no matter what! People don't plan to fail-they fail to plan!\n\nIf you ARE who you want to be, if you're knowledgeable about fitness and what it takes, especially if you got that way in part from /r/fitness, stick around the community, help the new guys/girls-explain things, be kind and welcoming. This community was so instrumental in educating and motivating me to become this new person-please keep that up.\n\nIn closing, thank you /r/fitness for the new me. Please continue to be the community you were for me for others down the road.\n\nQuestions HIGHLY encouraged!", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Male, 24 Years Old, 6'1\", 295 to 191 lbs in 5 Months", "post_ups": 2464, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2q70hb/male_24_years_old_61_295_to_191_lbs_in_5_months/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:15.276369", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "brybell", "post_created_utc": 1524528630.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1524528869.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "8eg8k0", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 117, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2464, "post_selftext": "I am just really excited and pretty proud of myself I was able to accomplish something I set my mind to. I can't really remember too many times in my life that I have actually felt proud of myself.\n\nI'm 29/m. Back in January I came here looking for a workout plan to start lifting with the goal of gaining strength. I started with the Phrak's GSLP plan and I did that for three months. I was weak, very weak, especially for my size. I am 6'4 and was close to 300lbs when I started. \n\nFor example I started benching 95lbs. My chest has always been weak. I just started doing 5/3/1 for beginners, and right now I am repping 175lbs. I know it's still not a lot, but the progress I have made in a fairly short amount of time has amazed me.\n\nAlong with lifting I was doing cardio in the form of the stationary bike, but was getting bored so I started running. After a close friend ran a 10K, it inspired me to pick a run and start training for that, so I found a 10K in SF and started running.\n\nI used the 4-week to 10k program [https://www.verywellfit.com/4-week-beginner-10k-training-schedule-2910828]. Even with getting a pretty bad sinus infection last weekend, I was able to run the race yesterday and I achieved my goal of running the entire thing without walking. My time was 1:16:57.\n\nI am down to about 280lbs now, not a huge loss, but I have definitely lost more inches. I think with the lifting I replaced a lot of fat with muscle.\n\nI am very thankful of the sub, if you put your mind to something you can accomplish anything. I've always been overweight and fairly sedentary besides a year or so in college where I was going to the gym. I am thrilled to start this new healthy lifestyle with my wife.\n\nThanks /r/fitness.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "I just ran my first 10K and have been lifting since January thanks to this sub", "post_ups": 2464, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8eg8k0/i_just_ran_my_first_10k_and_have_been_lifting/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:15.276369", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Chewbaccas_Bowcaster", "post_created_utc": 1424714491.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2ww4wy", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 921, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2464, "post_selftext": "Happy Monday, new video from Dom\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7GJWM91ecc", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Broscience: Anatomy of the Modern Lifting Bro", "post_ups": 2464, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2ww4wy/broscience_anatomy_of_the_modern_lifting_bro/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:15.276369", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Startfresh12345", "post_created_utc": 1391660557.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "1x5hf8", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 451, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2467, "post_selftext": "I have laughed at some stories I have seen on here over the years, and thought, hey, why not share my own.\n\nThis happened today.

The most difficult part of the process was the recovery from the procedure. This is a picture of me [before](http://i.imgur.com/XSjWpJD.png) and [after](https://i.imgur.com/XLGMNYs.jpg) surgery.\n* In the post surgery picture you\u2019ll notice tubes leading to a bulb. This is a [surgical drain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drain_(surgery)) this was incredibly disturbing to me.\n* I got the drain removed after about three weeks but the swelling didn\u2019t subside for about a month and a half. This swelling looked like stomach fat to the untrained eye(myself included) and caused a great deal of stress in my life. After All, I had spent the last 3+ years dieting to get rid of this fat and now it looked like it was back and I was bed bound.\n* In my last post I didn\u2019t show any pictures of my loose skin because I was ashamed of it. \nHere is a picture of a relatively [lean me with my flap of loose skin](http://i.imgur.com/mIFxjAB.png)\n\n**The recovery from this surgery got dark man**\n\n* The inability to exercise affected me much more dramatically than I had anticipated. I became deeply depressed and was consumed with feelings of hopelessness. I thought with certainty that I had lost all progress made in the gym and through my diet.\n* Without the support I received from r/Fitness, private messages, encouraging comments etc. I might have taken a darker path than the one I took. So again, thank you guys.\n\n**Competing in Men\u2019s Physique**\n\n* When I was recovered enough to get back in the gym, I decided I needed a solid goal to dedicate my time and energy towards and having gotten my excess skin removed I could finally take my shirt off in front of people. I registered for a bodybuilding competition to compete in Men\u2019s Physique.\n* I hired my coach midway through June with the competition on Oct. 4, 2014. This gave me about 16 weeks to prep for the event, which I\u2019ve heard is a reasonable amount of time for a natural competitor.\n* Having only started training with purpose in Sept. 2013, I knew this was an ambitious goal but one which I still feel is achievable.\n\n\n\n\n**Contest prep**\n\n**The diet**\n\n* My coach is an old school bodybuilder who believes very strongly in bro tactics such as small meals every two hours and morning cardio. I personally have found great success with flexible dieting(counting macros). For this experience though, I decided to put aside my own notions and give myself fully to the program prescribed.\n* I\u2019m eating six small meals of primarily tilapia and brown rice. I have egg yolks in my first meal for fat content and a cup of green veggies with all six meals. Being that this is a meal plan, knowing the macros doesn\u2019t do anything for me but since I\u2019m so macro-conscious I figured them out. The macros come out to 45 fat, 145 carb and 225 protein. \n\nFor those curious, here is my exact meal plan:\n\n- Meal one: 4 egg yolks, 2 egg whites, \u00bd cup(40g dry) oats, 1 cup(85g) fibrous veggies(green beans, broccoli, spinach)\n- Meal two: 6oz tilapia, \u00bd cup oats or \u2154 cup(120g cooked) brown rice, 1 cup fibrous veggies\n- Meal three: 6oz tilapia, \u00bd cup oats or \u2154 cup brown rice, 1 cup fibrous veggies\n- Meal four: 6oz tilapia, \u00bd cup oats or \u2154 cup brown rice, 1 cup fibrous veggies\n- Meal five: 6oz tilapia, 1 cup fibrous veggies\n- Meal six: 6 egg whites\n\n**The training & cardio**\n\n- My coach has me doing six days on, one day off. These days are split up into arms/push/pull/legs/push/pull. We are doing weak-point training with an emphasis on arms and chest. Both of my push days begin with a chest movement and end with a shoulder movement. I am working biceps and triceps on my arm day and again lightly on the second day of it's complimentary movement eg. push: triceps, pull: biceps.\n- I'm doing three days of moderate intensity steady-state cardio for 45min(walking hilly roads) and two days of 20min HIIT sessions. The introduction of cardio brought with it substantial weight loss that has since slowed down. Before we began this prep I was doing little to no cardio.\n\n**The results**\n\n- The most impressive part of this show prep for me is the constant progress. Dieting on my own program I will sometimes stop seeing progress and then attribute the lack of progress to something outside of my control. With another person handling my diet and training, we have a more objective look and thus we break through any plateau very quickly.\n- I started this cut hovering right below 180lbs. In this picture, I had already begun the diet two weeks prior. [Here I am 175lbs] (http://i.imgur.com/OSxwa6n.jpg)\n- In the last picture (175lbs) I was roughly 10% body fat according to caliper testing. I was pretty lean already. [This is me at 165lbs(6% bodyfat) after five more weeks of dieting] (http://i.imgur.com/34KiTFB.jpg).\n- Only two weeks have passed since the last image(165lb). [Here I am today at 162lb] (http://i.imgur.com/D15qGfC.jpg).\n\nSelfies:\n[Front](http://i.imgur.com/Awuki1y.jpg) and [Back](http://i.imgur.com/BDYthv8.jpg).\n\nBonus: [picture of my scar](http://i.imgur.com/QGRudO6.jpg)\n\n\n\n**Routine and lifts**\n\n- The combination of taking time off to recover from surgery and then going into a cut has taken a toll on my strength. I\u2019m not focused too much on moving these numbers at the moment. Per my coaches instructions: I am exercising my muscles, not annihilating them. This strategy is becoming more important as I get leaner and lower calorie in order to reduce risk of injury.\n\n[My current routine as prescribed by my coach](http://i.imgur.com/RETZq1B.png)\n\nMy numbers:\n\nSquat: 295lb 1-3 rep max\n\nBench: 225lb 1 rep max\n\nDead: 365lb (unwilling to test max)\n\nOHP: 135lb 1 rep max\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n**I\u2019m still clean and sober and I\u2019m still stupid happy :-)**. The things I\u2019ve achieved in this journey, freedom from obesity and drug addiction, have shown me that I am capable of great things. The only thing ever holding me back is me. When I allow myself to live in fear of the unknown I become paralyzed. The hardest part is just getting started, after that the rest is easy. Dedicating my life to health and wellness is what I needed to recover from obesity and drug/alcohol dependence. By no means am I fully recovered. Everyday I struggle with urges to binge on unhealthy foods or ingest illicit substances. The difference is, now I\u2019m able to recognize that all those things, whether cupcakes or vodka, are just an attempt by myself to change the way I feel using something outside of me. The happiness I\u2019ve found has all come from things I\u2019ve done for myself, not to myself.\n\n\n\nThanks again for this r/Fitness\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n**Details and continuation:**\n\nMy competition is the [2014 Iron Man Naturally](http://i.imgur.com/8xgnev7.jpg) and is held just north of Seattle, Washington in Bothell, Washington.\n\n\nMy name is Ed Hones and I will be competing in Men\u2019s Physique: Division A\n\n\nIf any redditors are going to be in the Seattle area on October 4, 2014, come support me at the Iron Man and join me and my friends for a cheatmeal after the show.

Carbs usually hit about 80-100g/day, and they vary between oats, sweet potatoes, brown rice and rice cakes. Additionally, keeping my fat between 20-30g/day, sometimes less. (God bless buff bake peanut butter protein!!)\n\nI think it's important to say though, that my diet is strict, and I haven't varied AT ALL from it, and I am also doing a large amount of high intensity cardio, both of which play a role in my muscle exposure.\n\nAdditional pictures:\n\n* [Front progress](http://i.imgur.com/bRf4grC.jpg)\n* [One pose](http://i.imgur.com/CT8aOVX.jpg)\n* [One more pose, for fun](http://i.imgur.com/sp8eV5V.jpg)", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Back Progress 27 y/o Female, training for first bikini competition", "post_ups": 2448, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3ouq1l/back_progress_27_yo_female_training_for_first/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:15.276369", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "tunnelingdistress", "post_created_utc": 1418581528.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1418616714.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2pa0wk", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 520, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2443, "post_selftext": "Take a before picture.

Weight maintenance was defined as\nweight maintained within \u00b15% of baseline body mass index (BMI). We examined the role of various sociodemographic and lifestyle factors in successful weight maintenance.\n>\n> **Results:** Relatively few young adults were able to maintain their weight over ten years (28.6% of women vs. 23.0% of men); net weight loss was uncommon (7.5% and 3.8%). Most participants gained weight (mean annual weight gain was 0.9 kg in women and 1.0 kg in men). Among women, exercise was associated with successful weight maintenance, but having two or more children, frequent use of sweet drinks, irregular eating, history of dieting (intentional weight loss) and low life satisfaction were associated with weight gain. Among men, higher baseline BMI and higher education were associated with successful weight maintenance, whereas irregular eating, history of dieting and smoking were associated with weight gain.\n> \n> **Conclusions:** Only about a quarter of young adults were able to resist weight gain. Regular eating and having no history of dieting were associated with successful weight maintenance in young women and men\n\nQuite an interesting study, though there are some methodological issues (~30% attrition rate, significant differences at follow up, self reporting questionnaires, diet and confounding factors like smoking weren't assessed at follow up to see how they changed) and the authors do state that average BMI is higher in Finland than elsewhere, and quite a lot of participants were overweight/obese at baseline. \n\nI don't think their findings are particularly surprising, the two factors associated with weight gain in both men and women were irregular eating and a history of dieting. A history of dieting I can understand - probably reflects how people have difficulty controlling their intake and their disposition towards weight gain. Irregular eating is a bit more intriguing to me, so if anyone has more info on its association with weight gain it'd be helpful.\n\nExercise was only significantly associated with weight maintenance in women, the association was non-significant but still positive in men. I recall other studies have shown that it's diet, rather than exercise, that contributes primarily to someones weight but it is nice to see that exercise does have its role in maintaining body weight.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Finnish study shows only 25% of young adults maintain their bodyweight over 10 years", "post_ups": 2438, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/888nf4/finnish_study_shows_only_25_of_young_adults/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:15.276369", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Les-Daniels", "post_created_utc": 1535029202.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1535048078.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "99n61n", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 106, "post_num_crossposts": 1, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2436, "post_selftext": "Used this site a lot last year, I added it to my favourites but since I have a new computer it's gone and for some reason it's nowhere to be found.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nEdit : [ExRx.net](https://ExRx.net)!!  exrx.net/Lists/WorkoutMenu is a little more specific :) !!!!  \n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Looking for a site where you can create your own work-outs, the site recommends what muscle group you should train but also shows the different exercises for each muscle.

I make sure to hit my protein goal. Anywhere from 150-200 grams a day, my fat goal of 60-75  grams a day, and the rest I fill with carbs. I eat mostly lean meat like Chicken, Turkey and Fish. Rice and pasta are essential as well, especially for pre workout. I don't take any supplements besides whey protein and multivitamins. When I was losing weight I was eating around 1800 calories a day. I'm currently eating 3200 calories a day as I'm trying to bulk up to around 185 in the next couple of years.\n\nMy workout routine consists of 6 days a week for about 1-1.5 hours each day. I do 3 free weight days and 3 bodyweight days every week, with Sunday being my off day. \n\nI'm not currently following a specific plan, I'm just working on on the body parts I think need the most work, and it's been working great so far! My weight days consist of Squats at 5\u00d73, RDL'S for 8\u00d73, Leg Press for 8\u00d73, Bench and Rows for 5\u00d75, Curls and Extensions for 8\u00d75 and Shrugs, Chest Flys and Lat pulldowns for 8\u00d75. I then finish off with planks for as long as I can before I finish (Current best time is 3 minutes and 53 seconds) I rest 90 seconds in between each set, and 2 minutes in between each exercise.\n\nAs for my bodyweight days. I do push ups and pullups for 15\u00d75, lunges for 8\u00d75, Dips and Cable curls for 10\u00d75, Knee raises and sit ups for 20\u00d75, and again I finish with planks at the end. I rest 60 seconds in between each set and 90 seconds in between each exercise.\n\nIt all started roughly 4 years ago. I was 260 pounds, and in easily the worst shape of my life. I couldn't even climb the stairs at home without winding myself. I woke up one day and caught a glimpse of myself in the bathroom mirror (I sleep in my underwear) and let's just say I was simultaneously disgusted and disappointed in myself. I let things go way too far, and came up with every excuse along the way. I knew that moment that I had to change, and I wanted too more than anything.\n\nThe very next day I woke up early, put some old sweat pants on and went for a short walk. Baby steps they say, but I felt wonderful afterwards. I went completely cold turkey. I immediately started eating healthy and watching my calorie intake, and the weight started melting off. I was so proud. I remember the first 10 lbs, and the 10 after that. Each time I weighed myself and saw that the number was lower, it motivated me even more. I finally felt like I was accomplishing something with my life, and that alone made it all worth it. \n\nFast forward to today, and I've never been in better shape. I'm now working out 6-7 days a week, and lifting almost every day. I'm now 170 pounds, but my body fat % is as low as its ever been, and I have more muscle than I ever have as well. I look like a completely different person, but better in every way. Not only physically, but mentally I've never been happier. The weight loss and lifting has helped me more than I could have ever dreamed with my Depression and OCD. My bad weeks turned into bad days, which turned into bad hours. My OCD is almost completely under control, and all without the use of medication. I honestly could not have imagined waking up with a smile on my face as opposed to not wanting to even get out of bed.\n\nIt all started that one morning. I had an epiphany, and I'm so proud of myself and how far I've come since then. I cut the shit, got realistic, and started eating right, eating less and moving more, and shockingly, IT WORKED! I know, unbelievable, but eating less and moving more actually gets you results! If you got this far, and are still reading, I appreciate it! I also hope that if you're going through what I am, or want to change, that you need to be honest with yourself and work hard most of all. You can and will succeed, and I truly believe that. Stay focused, and remember that one bad day doesn't ruin everything. As long as you don't let that day turn into a week, or a month or a year etc...

Coleman.\n\nAnyway, there seems to be a bit of a conflict between conventional training wisdom for beginners (3 day a week full body linear progression! SS/SL/Greyskull only!) and what beginners actually wanna do (in the gym every day, biceps and triceps, woo!). What I'm going to write here is an attempt to reconcile these two ideas and produce a sane way for a beginner to train more frequently and give the attention to the glamour muscles that they want, while also progressing in a correct, appropriate manner. To do this, I'm going to borrow wisdom from a few different programs and ideas. My goal is to provide an accessible program for beginners with enough volume to stimulate growth in the bro muscles, while also giving enough intensity in the main movements to elicit strength adaptations.\n\n\n\n**First, some nomenclature:**\n\n3x10 - in this case, it reads *three sets of ten repetitions*\n\n2x5, 1x5+  - this reads as, *two sets of 5, one set of at least 5, but as many as possible* (more to come on this later)\n\n\nSS - this reads as *superset* (two exercises performed back to back with no rest in between. **SUPASET**)\n\nBB - *barbell*\n\nDB - *dumbbell*\n\n**WOAH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ACCESSORY WORK AND MAIN LIFTS?**\n\nThe main lifts are just the first exercises of the day, and these are always going to be done heavier than the other lifts of that day. The lifts that follow are accessory lifts, designed to build muscle, balance out weakpoints and improve your strength in the main lifts.\n\n**BUT I DON'T CARE ABOUT STRENGTH, I JUST WANNA BE JACKED AND TAN**\n\nWho doesn't wanna be jacked and tan, I mean honestly? But strength progression is important, especially as a novice, for making you more muscular. Generally speaking, the more you can lift, the bigger you'll be. Progressing your main lifts will also have carryover effects to your other lifts as well: if you can bench press 300lbs, you can sure as hell bet that you're not gonna be incline dumbbell pressing 20lbs. And who do you really think is gonna be bigger: the version of you who can bench 200lbs, or the version of you who can bench 300lbs?\n\n**WHAT IS LINEAR PROGRESSION?**\n\nPut simply, linear progression means that if you were to graph your weights, the line that you would end up drawing would be straight. [Like this](http://i.imgur.com/yX67l03.png). This means that you need to add weight workout to workout, every workout. You can make progress very quickly this way *if you're a beginner* because your body doesn't need much stimulus to adapt. As you get more advanced, you need more stimulus and more time to adapt. [See this handy graph from Starting Strength to get a better understanding of what I mean.](http://startingstrength.com/articles/figure1te.jpg)\n\n**WHAT IS PPL?**\n\nPPL is just the initialiasm of *push, pull, legs* or *pull, push, legs* (it really doesn't matter which). This will (typically) have you doing 3 workouts, 2 times per week. \n\n* **Push** - this can just be thought of as moving things *away* from your body (think of a bench press)\n\n* **Pull** - this can be thought of as moving things *towards* your body (think of a row)\n\n* **Legs** - I'm not going to bother with an explanation here\n\n**WHY DO I NEED TO PROGRESS LIKE THIS?**\n\n[Because of progressive overload](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_overload). Without this, you won't make any adaptations (strength gains or size gains).\n\nYou will always start the day with a heavy barbell exercise, and this is what you need to progress linearly (if you remember from above, this means add weight every session). Then afterwards you will follow up with higher repetition exercises, that are more 'bodybuilding' based. \n\n**WHAT IS THE PROGRAM?**\n\nIt's 6 days a week. You can run it one of two ways: **PPLRPPL** or **PPLPPLR** (where R denotes a rest day) depending on your schedule and preferences: it really makes no difference. Personally, I would run the program in the Pull, Push, Legs order.\n\n**YOU SAY TO ADD WEIGHT LINEARLY, BUT HOW MUCH WEIGHT DO YOU ADD PER SESSION?**\n\n* 2.5kg/5lbs for upper body lifts (bench press, row, overhead press)\n\n* 2.5kg/5lbs for squats\n\n* 5kg/10lbs for deadlifts\n\nNow, without further ado...\n\n**PULL**\n\nDeadlifts 1x5+/Barbell rows 4x5, 1x5+ (alternate, so if you did deadlifts on Monday, you would do rows on Thursday, and so on)\n\n3x8-12 Pulldowns OR Pullups OR chinups\n\n3x8-12 seated cable rows OR chest supported rows\n\n5x15-20 face pulls\n\n4x8-12 hammer curls\n\n4x8-12 dumbbell curls\n\n**PUSH**\n\n\n4x5, 1x5+ bench press/4x5, 1x5+ overhead press (alternate in the same fashion as the rows and deadlifts)\n\n3x8-12 overhead press/3x8-12 bench press (do the opposite movement: if you bench pressed first, overhead press here)\n\n3x8-12 incline dumbbell press\n\n3x8-12 triceps pushdowns SS 3x15-20 lateral raises\n\n3x8-12 overhead triceps extensions SS 3x15-20 lateral raises\n\n**LEGS**\n\n2x5, 1x5+ squat\n\n3x8-12 Romanian Deadlift\n\n3x8-12 leg press\n\n3x8-12 leg curls\n\n5x8-12 calf raises\n\n\n\n\n\n**FINER DETAILS: AMRAP SETS AND PROGRESSION OF ACCESSORIES**\n\nSo, the first movements are done for sets of 5, and the final set is what's known as an *AMRAP* set (As Many Reps As Possible). This doesn't mean that you can just YOLO it and push until you can't push anymore. By As Many Reps As Possible, it really means *As many reps as possible while still maintaining good form*. You don't really want to be grinding too many reps, since you want to keep rep quality high. If you want a good reason to keep rep quality high, [watch this recent video from Omar Isuf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLSpdzT6sGw). The point of the AMRAP set is that it really gives you a chance to test your limits, and if you're feeling good on a specific day, you can get in a couple of extra reps. But the real moneymaker from this comes in when you deload.\n\n**Progression of accessories** should be done as so: when you can hit 3 sets of 12 with good form, add weight. As long as you're in the 8-12 range for your sets then you're good. If not, lower the weight.\n\n**HOW DO I KNOW WHAT WEIGHTS TO START WITH?**\n\nI don't like the Stronglifts 5x5 idea of starting with the empty bar, because I think the empty bar is useless for training purposes if you're capable of lifting a lot more. The mechanics of a lift (especially the squat for me) change a lot with weight. \n\nI would recommend starting with the bar, and gradually adding weight for sets of 5 until the bar slows down. Then back off 2.5kg/5lbs, and this is your starting point. So if you worked up to a 60kg bench press before the bar slowed down at all, start at 57.5kg. \n\n\n**WARMUPS**\n\n(idea courtesy of /u/Gawd1)\n\nI'm a big believer in just practising the movement as a warmup. So you can use bench press to warm up for bench press. Or squats to warm up for squats. You get the idea. The goal of a warmup is to get blood into the muscles and joints that are going to be used, and also to start drilling the motor patterns into your body for form purposes. As an example, if you're going to be benching 200lbs as your top set for that day, your warmups could look something like this:\n\nEmpty bar x 10\n\n95lbs x10\n\n135lbs x5\n\n185lbs x3\n\n200lbs 4x5, 1x5+\n\nWarming up is a very individual thing, however, so do whatever you want to get yourself prepared for the lifts. If you like foam rolling, great. If you like some dynamic stretches and things like clapping pushups, great. Do whatever you want to do. The only recommendation is that I would avoid static stretches before lifting. \n\n**REST**\n\nRest as long as is needed between sets. For a general guideline, I would recommend:\n\n* 3-5 minutes between your first exercise of the day\n\n* 1-3 minutes between all your other exercises\n\nDon't worry too much about rest times, and worry more about just getting all your sets and reps in.\n\n**FAILURE**\n\nFailure is part of life, and since lifting weights is a lot like life, failure is also part of lifting weights. At some point, you're going to fail. Failure can occur really for two reasons\n\n* not enough sleep, food or recovery: if you spent all night partying and chasing pussy with your wing man, Jim Beam, you're probably not gonna perform well in the gym. In this case, don't count it as a true failure and just try again next time when you're fresh\n\n* strength failure. This is when you've reached the limit of your progression. If you fail a session 3 times in a row (for example, if you fail to hit 3x5 on squats at 100kg 3 times in a row), you need to lower the weight.\n\nThis leads us to...\n\n**DELOADING**\n\nDeloading is exactly what it sounds like -- taking weight off the bar. Take 10% off your working weights (so a 100kg squat would go back down to 90kg), and work back up. This should give you a good chance to push things on the AMRAP final sets. If you got 2x5 and 1x6 at 90kg the first time round, you can bet your ass that you'll get more than 6 on your last set the second time round. And by the time you work your way back up, if you can hit 97.5kg for 2x5, 1x8, 100kg for 3x5 will be trivial.\n\n\n**MY GYM OR GARAGE DOESN'T HAVE XYZ, WHAT CAN I DO INSTEAD?**\n\n(this section as recommended by /u/LaRivalita)\n\nSo basically everything here is interchangeable, except the main lifts: the squat, bench press, deadlift, overhead press, bent over row. If you can do those in your gym (not in a smith machine) then you can make this program work. Treat it more as template than gospel. Some ideas for substitutions are the following (and if anyone has other suggestions, I'm happy to add them to the list!):\n\n* **Pull substitutions**\n\n* Seated cable rows can be replaced with dumbbell rows or t-bar rows\n\n* Face pulls can be replaced with rear delt flyes AND band pull aparts (not one or the other)\n\n* hammer curls and dumbbell curls can really be replaced by any curl variation: it's a curl, shit ain't that serious!\n\n* **Push substitutions**\n\n* incline dumbbell press can be replaced with landmine press\n\n* triceps pushdowns and overhead extensions can be replaced with any general triceps exercise: skullcrushers, lying triceps extensions, dumbbell triceps extensions, whatever you want to do\n\n* **Legs substitutions**\n\n* Leg press can be substituted with front squats \n\n* leg curls can be substituted with glute ham raises\n\n* calf raises can be substituted by nothing because who gives a flying fuck about calves anyway? (not srs, any kind of calf raise will be fine here)\n\n**HOW TO MODIFY THIS TO FIT YOUR GOALS**\n\n(this section as recommended by /u/theedoor)\n\n**If you want to lift heavy weights**\n\nThere are a few things I would recommend here. \n\n/u/theedoor's advice of: \"for example, if you want to be focused a bit more on strength, replace 3x8-12 RDLs with 3x5 RDLs. Add weighted dips, and weighted chins-ups/pull-ups in the 3x5 range (with bodyweight back off sets).\" is brilliant.\n\nIf you want to lift heavy weights, then you need to lift heavy weights. I know this sounds stupid, but it makes sense. The more time you spend in the lower rep ranges, the better you're going to be in those rep ranges, so if you want to lift heavy weights then feel free to alter the compound movement accessories (so your presses, your pulldowns or rows, your romanian deadlifts or your leg presses) to be in the lower rep ranges. 3x4-6 is perfect for things like this. In my view, the isolation accessory movements should be kept in higher rep ranges, because joint wear and tear can creep in here, and getting a pump is fucking awesome.\n\nSpecificity is also pretty key if you want to lift heavy weights. If you want to be a good bench presser, then maybe incline dumbbell press isn't going to be *as specific* as doing a close grip bench press instead is. If you want to substitute some of the (again, compound) accessory movements for ones that more closely resemble the main lifts, then be my guest. \n\n**If you want to increase endurance**\n\nKeep the first exercise the same, up the rep range on everything else. 15-20 reps is a great range for increasing endurance.\n\n**If you just want to be jacked and tan**\n\nKeep things the way they are. There's enough volume and a decent enough mix of volume and strength to get you big as long as you're eating enough. If you feel a specific bodypart is lacking, throw in a couple of extra sets for it, ideally isolation (so think along the lines of pec deck or biceps curls, not bench press or rows), so that you're not adding too much systemic stress, which could affect recovery times.\n\n**WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT, FORM OR WEIGHT?**\n\n(idea courtesy of /u/Nobody773)\n\nBoth. Nobody got big benching 1 plate regardless of how good their form is. You should push the weights up and continue progressing as long as your form is *acceptable.* Demanding that your form is 100% perfect all the time as a beginner is just not possible, so as long as your form is acceptable and not injurious, then continue adding weight. As an unknown lifter once said: the best way to improve your form at 225lbs is to make 225lbs part of your warmup. I can guarantee that when you're squatting 315lbs for reps that your form at 225lbs is picture perfect.\n\n**THIS IS COMPLICATED, THERE'S A LOT GOING ON! HOW DO I KEEP TRACK OF THIS?**\n\nIt's something I hadn't thought of, since I have a borderline-autistic savant memory for things I do in the gym, but [here is spreadsheet created by /u/Mobius000](https://drive.google.com/previewtemplate?id=1MbOWpTBcNNQuqHd8q9jUUR2V-ZERWNDKYPd5kzVjCJQ&mode=public) which will make tracking this a walk in the park. \n\n**CAN I DO THIS PROGRAM WHILE CUTTING?**\n\nSure! You can do anything while cutting, so try it out. I suspect that recovery may become an issue due to the volume, so if you are struggling to recover and feeling like shit, drop some of the volume: 3x8-12 becomes 2x8-12, for example. Taper the volume off as little as possible, and keep the volume for the main lifts as high as you can for as long as you can.\n\n**CAN I DO AB WORK ON THIS PROGRAM?**\n\nYes. I would recommend doing ab work on your deadlift days and your squat days if you want to do ab work. Nothing major, just do a few sets of (weighted) planks or a few sets of ab wheel and some hanging leg raises.\n\n**NEXT STEPS**\n\nA few people have requested this, so I thought I would write out what I think logical next steps from here are. This is a **beginner** routine, for beginners. Intermediate and advanced lifters can't make linear progress like this anymore, and require some more advanced training in order to progress. \n\n\nQuestions courtesy of /u/FattestRabbit:\n\n>**What are some signs that you may want to graduate from this program?**\n\nPut simply, when you're no longer a beginner. A beginner lifter is defined as someone who can make progress workout to workout: if you deadlift 100kg for 5 reps, then the next time you deadlift you'll be able to deadlift 105kg for 5 reps. Once this *linear* progression stalls out, and you take longer to recover between workouts because the weights are heavier (and therefore the systemic stress is higher), you become an intermediate lifter. An intermediate lifter is someone who needs ~weekly progression in order to maintain progress (programs like the Texas Method for example).\n\n>**Can you adapt this program for 'intermediate' lifters? How far can this program take you if you upped the weights and moved more sets to 3x5-8 (instead of 3x8-12)?**\n\nYes, you can adapt this program for more intermediate lifters, but I wouldn't like to try and formalise something like that. The more advanced you get as a lifter, the more you should be realising what things are beneficial for you, and figuring out what works for you, because everyone is a bit different. In the beginner stages, this stuff really isn't too important because almost any beginner will make progress doing almost anything. I would recommend looking at progression schemes that are in things like the **Texas Method**, **Madcows 5x5** and **5/3/1** for your main lifts and then just sticking with fairly similar accessory work: more volume almost always equates to better gains, provided you can recover from it.\n\nMoving more sets to 3x5-8 wouldn't necessarily have a huge impact on your abilities to lift big weights in the main lifts, and heavier sets (in my experience) tend to impose more wear and tear on the joints. If you're an intermediate lifter then go for it, try it out, it may work for you. Intermediate lifting should be all about trying things for yourself and getting to know yourself better as a lifter.\n\n>**What are some next logical programs to try after this one?**\n\nTexas Method, Madcows 5x5, 5/3/1, PHAT, PHUL, /u/gzcl's Jacked and Tan - any program designed towards intermediates that are in line with your goals. Pick something you think you'll have fun with: unless this shit is your job or you really want to compete seriously then just have fun in the gym and don't do something too retarded, and you'll probably stick to it better than something you hate, and go to the gym with more drive and intensity. I'm a big believer that consistent effort is probably the most important thing you can make sure of. [PowerliftingToWin](http://www.powerliftingtowin.com/) is a great resource for training information and programming information, so I would recommend reading a bunch there.\n\n**CAN I DO THIS ROUTINE ONLY ONCE PER WEEK?**\n\nYou *could.* And that's all I'm gonna say. I wouldn't recommend it, because that'd put frequency of all the lifts at only once per week. If you can only run it once per week then I would recommend something like Greyskull LP, Stronglifts 5x5 or Starting Strength instead for increased frequency.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "A Linear Progression Based PPL Program for Beginners", "post_ups": 2420, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:15.276369", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "rabbit01", "post_created_utc": 1481360553.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1481422018.0, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "5hjc04", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 362, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2422, "post_selftext": "24 Years old - 110lbs > 170lbs - 5'10\" - 2.5 years\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1rurLra.jpg\n\nI know that these skinny to normal aren't always as popular but I thought I'd share my experience with Fittit as the eating struggles are the same battle but in reverse!\n\n\nI used to eat 1-2 meals a day if that, mostly small snacks and drinks.\n\nMy body always felt horrible, I was always getting sick and was permanently tired, waking up was a struggle every day.

Do you want to get better Grip Strength?\n\nGrip Strength Boost is a free 30-day program for forearm hypertrophy and grip strength. You only need a barbell with weights and something to hang from (pull up bar) to participate. It consists of 7 different exercises that are spread throughout the week with a high number of sets and reps. What are you waiting for? Let's start today!\n\nThere are two ways to do this program: You can do it with my **[Daily Follow-Along-Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMbhtPPa11I&amp;list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9)**, or just read the rep/set schemes in this post and do them in your own pace.\n\n### The Program\n\n**Who is this program for? It's for advanced beginners; people who have spent between 6 months and 3 years in a strength sport of their choice and want to focus on their grip strength for 30 days straight.**\n\n* This is a hypertrophy program. If you've trained for pure strength in your grip for some time, it's a good idea to mix in some hypertrophy focused exercises now and then. This program might be the missing link when you plateau. Almost all muscles in the forearms are slow-twitch muscles, which grow bigger much better from endurance-focused stimulus. That means, for the forearms, high reps/low weight are better for hypertrophy then low reps/high weight. The rest periods between the exercises are low, between 10 and 30 seconds.\n* You chose the weights yourself for each exercise, which means you'll need a few days to find the correct weight for you. Your muscles should have a good pump at the end of each training day. If you feel nothing, you need to go higher with the weights. If it's too hard, just lower the weight.\n* There are almost no rest days. Some days have much more volume then others.\n* The first two weeks have less volume and focus on getting used to the single exercises. The third and fourth week have a lot more volume and more exercises each day. This might look random at first, but it's not.\n* You will benchmark your progress at the end of every week by doing your max on all 7 exercises with 30 seconds rest in between.\n* Each training day takes about 5 to 15 minutes.\n* You do this program in addition to your normal workout!\n\n### The Exercises\n\nThere are 7 exercises in total in this program:\n\n* [Plate Pinches](https://i.imgur.com/eWbvm4l.png)\n* [Barbell Crush](https://i.imgur.com/luSW2wL.png)\n* [Barbell Support](https://i.imgur.com/T65YfIw.png)\n* [Wrist Curls](https://i.imgur.com/gfDO1vt.png)\n* [Reverse Wrist Curls](https://i.imgur.com/q6H0Goa.png)\n* [(Towel) Hanging](https://i.imgur.com/UwUPoX1.png)\n* [Fingertip Holds](https://i.imgur.com/ZsU5ofH.png)\n\n### Detailed Reps &amp; Sets\n\n**[You can also do Grip Strength Boost as a daily follow-along video (Click here).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMbhtPPa11I&amp;list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9)**\n\n[Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qVYcD7o_fs&index=2&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9)|[Day 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUvYlgr_yHA&index=3&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9)|[Day 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKylbyIDZ9c&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9&index=4)|[Day 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-7CrMO_1Dg&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9&index=5)|[Day 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5EdQ56qu6c&index=6&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9)|[Day 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1ZVHl0FFuk&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9&index=7)|[Day 7 (Benchmark)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFt1LOkpkCY&index=8&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9)\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--\n[^^Day ^^1 ^^Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qVYcD7o_fs&index=2&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9)|[^^Day ^^2 ^^Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUvYlgr_yHA&index=3&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9)|[^^Day ^^3 ^^Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKylbyIDZ9c&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9&index=4)|[^^Day ^^4 ^^Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-7CrMO_1Dg&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9&index=5)|[^^Day ^^5 ^^Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5EdQ56qu6c&index=6&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9)|[^^Day ^^6 ^^Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1ZVHl0FFuk&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9&index=7)|[^^Day ^^7 ^^Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFt1LOkpkCY&index=8&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9)\nHang - 8x15 sec.|Barbell Support - 6x30 sec.|Towel Hang - 6x15 sec.|Barbell Support - 9x10 sec.|Barbell Crush - 6x20 reps.|Fingertip Hold - 6x5 sec.|Double Towel Hang - MAX\nPlate Pinch - 8x15 sec.|Barbell Crush - 6x20 reps.|Fingertip Hold - 6x10 sec.|Plate Pinch - 9x10 sec.|Wrist Curl - 6x20 reps.|Plate Pinch 6x5 sec.|Barbell Support - MAX\n*No rest.*|*30 sec. rest between sets.*|Alt.

Just do the next program-day everytime you go to the gym. E.g: If you go to the gym 3 days a week, you exercise program-day 1+2+3 in that week. You will still make good progress this way!\n\n***\n\n**Question:** I have [insert medical condition], can i still do this program?\n\n**Answer:** Please talk to your doctor first. Don't start this program if you have pre-existing injuries. Since there are almost no rest days, it's going to be tough on your tendons and you don't want to aggravate pre-existing injuries!\n\n***\n\n**Question:** An exercise in this program is too hard for me, which exercise can i do instead?\n\n**Answer:** Change the exercise into an easier variation! For example kneeling fingertip holds, or normal hanging from the bar instead of towel hangs. If you can't complete the workout for the day because your fingers are too tired, stop and rest. Listen to your body.\n\n***\n\n**Question:** Can i do this program even though i workout regularily?\n\n**Answer:** YES! Grip Strength Boost is meant to be **in addition** to your normal workouts! Always do it after your normal workout so you don't tire out on your main lifts.\n\n***\n\n**Question:** What do i do after i have finished the 30 days challenge?\n\n**Answer:** Write me feedback on how it went, please! Thank you! Afterwards, i recommend switching to the **[Basic Routine by David Horne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGuVJAj96SE)**, which is the official r/GripTraining workout! It'll give you good gains for years to come.\n\n***\n\n**Question:** Do you have a printable **.pdf file**?\n\n**Answer:** **[.pdf file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/91p6tmle5u8p1pn/30%20Day%20Grip%20Strength%20Boost.pdf?dl=0)**, made by u/IsDaedalus!

I am around 8.5 weeks out from my very first show (NPC San Jose) and while I know that there are girls coming in who have much more experience and muscle definition, I'm hoping to show up really conditioned and take pride in the package I'm presenting on stage. I'm presenting this on my cakeday because it truly is my passion and what I'm MOST proud of: lifting heavy and eating clean every day.\n\nIf you want to know how I did it check out my blog: http://ilyssagetsfit.blogspot.com . In the About Me section in the top right corner there is a link to a 9 page google doc I've written out to answer any of your questions. [Quick Link Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BRnqHfnj_QkBPDY9xWFpwbaPNKQOtqPt9wWQR-tZ-WM/edit)\n\n**The most important thing for me to stress is that the reason I have gotten so lean, so quickly is because I do the big four movements with minor accessory isolation work to follow. I only do cardio 3 days a week, but I track every single macronutrient and calorie I take in (1900 cal a day even on this bikini cut). My deadlift has gone up to 225 pounds (though I'm positive I could pull more but don't train 1 rep maxes--I pulled 185 x 12 two weeks ago). I can squat my body weight and I'm pushing 95-100 pounds in my bench. I pick up iron and put it down. I'm not interested in machines that stabilize the weight for you. I'm not interested in \"bodypump\" classes that \"teach\" you how to incorporate weights into your routine. I lift heavy, every damn day, and have an amazing powerlifting team at San Jose State that supports me.**\n\nIf you find something in that doc that I still haven't answered I'm willing to answer it here. If you'd like to continue to watch my journey I'm @ohilyssa on instagram and @fanofpawl on MyFitnessPal.\n\nThank you all so much again for the continued support.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "On this cakeday, I'm not eating cake.

Hopefully through this post I can give whatever guidance or wisdom I have gained from this past year.\n\n[Here's the progress picture](https://i.imgur.com/RFNoM9p.png)\n\nIt all started a year ago today when out of boredom over the summer, I decided to begin \"working out\" seriously. I use quotations because for the first **6 months** everything I did was highly misguided and I was largely just making things up as I went. In that first 6 months, I did a variety of \"routines\" of sorts but all were very similar so I will tell you the one I remember best (and the one I likely did for the longest). The routine was 7 days a week, on one day, I would use a veeeeeeeery old (and pretty disfuntional) [Bowflex Motivator 2 machine my parents had lying around](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41JP6BVW98L.jpg) for an upper body workout, which consisted of curls, benchpress, and rows with the machine, followed by curls and lateral raises with dumbbells. The next day I would do a ~30 minute ab routine followed by what was usually a 2.5 mile run (sometimes more, sometimes less). I gravitated toward running as I used to be a cross-country runner (quit after an injury) but in my case **doing what was comfortable to me was not what was best for me** as I will explain later. The one thing to remain constant across the entire year was my drinking of protein shakes, as my goal was to get larger and stronger.\n\nNow there are a lot of mistakes to unpack with what I spent half of the year doing, and I will try my best to go through and explain just why most of it was highly inefficient. First of all, and most importantly: **If you are major skeleton mode like I was at the start, and your goal is to gain weight and muscle, *DO NOT RUN.*** Or at least, do not run as frequently as I did as, unless you are eating significantly more on the days you run to balance it out, weight gain is going to be made quite a lot more difficult if you add in any type of cardio, but especially running. However, this is to be considered relative to your goals, if you were, for example, an athlete, there are many benefits to running and cardiovascular training, but in my case, I am not an athlete and my sole goals were strength and gaining weight, both of which running hindered rather than helped. Second, in any form of fitness, you should use the internet to research what kinds of things you should be doing for your specific goals, but especially if you are trying to workout at home with less gear than there would be at a gym, you better make sure what you are doing is efficiently training your body as there are a lot of ineffective ways to do it. One such ineffective method I put to use was the circuit setup of a workout, wherein instead of doing multiple sets of each exercise one at a time, you do multiple \"rounds\" of doing one set of each exercise. Just to be more clear I was doing something like Bench -> Row -> Curl -> Bench -> Row -> Curl, etc when I should have been doing Bench -> Bench -> Row -> Row -> Curl -> Curl. I'm not entirely certain on the specific benefit of the latter setup to the former, but I am fairly certain one of the main reasons I struggled to gain muscle in the first 6 months was my use of a circuit rotation, which I found hardly ever even made me sore.\n\nIt was not until December 26, 2017 that I got a gym membership, and I believe it was then that I really started to get serious about my goals. Once I had a gym membership I stopped running altogether, started drinking protein shakes twice a day and really began trying my best to \"bulk up.\" Around mid January I picked the program that I would be on even up to now (though I am currently considering switching to another program). My program was [Metallicadpa's PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/?st=jdodcv98&sh=8771b4ba) which I found here on this reddit page. While I don't have any experience with any other programs, I do highly recommend this one for people like me who want to get stronger and larger and are willing to go to the gym 6 days per week.\n\nHere were my starting stats:\n\n* Deadlift: 95lbs x 5 reps\n* Squat: 100lbs x 5 reps (note here: Early on my squats were definitely too shallow, took me about 2 weeks to realize, I believe that is the main reason my squat was heavier than my deadlift at the start)\n* Bench: 75lbs x 5 reps\n* Overhead Press: Couldn't even get 1 rep on the bar, did dumbbells to work up to it\n\nNote here that despite my **6 months** of \"training\" prior to this, my lifts still seemed very much like that of an untrained beginner. I believe this highlights the significance of all the mistakes I previously mentioned. However, that is not to say I believe what I did in those 6 months did not help me, they were very important to me. First of all, the first 6 months I'm sure in some way did make me stronger, and certainly larger (I gained somewhere between 10 and 15 pounds in that time). But the most significant part of the first 6 months was that it helped me form the habit of exercise. Not once since going to the gym have I ever felt unmotivated or had I day were I just didn't feel like it. There are a variety of factors that may have lead to this attitude but I would like to believe a significant contributor was the fact that I had already formed the habit, so it was something my mind and body were already used to.\n\nCurrent stats:\n\n* Deadlift: 205lbs x 5 reps\n* Squat: 170lbs x 5 reps\n* Bench: 120lbs x 5 reps\n* Overhead Press: 80lbs x 5 reps\n\nWhile all my advice so far has been very technical, I'd like to conclude with some more motivational and abstract wisdom to everyone reading. Even if it is not fitness related, I believe everyone can find a constructive hobby. For me, weightlifting was the perfect hobby, I love the feeling of working out and as an avid video game player, I can appreciate the grind of it. For you, maybe exercise isn't quite so pleasant, but I do encourage you to find some other way you can both enjoy, and better yourself. I believe hobbies like these are very important for mental, and in my case physical, health. For me, lifting helped me through what was probably the most stressful part of my life so far (junior year of high school with 5 AP classes). I believe everyone can find a hobby that they can use to take their mind off things and just enjoy the moment.\n\n**If you read nothing else in this post, I hope you read this bit on motivation** Personally I have found the most important factor in motivation is appreciating the progress you have made. It is very easy to get caught up in the never ending pursuit of improvement, but it is very important every now and then to look back and realize how far you have come (such as in this reddit post). There was a post on r/getmotivated a few days ago that I feel encapsulates this idea pretty well, it was the following quote: \"Remember when you wanted what you have now.\" This quote hit me especially hard, as even though I still currently hope to become larger and stronger than I am, I have to realize that over the past year, I have already become larger and stronger than I was.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this, I hope something of what I said helped you in some way.\n\nEDIT: WOW! Posted this before going to sleep and woke up to 100+ comments and 1k+ upvotes. There are far too many positive comments for me to thank each individually so I just wanted to say a sincere thank you to everyone. Honestly I was somewhat reluctant to even make this post, by the time I finished I thought there would be no way anyone would have taken the time to read the whole thing through, but by that point I had invested so much time I just posted it anyway. Again thank you to everyone and just as a final reminder: I'm just a regular dude, and any of you can change yourself just as I have if you put your mind to it. Even I had my doubts when I started but if you take anything away from this post I hope it's this: Don't let anything stop you.

It was honestly one of the worst periods of time in my life so far. My dad developed Limbic Encephalitis, my brother developed testicular cancer, and my grandpa died of a brain tumor all within about a year. All of this was too much to handle and, long story short, I felt like food was the one thing I could control in my life. I always felt cold, alone and empty from anorexia. I woke up and would basically be a zombie, walking from one place to the next. I obsessed over food and calories way too much. This knowledge of food and calories actually came into use once I started lifting, but for this period of time it was too much to worry about. I was 13/14 and thinking about how many calories I was eating in a day \u2013 not good.\n\n**Anorexia Recovery**:\n\n* I can confidently say that it wasn\u2019t until my sophomore year of college (when I started lifting for the first time) that I was able to recover from anorexia. I went through nutritionists and therapists for years. Through everything, my parents were the biggest help, and were (and still are) my biggest encouragers when I started lifting and gaining weight.\n\n===\n**My first year of lifting (December 2014-December 2015)**\n\t\n* I was motivated to find a way to help me gain weight. I played tennis in high school, which helped maintain weight. I knew that doing something like tennis (an activity) would help me gain weight. \nIt was hard at first. I was moving toward full recovery around when I started lifting, but it was still difficult to eat everything I needed to. As a result, I didn\u2019t do everything right for the first half year of lifting. I ate too little, worked out too much, and was way too stressed. I didn\u2019t even have a routine I followed, I just did what one of my friends told me to do in the gym and didn\u2019t get anywhere with it. I did this for about the first six months of working out.\n\n* After six months of messing around, I landed on PPL as my first official routine. I honestly think I picked PPL because a hypertrophy-based program seemed safer to me. Big lifts were intimidating to me at this point, and PPL seemed like a good mixture of accessory stuff and big lifts (and was getting good reception at the time). I probably should have started with SS. PPL was great, but was a bit too much for how much I WASN\u2019T eating.\n\n* The PPL Routine that I used was Coolcicada\u2019s routine WITH deadlifts mixed in. It was a consistent Push, Pull, Legs \u2013 Push, Pull, Legs \u2013 Rest (PPLPPLR). I ended up doing way too much volume, but it\u2019s what got me comfortable with the major lifts. I ended up doing this routine for about the next six months.\n\n===\n**After 1 year/ Up to now**:\n\n* After the first full year, I knew that I wasn\u2019t eating enough and that I needed to eat more in order to NOT waste the time I was putting into lifting. I absolutely loved lifting at this point in time \u2013 coming into the gym every day to challenge myself. To improve, to get better at something I loved was what brought me back to most days. \n\n* I watched videos, frequented r/fitness and did my best to work on form, eating big and lifting big. I had started to count calories again, but instead of counting calories to lose weight (like before), I was counting calories to gain weight.\n\n* I began doing Arnold\u2019s Blueprint after the first year. I decided to do it just to do something different \u2013 to do something more fun. It was great to mix things up, but was pretty hard to keep track of my lifting numbers.\n\n* I saw another Redditor\u2019s progress post while looking at r/fitness one day and saw him mention Lazar Angelev\u2019s routine. I was looking honestly for something I wouldn\u2019t have to stress out too much about (was working on finals in college when I was looking to switch routines) and saw this workout as a pretty good option, just to mix things up, which brings me to today. I saw a post yesterday about Jacked and Tan 2.0 that interested me - I'll probably give it a shot once classes start again. I know I have so much to improve on - my lifts are, for the most part, pretty weak, and I want to work on that. I am happy that lifting was able to help me get out of a pretty rough patch in life, but now look forward to actually getting **stronger.**\n\n\n---\n---\n\n\n\n***Diet***:\n===\n\n* Anorexia recovery got me in touch with a lot of nutritionists. Through this I was able to learn a ton about nutrition, calories, macros, etc. I learned a lot during this time that contributed to a growing knowledge of necessary diet and nutrition today.\n\n* I started eating not enough when I was lifting. I wasn\u2019t losing weight, but wasn\u2019t gaining any at a good rate. I was basically maintaining but didn\u2019t even realize it.\n\n* When I got more serious about gaining weight, I found IIFYM. Started hitting a 40/40/30 Split each day. I weighed myself every morning, took the average at the end of the week, and repeated that, comparing my weights at the end of each week to see how much weight I was gaining. I still try to follow this as best I can, but haven\u2019t done it as frequently since the summer started.\n\n* I\u2019m a student living on my own over the summer, trying to manage slow-bulking on a budget. I am attempting to eat about 3,000 calories per day: ~165g Protein, ~400g Carbs, ~80g Fat. A typical day right now would look like:\n\no\tBreakfast:\n\n* 3 Eggs, \u00bd Cup Oatmeal, Banana, Yogurt, \u00bd Cup Cottage Cheese, Peanut Butter\n\n===\n\no\tLunch: Something like stir-fry or Mexican-style\n\n* Lotta Rice\n* Lotta Chicken\n* Veggies\n* Tortilla Wrap\n* Greek Yogurt\n* Peanut Butter\n\n===\no\tShake after Workout:\n\n* 2/3 Cup Milk\n* 1 Scoop Protein Powder\n* \u00bd Cup Oats\n* Peanut Butter\n* Cocoa Powder\n\n===\no\tDinner: \n\n* Pasta/ Potatoes\n* Chicken/ Beef\n* Broccoli\n* More Peanut Butter\n* More tortillas\n\n===\no\tSnacks:\n\n* Nuts, granola, oatmeal, more peanut butter\n\n---\n---\n\n\n**Other things**:\n===\n\nI know I haven\u2019t don\u2019t everything right. There is still a TON for me to learn, and I don\u2019t want to pretend like I know everything. I\u2019ve tried my best to learn from and stick to the wisdom that everyone\u2019s offered on reddit and in the gym. Some of the most important things I\u2019ve learned on this journey and from these people are:\n\n* This is a marathon, not a sprint.\n\n *  Healthy consistency has been super important for me, especially coming from a disease that feeds off of unhealthy consistency. There are days that I don\u2019t get to lift, but as long as I stick to a thought-out diet and exercise, in the long run the goals that I have will be reached.\n\n* Lifting isn\u2019t everything\n\n * At first I replaced my under-eating with lifting, which led to pretty unhealthy lifting behavior. Instead of planning my day around lifting, I started planning lifting around my day. I haven\u2019t dropped my relationships or hobbies to lift \u2013 I\u2019ve simply picked up lifting as a means to living a healthy lifestyle, which works for me.\n\n* Discipline\n\n * Discipline is what keeps me going when I motivation gets low. Some days (though few) I don\u2019t want to go into the gym \u2013 it\u2019s discipline that keeps me going and striving towards the goals that I have.\n\nIf you have a goal and are trying to reach something \u2013 in lifting, life, relationships, job, etc. \u2013 keep on fighting for it. This journey has been an incredible one, and I look forward to what this next season brings. \n\n===\n---\n\n**Thank you for encouraging me and helping me beat this anorexia thing, reddit!

I've come back to find so much encouragement and a ton of people who are, or who have been, in a similar spot. One of the biggest things i've seen people asking about is if they have anorexia or if it means they're anorexic if they were at the same body weight as me - this isn't necessarily true. Anorexia is very much a mental disorder - I knew guys when I was 110lbs that were the same weight as me. They, however, did not have anorexia. Why? Because our mindsets were completely different. My mindset was so focused on restricting calories and obsessed with body image, while the other guy's was not. It's a mindset that made me anorexic, not the body weight. \n\nSeriously, you're all awesome. If you need anything, or have any more questions, let me know. I'll try to answer as many questions as I can. Anorexia's a deep and dark place - it takes loving/caring people to help get out of it.

It has truly impacted my life for the better. \n\nA couple months ago I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease called Ankylosing Spondylitis. It's a pretty rare genetic disease that causes my body to attack my joints, causing inflammation and eventually turning them into solid bone. My sacroiliac joints are already fused, and my spine may follow. \n\nI still lift weights, I do it safely, and my doctors have not placed me on any activity restrictions. Yet, I am unilaterally blocked from mentioning my disease on this subreddit. \n\n> Advice about or for working around any medical condition or concern, such as: sickness, disease, medication, injury, pain, recent medical procedure, disabilities\n\nI do not see how this specific part of Rule #5 benefits the community. Work-arounds are an *essential* part of fitness, and are difficult to discover without trial-and-error. I'm a nurse, big proponent of the fact that **no one should ever disregard medical advice for any reason**, but stifling discussion of *targeted program modification* does nothing but make it harder for people to exchange valuable information that can prevent injuries. \n\nI have seen this explained by moderators as \"well, it's a liability problem.\" How is it any more of a liability problem than regular posts? Are healthy people running PPL, then suing the internet when they get an overuse strain? I want to lift safely, I want to try new routines, I want to improve my fitness. Everyone does. Pretending I have no special circumstances does nothing but hinder me from receiving relevant information. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**Edit**\n\n*Enjoying the discussion. Even though I disagree, big thank you to the mods for taking their time to offer explanations for their interpretation of the rule.*\n\n**To summarize my stance: people with managed, chronic diseases should not be lumped in with sports injuries and people seeking medical advice. I am not more at risk from bad lifting techniques than anyone else.**\n\n**Edit 2**\n\n[Since this is somehow relevant](https://i.imgur.com/WHWhffM.jpg)", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Can we have a discussion about Rule #5?", "post_ups": 2368, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9odmik/can_we_have_a_discussion_about_rule_5/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:15.277366", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "eg71", "post_created_utc": 1392039255.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "1ximyy", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 837, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2366, "post_selftext": "Man, it's easy to let your weight get out of control!

For the full duration of the cut I ate at 2000 kcal.  Understanding TDEE goes down as body weight goes down, I never adjusted for it.  Also, I'm a single dad.  I have sole custody of my two toddler girls, ages 2 and 3.  Unfortunately, iifym.com cannot calculate the calorie burn this kind of task accounts for but I can tell you it is SUBSTANTIAL.  Wrangling two nuggets on a daily basis (in a two-story townhouse mind you) at times makes deadlifting seem like a vacation.  Judging by how fast the excess weight came off, I'm certain I was eating at a much larger deficit than 700 kcal, but I can't really say how much.  At only 10 weeks in, I was down 22 lbs.  [Here I am at week 10 of the cut at 163 lbs](http://i.imgur.com/LDCQvsm.jpg)(with a post workout pump and under bad lighting)\n\n**DIET**  \n\n2000 kcal per day  \nMacro goals were 35%protein, 35%fat, 30%carbs  \n175g protein  \n78g fat  \n150g carbs  \n\n**Breakfast, lunch, and snacks nearly every monday-friday throughout the cut looked like this:**  \negg salad (three whole eggs, 1 tbsp canola mayo, mustard, tobasco)    \n1/2 cup cottage cheese  \n6 oz turkey breast sandwich    \n1.25 cup plain greek yogurt  \n3 oz turkey breast   \n25 baby carrots  \n\nDinner varied greatly.  I really enjoy cooking and used my remaining 1000 kcal dinner allowance on a wide variety of tasty shit.  Usually one of the following:  \n\n10 oz grilled teriyaki chicken thighs with jasmine rice and stir fry veggies  \n\nEggs, egg white, and MorningStar soy sausage patty breakfast bowl topped with colby jack and grilled onions  \n\n12 oz wok seared sweet and sour chicken breast with garlic brown rice  \n\nTwo 5 oz mahi-mahi fish burgers  \n\nFish tacos with 8 oz of cod and pan fried skin on potatoes  \n\nHomemade philly steak and cheese made with 10 oz of petite sirloin steak  \n\nTwo PB & J sandwiches and 2 cups plain greek yogurt! For those extra lazy days!  \n\nBeer braised, lime and salsa slow cooker chicken breast made into burritos  \n\nSouthwest chicken breast quesadillas using 10 oz chicken breast  \n\nTwo 1/4 lb homemade angus burgers  \n\n**Hydration and supplements**  \nI drank around 64 oz of water daily but primary liquid was diet soda and zero cal energy drinks.  I drank a TON of that stuff.  Fresca, Diet 7up, white Rockstars and blue Monsters.  \n\nI take the Kirkland brand Performance Multivitamin daily.  I supplemented with Myprotein Impact Whey (cookies and cream!) just a handful of times when I was low on protein for the day.    \n\nI ended my cut during the 2nd week of August 2014 and bumped my intake up to 2300 kcal.  I promptly went from 151 lbs to 155 lbs and have stayed there since.  I fought relentlessly to keep my lift numbers from declining.  I initially took a big hit on bench press and deadlift and was able to gradually climb back.  Squat is the only lift that stayed stable throughout and actually made a slow increase.  \n\nFrom here I will continue eating at 2300 kcal and focus on programming for strength.  \n\n**EDIT**  \nI can't thank all of you enough for the kind words! And the gold! Thanks so much! I'm completely floored!  \nI'm absolutely humbled to provide any sort of motivation for anyone looking to do something similar.  Reading other people's submissions about their progress and ideas was critical to my own motivation.   \n\nI'm currently at work and it's taking every bit of will power to stay off reddit right now but I really look forward to replying to as many comments as I can when I get some free time tonight.  Thanks again!

I was sitting/playing video games at home for like 3 years and doing nothing but that and eating.\n\nI was about 101kg before I started losing weight, but not with going to the gym. I started doing alot of Bodyweight/Hiit exercises at home while I was in a big caloric deficit like 1000- from my maintanence. That was also the time I started to learn a profession (IT technician) because I no longer wanted to play video games anymore (because I got bored of it). I basically wanted to play real life haha. For the weight loss it was going really good, I lost atleast 0,7-1kg about every 3 days.In total I lost about 34kg. After 8 months I had 67kg and decided that I want to do weight training. So I went to a gym and got a membership. I started @ 01.01.2017 like a new years resolution right? Maybe. I don't like if people set new year resolutions like they need a new year to start something. You don't need a new year to start anything, you can start right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway my Physique started to change very quickly after joining the gym, that was also the point where I was informing myself about fitness alot like nutrition/training/supplements to maximize my gains.\n\nMy first split was basically a 4 day bro split. People hate on bro splits alot which is understandable (I would never do them anymore) but for a newbie it was totally okay and I made some good gains.\n\nAfter that I went hardcore and switched to a 6day PPLxPPL. And I made incredible gains with that split. Even though it had alot of volume I managed to do it for 8months or so. (this is where my bench/deadlift started to increase)\n\nAnd right now I'm doing a 4-5 Split (PHUL) which is pretty good for me (alot of Volume).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I don't exactly know what happened in my head that I changed from playing video games non stop to going to the gym and having a life (I guess I was bored from video games) working, living in my own apartment, having a girlfriend but I like it and it was the best decision I ever made, I'm very happy right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If anyone is interested in my lifts.**\n\nMy 1RM right now are:\n\nBench: 90KG (low as fuck I know)\n\nSumo Deadlift: 150kg\n\nSumo Squat: 130kg\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I do sumos because I was born with  shortened Achilles tendon and clubfeet, my balance is really bad.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Body:**\n\n174cm\n79,5kg\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf any of you are in the same position that I was 2 years before or got any questions you may want to ask, feel free to ask.\n\nI'm a very helpful kind of person especially when it comes to fitness because it's such an interesting topic for me :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf there were any spelling/grammar mistakes I made, I apologize.

Rows, flys, curls, hammer curls, chin ups, shrugs. I try a lot of different things and shoot for 3x10-15.  As long as I get a good compound lift in, I'm happy, and the rest is for fun.

I don't have set cheat meals or days, I don't like getting caught up in that mentality.  Bottom line is its calories in, calories out for me, with a focus on macros.

By about 8 years after college, by weight had ballooned from 280 to 380.  The picture in the progress is one of the closest decent ones, but may not be my very heaviest. \n\nIn march 2014 I decided to make a change and hit the gym pretty hard, mainly focusing on cardio, something I hated with a passion before. I started with 30 minutes on the elliptical 5 days a week + weights. Adding to that walking/jogging with my dog, and trying to do something for a couple hours every weekend, mainly hiking and jogging. Weight lifting was the same core lifts I'd done in college, Bench, inclinde, OHP, Rosws, tricep extensions, curls, squat, leg extensions, deadlifts, calf raises and an ab  workout.   Mostly 3x5 or 5x5 sets. \n\nI also dramatically changed how I was eating. Gave up fast food entirely as well as most processed stuff. I started logging everything I eat in a cell phone app. (I still think Noom is a better written app, but I use MFP as well for certain features it has). \n\nBy about the year mark (march 2015) I decided I would sign up for a warrior dash as an aspirational goal, I'd never run any significant distance before, but I discovered that even at 265 ish, it was suddenly easier than it had been before. THe warrior dash in April 2015 was my first 5k.   Since I've done about 6 5k's, an 8k, and 2 10k's.  My 5k time is ~28 minutes.  I did my second warrior dash a few weeks ago and finished in under 38 minutes, which is the source of the pictures.    I also mix in HIIT workouts once or twice a week. \n\nI'm already signed up for a tough mudder 10 mile in october, which is my next aspirational goal. \n\nThe first hundred pounds came off super fast, 9 months.   Going from 275 to 225 has taken much of the rest of the time with some ups and downs. I had a rotator cuff tear and a broken hand last fall that kept me from working out for a while.  I was stalled in the 240's for about 6 months and redoubled my efforts after the new year to log every calorie and stick to an exact diet.   THe recent posts about the biggest loser contestants caught my attention because my TDEE is also somewhat lower than it should be given my weight. Even with pretty significant workouts, my TDEE at this point is only 2400 calories or so, and I can lose a pound a week or a bit less if I successfully stick to 1700 and 5-6 good workouts in  My mind did adjust to healthier tastes, but I absolutely still have problems knowing when I'm full and still have cravings. \n\nDespite being at a fairly consistent calorie deficit, I've raised my bench since the prior post, going to a 275 1RM.   My squat's gone down a bit, I can still rep out 315, but would have  issues doing a full 5x5 set of it like I could before, I can do 5 reps, 3-4 sets.  My hands are the weak point on my deadlift so I'm working on that too. \n\nAt this point I want to stay about 225, but I'm going to work on getting my bodyfat a bit lower without a specific goal weight in mind.  Tape measure method says my bodyfat is 22% right now, but lose skin makes it look worse, and I'm considering getting a scan done on that.  I'd like to be maybe 15%. \n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Updated Progress Pics: Male 32, 25 months in, 380 to 225.", "post_ups": 2354, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4ien9y/updated_progress_pics_male_32_25_months_in_380_to/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:15.277366", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "MrRedTRex", "post_created_utc": 1442699314.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "3lluwe", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 1879, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2355, "post_selftext": "Or am I just irredeemably ugly?

The owners of the gym have managed to hire on some great people that embody their core values.  The trainers are always there to encourage and challenge you. \n\nWhen I first signed up I got some flak from my girlfriend because it is more expensive than most people would consider reasonable for a gym - $150 a month. This was actually a blessing in disguise because when you're spending that much money you're going to show up as much as you can. I started showing up 3x a week and it became a habit. \n\nUp until this year the best I had done was stick with P90x for about 3 months at a time and then drop off. This was hard to stick to because I was alone in my living room with no one to push me or help me correct my form. Also I was doing the same 3 workouts 3x a week and never really advancing. \n\nOne of the first things the coach said to me is that weightlifting is very 'humbling', I don't think I really knew what he meant until recently. When I started, I was a pretty average build with a beer belly and some love handles. Unfortunately I still have a belly and love handles but I have seen more definition in my arms, shoulders and chest than I ever have before. I have realized that even though I've been busting my ass for 6 months and not reached where I expected to be, this isn't some sort of fad diet, it's the beginning of a new lifestyle change for me. \n\nThis is where I realized that even though I'm not where I thought I would be after 6 months of training, I'm now 100% fine with knowing that **I'm in the process of getting better**. \n\nThe mindset shift from \"I'm not where I want to be\" to \"I'm in the process of getting to where I want to be\" has affected all aspects of my life. By making a habit out of weight lifting, I am always feeling like I'm making progress in at least one area of my life.\n\nBefore I would often compare myself to other people that I would perceive as doing better than me. I recently realized that I no longer compare myself, I've accepted that I'm striving to improve and that's all that I can do. \n\nThis has in effect 'humbled' me and allowed me to accept that I need to stay consistent in any area of my life to get to where I want to be. I think many of us are guilty of wanting something that we don't yet deserve. Our culture is hooked on instant gratification but it's really the people who put in work that get the real gratification. \n\nNow that I'm more at ease about my life, it's easier for me to be grateful for what I have going for me rather than comparing myself to others and noticing what I lack. This training of my body has indirectly been training for my mental health. \n\nI've become a little more confident however I have always been a bit over weight and have never been confident taking my shirt off in public. I've never been more certain in my life that I will get there. I have never felt what it's like to be 100% confident with my body but I can imagine that it will have even more positive impacts on my mental health. I'm 27 years old and I live in Florida.... What a waste it would be if I didn't take advantage of this time in my life to become the best version of myself.

I was overweight from when I was about 8-14 years old, until I decided to sporadically crash diet all throughout high school, my lowest weight reaching 125lb (I'm 5'9\"). During my high school years, I rarely exercised. I was constantly gaining and losing weight. Finally, after high school, I decided to make a lifestyle change. With the help of my boyfriend who had already been lifting for 4+ years at the time, I made the transition from no exercise to weight lifting. It has been a little over 2 years since I've decided to make this lifestyle change, and I could not be happier with how I feel about myself. I go to the gym and lift weights 5-6 times per week, and work in at least 3-4 15 minute sessions of HITT on the stairmaster in addition to the weights. I also started counting my macros about 2 months ago. I now weigh around 140-145lb. I'm on \"cutting\" macros right now, and hope to lose maybe 5-7 more pounds, but for now I am so happy with the progress I have made! \n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/a/wcBBm\n\nINFO:\nSex: female\nAge: 21\nHeight: 5'9\"\nWeight: 140-145\nWeight lifting Routine: I lift as heavy as I can 5-6 days a week. Most recently I have been trying to squeeze in 2-3 leg days a week since that is what I have been trying to improve on the most. For leg days I will do a variation of about 5 of these exercises: leg press, squats, deadlifts, straight leg deadlifts, smith machine lunges, hamstring curls, single leg press, calf raises. \nThe other days I'll work upper body, and I've been splitting it between arms and shoulders and chest and back. Again for these I do the basics: bicep curls, tricep pulldowns, bench press, lat pulldowns. Nothing too out of the ordinary. \nCardio routine: I try to do cardio the days I don't work legs at the gym, because obviously my legs are too dead after to get on the stairmaster. But on the stairs I do 15 minutes of 30 second intervals, alternating between level 18 and level 1. It has taken me a long time to build up to this, and whenever it gets \"easier\" I will bump it up a level. \nCaloric intake: I eat anywhere around 1500-1600 calories a day, and am following a macro diet. I try to eat as many whole foods as I can, but I do eat processed things here and there. I also eat some form of protein with every meal. Once a week cheat meal including dessert. \n\n***to clarify: the overweight picture is the shower picture. Not the cruise picture. The cruise picture is just when I decided to start my fitness journey. I was not overweight by any means there, just unhealthy from lack of exercise and a poor diet.

Due to this \ndisease, I had to relearn how to walk, then jog and cycle, and after six months, run. \nSince then I have recovered fully, but my shoulders have really bad issues due to my \nposture and the weakening of the shoulder muscles. I started going to gym about two \nyears ago, but never took it seriously, as my muscles were too weak and I was \nembarrassed. \n\nThen, January this year I went to the USA on exchange for a semester and started \neating like crazy. I also started lifting, getting serious around March doing stronglifts. \n\nI went from [53kg](http://imgur.com/a/pcHz1#CxHQVbY) (pre bulk) up to [63kg](http://imgur.com/a/pcHz1#CxHQVbY) bodyweight (so much more fat!) and then down to 61kg in 7 months. I now \nlift 3-4 times a week doing a modified linear progression workout - Squat + Bench on \nMonday, Deadlift + OHP Wednesday, Squat + Bench Friday and sometimes \nSaturday, switch every second week, with weighted dips and chins as accessories.\n\nI also just started HIIT cycling twice a week to get rid of some of the fat I have been building.\n\nToday I achieved a personal goal of 100kg squat for 1 rep, barefoot, low bar and was \ntold it was 'good form' by the gym instructor. I don't have a video of this achievement, \nbut here is [92.5kg x3] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDC7f3KgAUc&feature=youtu.be) I did two weeks ago. I have been working on form strictly for \ntwo weeks, so I improved anything I could see wrong with that lift.\n\nMy other lifts are:\n\n 50kg overhead press x5\n\n75kg bench x5\n\n115kg deadlift x3\n\nMy diet consists of 2500-3000 calories a day. Every day I have Eggs, tuna, LOTS of low fat milk (lactose intolerance), chicken or tofu, and lots of fruit and veges, plus protein shake or bar on lifting days.\n\n\nMy Next goal is now to get 150 deadlift and 65kg body weight. \n\n\nI really wanted to thank this community for getting me interested in lifting, and being \nsupportive. I hope that my story is just one of many that goes to show, even when \nthings are looking really really down (even to the point of temporary paralysis) and \nyou doubt yourself, you can still achieve your goals.\n\n\nEdit: wow this blew up! I really appreciate the positive feedback from everyone. I know I have a lot work to do still with my form, but im sure I'll get there!

It's cheap, and all I can afford at the moment.\nHowever, my PF wasn't all that bad. It had squat rack, plenty of benches and dumbells, and I was able to do my workouts without hindrance.

I of course had to ask an employee \"WTF?\" He regretfully told me that a few days prior corporate came in and removed it because \"a customer complained that it was intimidating\"...\n\nAgain, what the fuck.\n\nSo, me and my friend (extremely pissed) decided to come to Reddit to see if we can't do something funny to PF for this horrible act. we came up with the idea to get a bunch of people to email corporate PF and speak our minds about how \"intimidating\" their circuit training section is, and that we'd feel better working out there if it were removed. I can only imagine if a few thousand emails got sent in about this. They'd be dumbfounded.\n\nIn the meantime, my friend and I are trying to figure out if we can swing paying to go to LA Fitness. Hopefully we'll be able to get out of the anti-gym for good. I honestly am embarrassed that I go there, but as  I said it's been my only option financially.\n\nSorry for the vent/pointless post.

As so eloquently written by [this guy](http://aaronbleyaert.tumblr.com/post/109959086957), heartbreak really can be an important step towards self improvement - but I don't want to dwell too much on that. After a couple of months of feeling bad for myself I joined a local gym chain and started working out. \n\nBefore I get too deep into the details, [Here's](http://imgur.com/8vyn7bt) a progress pic. Unfortunately I didn't take many pics before I started training. Starting weight was 165-170lbs. \n\n**The Routine:**\n\nFor the first ~9 months of lifting, I ran a bro-split program (chest/tris, back/bis, shoulders, legs) 3-5 times a week, repeating days as necessary. I enjoyed doing this and saw some progress, but suffered from fuckarounditis - even though I was tracking all of my workouts using the iOS app Strong, I wasn't working towards any specific goals, hadn't put much thought into creating a balanced program, and frequently neglected leg day and working to make progress on my compound lifts. By the time I was done with this routine, I could bench more than I could squat or deadlift...\n\nOn July 24th I started running [metallicadpa's PPL routine] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/), 6 days a week, with some modifications. I've been through the full routine roughly 9-10 times (some days skipped due to injury) and have been really happy with my progress on my compound lifts and appearance. \n\nHere's my specific routine as I run it right now:\n\n**Pull Day** (Twice a week with slight variation)\n\n*EITHER* Deadlifts 3x5 @ 235lbs *OR* Bent Over Barbell Rows 5x5 @ 170lbs \n \nWeighted Pull-ups 5x5 @ BW+60lbs, with BW only warmup and back off sets\n\nLat Pulldown 3x12 @ 125\n\nSeated Cable Row 3x12 @ 150\n\nFace Pull 5x15 @ 30lbs\n\nIncline Curls 4x12 @ 30lbs/side\n\nBarbell Curls 4x12 @ 60lbs \n\nPreacher Curl 4x12 @ 65 lbs\n\nI'll also throw in some supersets of bodyweight neutral grip pull-ups and hanging leg raises at the end, if I have time/energy.\n\n**Push Day** (Twice a week with slight variation)\n\n*EITHER* Bench Press 5x5 @ 185lbs *OR* Overhead Press 5x5 @ 105lbs\n\n*EITHER* Overhead Press 3x12 @ 75lbs *OR* Bench Press 3x12 @ 135lbs (whichever wasn't done 5x5 first that day)\n\nIncline Bench Press 3x12 @ 100lbs\n\nWeighted Dips 5x12 @ 60lbs, with BW only warmup and back off sets\n\nSkull Crushers 3x12 @ 60lbs\n\nCable Tricep Pushdown 3x12 @50lbs\n\nLateral Raise 5x12 @ 15lbs/side\n\n**Leg Day** (Twice a week, same both times)\n\nSquats 3x5 @ 215lbs\n\nRomanian Deadlift 3x12 @ 190lbs\n\nLeg Press 3x12 @ 423lbs\n\nLeg Curl 3x12 @ 115lbs\n\nCalf Raise (Machine) 5x12 @ 150lbs\n\nSince starting this routine (7/24-10/7), my big three lifts have progressed as follows (5 rep maxes):\n\nBench Press 155lbs -> 185lbs\n\nDeadlift 145lbs -> 235lbs\n\nSquat 145lbs -> 215lbs\n\nEarly on I also completed C25k and came close to finishing C10K, but stopped due to knee and back pain. I haven't really gotten back into running or cardio of any sort, but would like to in the future.\n\n**Diet:**\n\nBreakfast: Whey in water and a banana, or full fat Greek yogurt with whey and a banana mixed in\n\nLunch: Grilled chicken, hard-boiled eggs, spinach, avocados\n\nDinner: Salad with tomatoes, peppers, onions, cucumbers, cheese, sometimes grilled chicken or hard-boiled eggs, and oil & vinegar\n\nSnacks: Almonds, apples, whey in water\n\nDrinks: Coffee, water, all the alcohol (seriously this is my biggest downfall)\n\nOf course there's a ton of variation but the above is a decent look at what I eat most days. I used MFP for about a month to hammer out the macros I wanted. I still weigh my food and follow a similar profile to the one I did when I was doing MFP. I try to eat at maintenance, roughly 2200-2300 calories/day broken down as 144g protein, 77g fat, 260g carbs. \n\n**Supplements:**\n\nDaily: Multivitamin, 2g Fish Oil, 5000 IUs Vitamin D, 5g Creatine \n\nOccasionally: C4 or Amino Energy pre workout, ZMA, Melatonin\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\n* Don't be so obsessed with progress at all costs - early on, and to some extent to this day, I allowed myself to become addicted to progress and not skipping days. As a result, I hurt my knees by running too much too soon, hurt my back pushing my deadlifting weight up without giving enough care to form, and hurt my shoulders benching. I wish I could tell my former self that working through these injuries would just lead to more setbacks than just taking time off in the first place.\n\n* Find a good program and stick to it - I wish I found and started using the PPL program I'm on now way earlier. I enjoy it way more than I enjoyed my original splits routine, and I've made much better progress since starting it.\n\n* Just start - for years I would obsess over finding the perfect workout routine and the right gym to do it in, rather than just going to the gym and doing something. I wish I had started years earlier, even if it was with a fuckarounditis routine (sort of contradicts my previous point I suppose). \n\n* Discipline over motivation - my divorce was initially a great source of motivation for me to get to the gym, but over time that faded and discipline took over. Over the past several months I've managed to impress myself by getting to the gym regardless of social plans, travel, or hangovers sent by the devil himself. \n\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nRight now I'm chasing a 2 plate bench and 3 plate squat and deadlift. Hoping to make serious progress towards those goals by the end of the year. Also considering doing a clean bulk at some point this winter, but scared of getting fat (jk, kind of). \n\nCouldn't have done it without /r/fitness. This subreddit has proved to be a great resource and source of motivation for me. I read the majority of the posts and try to absorb as much information as I can.\n\n[Some more pics](http://imgur.com/a/p5Rju)\n\nHappy to answer any questions!", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Exactly one year since I started lifting and changed my life for the better - here are the results (M/29/5'8\"/155lbs)", "post_ups": 2304, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/56ex2y/exactly_one_year_since_i_started_lifting_and/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:15.277366", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Morbid__Throwaway", "post_created_utc": 1427072977.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2zyp74", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 1606, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2300, "post_selftext": "I'm a 20 year old male and I weigh 305.8 pounds.

If the world were fair, that would be true.\n\nHowever, all of the available evidence tends to indicate that genetics play a pretty huge role; AT MINIMUM genetics seem to account for a ~4-fold difference in muscle growth between high and low responders.\n\nPractice, on the other hand (based on a recent meta-analysis), seems to account for less than 1/4 of the total variability in results in most domains.  Now, that doesn't mean it only accounts for 1/4 of your total results, but if the top performers had a rating of 100 and the worst performers had a rating of zero, practice/effort would likely move you up fewer than 25 points on that scale.\n\n-On the other hand, I see a lot of people blaming their genetics for their lack of results when they simply haven't been training for long enough to know whether they have good genetics.  Similarly, I see a lot of people make assumptions about how good their genetics/someone else's genetics are based on how big and/or strong they were before they started lifting.\n\nHowever, research consistently shows that high and low responders initially start with the same amount of lean body mass, the same size muscle fibers, and the same initial strength on average.  In other words, where you start is *not at all predictive* of how well you'll respond to training.\n\nSimilarly, strength gains are roughly the same on average between high and low responders for at least the first 8-12 weeks of training, and new research is showing (or at least verifying; if you've spent much time in the gym, this is probably something you've already noticed) that we aren't just different in regards to how strongly we respond to training; different people also respond best to different styles of training.  This is also likely influenced by genetics.\n\nSo, before you can blame your genetics for your lack of progress, you probably need close to a year under the bar, giving at least 3-4 different training styles an honest shot (full effort, high expectations, a positive attitude, and taking care of business outside the gym) for at least 3 months apiece.\n\ntl;dr \u2013 genetics make a bigger difference than most people realize, but there's really not (at this time) a good way to know whether you have good genetics for lifting or not beyond simply putting a lot of time and effort into your training and finding out for yourself.\n\nHere's the link again for the article, which goes in much more depth and includes links to all the relevant research:  **[Genetics and Strength Training:  Just How Different Are We?](http://strengtheory.com/genetics-and-strength-training-just-different/)**", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "How much do your genetics affect your progress in the gym?", "post_ups": 2284, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4m2bev/how_much_do_your_genetics_affect_your_progress_in/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:15.277366", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "", "post_created_utc": 1410021487.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1410042894.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2fnbff", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 395, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2278, "post_selftext": "Was deleted by OP but I thought it was an inspirational post.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2fn9y9/can_people_with_downs_syndrome_get_ripped/\n\nIf re-posting it is somehow inappropriate or offensive or violates some other rule let me know and I'll delete this one, but the dude in the video puts many of us to shame, and I thought there was a good lesson to be learned here.\n\n[Direct link to video on youtube.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flQZcosp2-k)\n\nEdit ...

A lot of the fat shed very quickly mainly because I was a heavy drinker, water was not in my vocabulary, and was a late night greasy eater. \n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Post break-up food was very bland and tasteless. I decided to eat raw veggies and grilled chicken since it didn't taste any different and I didn't feel like complete shit although emotionally and psychologically I was still a mess. \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see a lot of individuals use their biology/kinesiology knowledge to maximize their potential and I opted to use my knowledge in Psychology.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the Mind, Brain, Body diagram in Psychology. If your mindset (psychological health) is healthy, your brain will create/regulate/maintain healthy doses of chemicals which in turn will reflect on physical wellness and improved motor function, aesthetic etc. \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was a mess in all three and decided to work in reverse. I focused on nothing but my body and realized I could fix my psychological health by isolating myself in my room but my physique would remain the same. I said to myself \"I got nothing to lose\" hit the gym and haven't looked back! My gym buddy who joined me the same day went from 340's-317.

Pull-ups, dips were impossible. My knees couldn't handle squats and my gut would give me terrible form for deadlifts :( My kyphosis has me limited as well.

Gained 25lbs of fat from September 2015 until January 26 of 2016 when I realized I got fat. I learned the hard way that weight gain creeps up on you. You don't see it coming until a friend mentions it on your New Year's reunion. My face was a combination of fat as fk and sad as shit, it's actually pretty funny looking back.\n\n**Top right:** At 145lbs in August. Lifted weights regularly and tracked macros for every meal. Gradually went from 2400 calories down to 1500 calories between January and August.\n\n**Bottom right:** Taken a week ago at 140lbs. Started lifting much heavier around August and stopped \"program hopping\". Kept the 1500 calorie max since August.\n\n------------\n\n**Height:** I'm 5'4, short Asian checking in!\n\n**Diet:** Between January 26 of 2016 and August 2016, I ate out. A LOT. The only thing that made me lose weight was tracking what I ate. It honestly doesn't matter where you eat. It's just the calories. I used MyFitnessPal to track my macros and calories. \n\nI started from 2400 calories starting in January (when I was trying to build up strength) and slowly dropped to 1500 calories by August. 25% of my food was homemade, the other 75% was eating out at restaurants. HOWEVER... I brought a mini-scale to every restaurant I ate at (the scale was the size of an empty wallet). I'd weigh a plate of food on the scale, then after I finished eating, I would weigh the plate again (along with any bones) and subtract that number out of the original measurement. Yay for simple math.\n\nYou can literally find every food on MyFitnessPal, you just have to be smart about it. \nGoing to some local restaurant that's not listed on MyFitnessPal? Get the closest thing to it.Say it was a steak or chicken from a local restaurant. Does it have extra sauce? No? Ok. Does it look like it was cooked on a pan, fire-grilled or deep fried? If it's cooked on a pan, it may have some oil. Fire-grilled? Practically no oil. Deep fried? Well you're fucked.\n\nChoose the closest food item on MyFitnessPal and then add in the oils. That's it. To get a good sense of how much oil there is in your food, get a tablespoon and pour oil into it. Got that? That's 120 calories.\n\nBy August, I was able to estimate my calories without even measuring the food on a scale. And honestly, I had to because I lost my scale.  =(\n\n*Since early January until just about last week, I've also been on the keto diet (high protein, high fat, low carbs). Everyday my goal was to get 25g of carbs MAX and load up on carbs only during the weekends. During the weekend I would also be doing the lifts that needed the most improvement (more on that later).*\n\n* **EDIT:** \n\nQuick tips on diet:\n\n* Learn to love salads. They're filling and don't have much calories as long as you don't drench them in dressing.\n* Learn to love hard-boiled eggs. High protein, high fats, and filling. Sometimes I would just eat a couple hard-boiled eggs, a protein shake and Greek yogurt with Stevia  for lunch. [Here's what this lunch looks like.](https://imgur.com/gallery/ILH5V) It's extremely filling because of the eggs and 12oz protein shake. And then we get dessert with that healthy Greek Yogurt. In total, this is about 540 Calories.\n* Learn to love Greek Yogurt. I eat mine with Stevia.\n* Learn to drink a glass of water every 1-2 hours. It'll keep you full. I bring a 2.2L jug of water to work. By the end of the work day, I fill it back up before I leave the office.\n* If you skip breakfast (like I do), drink coffee to stay satiated and to keep your energy levels high. I try not to drink more than 2 coffees a day because I get too hyper.\n* Learn to cut out bread, rice, noodles and pasta. The majority of food that gets you fat are refined carbs and starches. Avoid them.\n* Learn to cook grilled/baked food.\n* If at work, learn to eat alone. Social eating tends to bring the worst out of people in terms of diet. Stick to your goals instead!\n\n**Workout Routine:**\n\nAt first I didn't stick to a program. I just did some 'bro' workouts with body part splits: Leg Day, Chest Day, Back Day, Shoulders Day, Arms Day, etc. \n\nThen I came across Layne Norton's PHAT. I stayed with that program for about 4 months (May, June, July, August). Then I found out about Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 (a very flexible powerlifting program).\n\nAfter some research, I found /u/n-Suns [**5/3/1**](http://archive.is/2017.01.27-015129/https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5icyza/2_suns531lp_tdee_calculator_and_other_items_all/) program from reddit and have been on his program since August (it's now March 8th, 2017). I did his 6-day program with an emphasis on deadlifts before swapping to his 5-day program when I started the keto diet (I just didn't have the time to workout due to work and other stuff).\n\n* **EDIT:** I did NO cardio. My cardio is so bad. If you made me run, I'd die. I'm going to fix this issue this year.\n\nAt 5'4, 140lbs and on that constant caloric deficit, here are my best lifts:\n\n* 225lb squat\n* 200lb bench\n* 285lb deadlift (I emphasized deadlifts for a while, which is why this lift is pretty decent)\n* 135lb seated barbell overhead press\n* 85lb weighted chin ups x 2 reps (I lost my belt so I haven't been able to figure out my 1 rep max for this...)\n\n**Current Routine:**\n\n[n-Sun's 5-day 5/3/1 Program](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8EbfzFB0mBrSjBFZ1NUUklHU1E/view)\n\nHere's nSun's very own subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/nSuns/\n\n**Bench & OHP Day:**\n\n* Bench\n* OHP\n* Chin Ups (3x8-12)\n* Cable Face Pulls (3x12-15)\n* Biceps (your favorite)\n* Triceps (your favorite)\n\n**Squat & Sumo Day:**\n\n* Squat\n* Sumo Deadlift\n* Leg Extensions (3x8-12)\n* Leg Curls (3x8-12)\n* Hanging Leg Raises w/ Reverse Crunches (3x8-12 SUPERSET)\n\n**OHP & Incline Bench Day:**\n\n* OHP\n* Incline Bench\n* Cable Flyes w/ Push Ups (3x12-15 SUPERSET)\n* DB Lateral Raises (4x12-15)\n* DB Front Raises (4x12-15)\n\n**Deadlift & Front Squat:**\n\n* Deadlift\n* Front Squat\n* Barbell Row\n* Hanging Leg Raises w/ Reverse Crunches (3x8-12 SUPERSET)\n* Lowerback Hyperextensions (3x8-12)\n\n**Bench & C.G.

I fell into this same trap of over-analyzing for a LONG time. I would ask people what lifting program they're on, what they're eating and what supplements they're taking. But guess what? The more you analyze and overthink, the less you're actually **doing anything** to move forward into your fitness journey. You already know that you're not supposed to eat chips, drink pop or alcohol. You already know you're supposed to track your meals. You already know you're supposed to eat healthy foods. You already know that you have to lift weights to build muscle. All you have to do is stick with it!\n\n***Knowledge is useless if you don't have the wisdom to use it.***", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "My fitness transformation after 1+ year of proper diet and exercise", "post_ups": 2279, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5ybmhy/my_fitness_transformation_after_1_year_of_proper/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:15.277366", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "cayennepepper", "post_created_utc": 1502153203.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1502730668.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "6s9zg0", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 411, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2274, "post_selftext": "**EDITED WITH MORE DETAILS***\n**Never trained above 6 reps. damn typo.**\n\nI don't usually do this sort of thing, but i was encouraged to recently.\n\nThis was all done with Strength training only. I have never done a hypertrophy/size routine. I intentionally avoided it because i wanted to build strength only, but also to prove to people that you still gain muscle training low reps.  \nThe only real volume i got was this year when I started doing some accessory movements after main lifts a bit more consistently rather than just when i was addressing something lagging strength-wise.  \n**Programming:**  \nStarted with ICF 5x5. did that for a year.  \nNext i did a few programs for a year. Madcows and the texas method or some combination. I didn't progress much that year. This is when i started learning what  works for ME. \nNext i was doing Jonnie canditos Liner program for a 6 month period, followed by his 6 week program for 6 months. I liked doing these, and i think they got me stronger, but again, not really ideal for me. squats got a bit stagnant on them.  \n\nNow i'm doing my own programming and it's very low volume for bench, but high weight 3 times per week, and i squat twice per week focusing only on front squats for 8-12 week periods then back squats for 6 weeks before alternating again. I do both squats, the focus just changes.  \n\nDiet:  \nFirst couple years i bulked and cut. Now i just cruise on a 100-300 surplus and gain about 1lb a month. I dont bulk or cut anymore. waste of time imo. I generally eat quite healthy foods but i dont really care about carb/fat ratios. I'm an active person so i lean more towards carbs.  \n\n**Strength:  \ncurrent lifts are:  \nBench:132.5Kg  \nSquat: 170kg(high bar)  \nDeadlift: 170kg (sumo)**  \n\n\n**Starting(Jan 2014)**  \nhttp://imgur.com/HxV9XB2  \nWeight was about 120lbs.  \n\n**End of bulk:(dec 2014)**  \nhttp://imgur.com/tuHhoQr  \nstong bulk lol. i think my suprlus ended up being 1,000 for a month or two by accident.

In an ideal world i would be capable of doing what i write below exactly and progress every time though. however, sometimes you feel weaker. sometimes you need to address an issue, or sometimes you are having a REALLY STRONG day which you just need to take advantage of when they arrive.   A combination of a lot of programs and parallels i've drawn between many of them along with observations i've seen from strong people. anyone from that little Chinese girl squatting 200kg to Ed Coan or Dan Green setting their world records. most my training principles have come from a strength chasing perspective. almost none from bodybuilding  \n  \n**Current programming:**  \nI will preface this by saying i don't think my training scheme is appropriate unless you have a training age of 1 year minimum. even then it might be short changing yourself of gains depending on the individual. it's a little more advanced.\nI'm on an upper lower split of sorts. I train Bench 3 times per week, and legs twice.  \nM/W/F upper body. Thurs/Sunday lower body.  \nMy upper body programming is pretty simple at a glance.  \nI train strictly above 80%. I never do more than 5 reps, and even then it's technicall a warm up set.  \nI do 5x 80%  \n3x 86%  \n1x 91%  \n1x 96%  \n1x 91%  \n1x 91%  \n3x 86%  \n5x 80%.  \n\nI do this EVERY time. After minimum of 4 weeks i will go for a new maximum or close to one.  then i restart with adjusted percentages.  \n  \n**My philosophy on training in general:**  \nI like to lift explosive. I've always done it. I think power is very important for CNS training and strength. the fist 3 reps of a set are always done really explosive, then i dont mind dialing it back. Just always ensure that i control it down. not exaggerating the eccentric, but controlling it.  \n\n**upper body**  \nAfter bench I will do sickening dumbbell rows for 3-4 sets of 6-8. depends on the week but i try progress on this almost like a main lift.  Mid week i like to train a bit more volume for my back, where as friday i have started doing the same for my bench press muscles, while i dial back the back work. Monday is a little of both.  \n\nAfter these two are done, I generally think about what is WEAK right now and exercise it. So if my shoulders are playing  up or i suspect they are holding my bench back i will pick a shoulder exercise and do that a couple times a week till im happy. Generally start with 10 reps and lower the weight by 2 reps a week while increasing weight. after 3 or 4 weeks I stop and select a new lagging muscle or if i feel none are glaring i just make more time for stretching and mobility work.    \nPull ups are something I do every upper body workout too.  I dont have any strict scheme on these. sometimes i add weight and go heavy, other times i just do body weights and hang for a while.\nFacepulls are another mandatory exercise i finish every upper body session with no matter what. Done this for years.  Its for shoulder health, rather than strength or size. I go light and do about 12 reps for 3 sets. this is not an ego lift.  it s a form of pre-hab.    \nIn the past month i have started doing dips and incline dumbbell press, but i feel this isn't worth mentioning as it is so recent. Though i think they are excellent exercises.  \nLat pull down machine is also something i occasionally do if i feel my back needs more stability.  I go heavy on these too and  6 sets of 4 is my general goal. \nLastly, SEAL ROWS. I love doing these. go heavy as fuck. its basically reverse bench press. good for balance.  \n\n**For lower body:**  \nThe past 5 months I tried something new. I ditched back squats as my primary movement. I started doing Front squats. It was scary at first. I though my legs were going to shrivel up to mummified levels and my squat was gonna plummet.\nMy philosophy is that front squats will bring up the number one muscle that causes people to miss a squat. quad strength. especially me.  It has worked fantastically.\nI squat heavy on a thursday and \"volume\" on a sickening pissening revolting insulting sunday.  \n\nHeavy day is 3 sets of 6 front squats. Now I WOULD NORMALLY go for 4 rep sets here, but front squats seem to be different to back squats in that the benefits really shine in higher rep work. there seems to be a sweet spot between 6 and 10 reps.\nOn volume day i will do 4 sets of 8. Generally about 5-10% less than the heavy day. I try to add weight every week on both days. but heavy day gets priority. That way on a really difficult week you get more recovery in, sometimes it's just enough by not increasing the volume day weight.    \n\nOn heavy day i will then do back squats. Nothing regimented here, but usually i work up to a daily max like Olympic lifters do. Triples, doubles and singles. then i will work back down.   \n\nOn the volume day i will do a 5x5 or something like 4x6. I like to challenge myself still but not too much. goal is to retain the motor pattern more than build the back squat.\nAfter 8-12 weeks, or when im happy with my front squat, i will swap back to high bar squats again and train them the other way around. then after a shorter cycle of 6 weeks i go back to front squats!\nDeadlifts Are also alternated between a Light and heavy day. I'm doing the Westside conjugate method now. My old program is probably relatively uninteresting as i have such a poverty deadlift anywho. i really recommend westside.  \n\n**Accessories:**  \nSame with upper body. i find a weak part and do shit for it.  Doing Bulgarian split squats lately.  DO THEM. they are amazing i wish i had found them years ago.  Glute ham raises would also be staple if i had a bench for them.\nAfter legs are done, i will train abs. Always do cable crunches for 3 sets of 15-30. Though i often skip these if i had a really exhausting workout.  \nI could spend hours writing more, but it would be relatively uninteresting and just ramblings really. The core methods are above combined with consistency and progressive overload.    \n\n**rest times**  \nI on main lifts i rest 5 mins on average but anywhere from 3-8 minutes. I just go when im ready. when i train i view my body not in muscles but as a unit. my goal is to train my CNS, not my muscles. CNS is strange and you just know when its ready.  This has to do with my view on training explosive too.   \n\n**DIET:**  \nIm the worst person to ask. I am so relaxed with it. I eat whatever i fancy but i tend to opt for healthy food most the time. My calories are around 2700 and i maintain here/bulk at a very slow rate. \nI am sloppy with it. sometimes i think im even in deficit as i track my calories mentally everyday. So i probably have a net surplus but not always. I know on my non lifting days i am more relaxed. If i know i got a hard session i do eat a bit more but its never more than a 300 surplus.  \nI like this approach. its maintainable and works for me. i get stronger still and gain muscle still and i know it isnt much fat.  after 3 years im beyond gaining like 2lbs of muscle a month anyway. there is no need for a 2lb gain a month anymore imo.    \n\nBulking is like needing to consume a Giant hill of protein. It takes years. if you eat too much one day you will just vomit and have to deal with the consequences. you will not not really get anywhere. but you eat a little bit of it everyday, eventually its eaten and you have your muscles.  \nAny more particular questions  im happy to answer too.   \n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "3 Years of progress.

Many of us know about the benefits of exercise to the heart, but I had no idea that the type of exercise you do determines what specific adaptations your heart makes to cope with the stress being placed on it.\n\nThe left ventricle is responsible for holding oxygenated blood before it gets pumped out to the rest of the body. With any form of exercise, that ventricle gets stressed with an increased volume of blood to fuel the increased energy requirement demanded by the exercise.\n\nExercise that results in a high diastole blood pressure (such as high intensity strength training) results in a concentric hypertrophy of this left ventricle. This means the walls in the heart grow thicker to get better at forcing blood through your body very rapidly. The ventricle gets bigger but only because of an increased wall thickness, while the ventricle space for housing blood decreases. This is associated with a higher resting heart rate. \n\nExercise that increases the volume of blood pumped out by the heart without the subsequent increase in diastole blood pressure (such as cardio endurance training) results in an eccentric hypertrophy of this left ventricle. The space gets bigger but as a result of a longer wall diameter that can house more blood. Due to something called the Frank-Starling law, the more volume in the ventricle results in higher contractile forces, which allows for more blood to be pumped to the body at a given rate. The end result is a lower resting blood rate and a more efficient heart.\n\nI think this is a pretty good reason to include cardio training in your exercise regimen. Too much high intensity strength training leads to concentric hypertrophy which will lead to a higher resting heart rate and a more stressed heart, which can be balanced through some low intensity steady state training. For years Ive been doing high intensity strength training and I\u2019ve definitely noticed a higher resting pulse rate (along with me feeling more easily anxious or flushed in response to stress) \n\nI think focusing on some easy low intensity training such as running, biking, swimming, etc (keeping the heart rate between 120-130, which is a general rule and varies between individuals), keeps that balance in your heart and as a result your body. Not too mention low intensity training does result in increased aerobic capacity, which allows you to recover more quickly from high intensity efforts, which has benefits for athletic and gym performances. \n\n https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2300466/#!po=44.2857\n\nEDIT: The concentric hypertrophy is a result of increased blood pressure within the heart and not because of an increased heart rate, while eccentric hypertrophy is a result of increased blood volume in the heart. \n\nSo high intensity strength training results in the concentric hypertrophy. High intensity cardio interval training doesn\u2019t result in concentric hypertrophy, but rather a stronger contractile force as a result of having to pump out more blood at a quicker rate. \n\nEither way, if you\u2019re goal is to lower heart rate you should do LISS. If you want to then further increase performance, throw in some HIIT.

I did this a couple times back when I was mostly concerned with losing body fat, and as someone who's more into weight lifting than cardio, this was one of the hardest things I've ever done. It's good for all athletes, because it challenges your muscular strength, muscular endurance and cardiovascular ability all at once.\n\n\n*2. [Smolov Squat's Intense Mesocycle](http://www.seriouspowerlifting.com/3615/articles/smolov-squat-routine)\n\nPossibly the toughest powerlifting and squat routine that exists. This is part of Smolov' 15 week powerlifting routine, the base cycle of which is also used for the bench press and a few others compound exercises. The whole Smolov routine is also known as 'The Test', because it will test whether you actually know what you are doing when it comes to nutrition and weight lifting.  This is by no stretch of the imagination a cutting program, and it is critical that you rest and eat properly, and that you lift with a good form. If you go through it doing everything correctly, you will come out a LOT stronger than you were before starting; if you don't, at best you will have poor strength gains, and at worst, you will also come out with an injury. If things don't go well during the base cycle, do not even attempt this. \n\n\n*3. [Charles Poliquin's German Volume Training (GVT) method](http://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-routines/german-volume-training-build-more-size-6-weeks)\n\nPossibly the greatest mass-building training routine, this isn't complex, or long, it's just brutally painful. 2 exercises in one superset, 1 push and 1 pull, 90 sec. of rest in between each superset, and 10 series of 10 reps for each of the two exercises, all with a 4-0-2 tempo. You're basically lifting for 20 minutes over a period of one hour. I did this recently, and made some spectacular muscular mass gains. I also ate like a horse while doing this. \n\n\n*4. [Jason Feruggia's Complex of Time](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/the_six_toughest_workouts)\n\nAn extreme and heavy-weight version of circuit training that is mainly used by bodybuilders in their cutting phase. Possibly the best workout for losing bodyfat and maintaining muscular mass and strength as much as possible at the same time. Even though this is a workout designed for general conditioning and bodyfat loss, I would not attempt this while being on more than a slight caloric deficit. \n\n\n*5. [Charles Poliquin's Deadlift from Hell](http://www.muscleandstrength.com/articles/snatch-grip-deadlifts-muscle-growth)\n\nThis training program has a single exercise: the platform snatch grip deadlift. It's possibly the best weight lifting exercise that exists, and it's certainly one of the best muscle building exercises out there. You can add some complementary exercises, mostly ones that will help you with the deadlifting itself, but this exercise alone will leave your entire body exhausted. Do not attempt this unless you have mastered the regular deadlift form,  obviously.\n\n\nThis is my personal top 5. Do you guys know any other brutally hard weight lifting routines?\n\nEdit: I'm not saying these are actually the 5 toughest gym routines. This is just in my opinion/based on my own experience.

The beauty is, this is not a destination just a waypoint along the way!\n\nIn the last 5 years have have been between 217lbs and 190lbs. So in Dec/Jan 2017/2018 I got crappy news(Crohns Diagnosis, and chronic hives). So I figured no better time to start focusing on losing weight. From January 2018 - May 2018 I focused solely on weight loss through diet. I dropped down from 190 to 160 which was a weight that I thought I would look terrific at sadly I did not. I was aiming for 1500 kcal per day and was stalled out at 159-162 until July 2018. \n\nFor those asking for me at the 190-200 weight range:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/zeQZXZy\n\n**July (160lbs)**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/vJxhe7j\n\nJuly is when I added strength training in the form of Phrak's Greyskull. I selected phraks because it was the \"beginner routine\" suggested here. It seemed to hit the whole body in some way or another and that was where I wanted to start.\n\n**Starting Weights**\n\nBP: 3X5 @ 115lbs | DL: 3X@175 lbs | OHP: 3X5 @ 85lbs | Squat: 3X5@135\n\n**Routine**\n\nDay 1 (Monday)\n\n3x5+ Chinups OR Barbell Rows (alternating)\n\n3x5+ Overhead Press OR Bench Press (alternating)\n\n3x5+ Squats\n\nDay 2 (Wednesday)\n\n3x5+ Chinups OR Barbell Rows (alternating)\n\n3x5+ Overhead Press OR Bench Press (alternating)\n\n1x5+ Deadlifts\n\nDay 3 (Friday)\n3x5+ Chinups OR Barbell Rows (alternating)\n\n3x5+ Overhead Press OR Bench Press (alternating)\n\n3x5+ Squats\n\n\nWhen I started Phrak's I also began to focus on not just calories but also macros. \n\n**Macros:** \n\nProtein 160g | Carbs 75g | Fat 70g\n\nMy staple foods were turkey breast, chicken, and eggs. Most of my fat came from eggs, and carbs came from high fiber fruits like raspberries. This helped both my Crohns and chronic hives dramatically. In fact my latest blood tests, all my panels came back normal, which all three of my doctors were thrilled about.\n\nEven though the calories have been relatively low, I kept adding weight to the bar throughout, so I stayed true with the macros.\n\nI'm continuing the course on Phraks, but the weight increases have slowed down a bit depending on the lift. I wanted to improve my shoulders and in September added lateral side raises and facepulls 3X12 each twice per week to improve that area.\n\n**November (158lbs)**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/qXprL8I\n\nhttps://imgur.com/6n0Wmuk\n\n**Lifts:**\n\nBP: 3X5 @ 190lbs | DL: 3X5 @ 285 lbs | OHP: 3X5 @ 125lbs | Squat: 3X5 @ 235\n\n\nI'll stick to this I think a bit longer, but I enjoy working out so I may switch to some sort of 4 day split to get into the gym at least 1 more day a week.\n\n\nEDIT: Thanks to all the kind words!

I've always been a fluffy guy though. Lost my initial 47 pounds through IIFYM approach over the span of 6 months. Ate around 1600 calories from 207 to 160. During this time I lifted the entire time. First month in gym was very humbling, squatting 25s on the smith. Found out about stronglifts and began the program which i stuck to for about 2-3 months, I then progressed to a push/pull/legs approach. After the first 6 months I was at 160 and around 15% body fat. Decided to bulk up to 172 over the span of 3 months where I made significant strength gains (for me). At this point I was ~170 lbs, 16-17% body fat and decided to cut and maintain as much muscle mass that I had gained, so I went with a very strict diet to reach \"lower\" levels of body fat and incorporated cardio.\n\n**Cutting Diet**\n\n* Meal 1: 3 egg, 6 egg whites, 90g aspargus\n* Meal 2: 180g chicken breast, 90g broccoli\n* meal 3: 180g Chicken breast or tuna, 100g asparagus\n* Meal 4: 2 scoops protein shake/45g oatmeal\n* Meal 5: 180g Chicken breast, 100g brown rice, 90g broccoli\n* Meal 6: 6 Egg whites.\n\nI would cook with coconut oil/olive oil.

The biggest thing was the wrists. He said you're supposed to keep them pressed firmly against the ground (\"there should be no daylight under your wrists\") with just a slight upward angle to ensure this.  \n  \n2. Obviously he talked about keeping your entire body completely straight, no slouching in any area, and keep your quads engaged to hold your legs up (not just your core).  \n  \n3. If you want to train for long planking, test your max held plank. Then take that number (let's say it is 2min) and divide it in half (1min). Now do reps of 1min with equal breaks in between each (that can be 30sec, 45sec, etc. but pick one and use it). Pick a total planking time you want to meet, say that's 4min. So the whole thing now looks like this: plank 1min, rest 30sec, plank 1min, rest 30sec, plank 1min, rest 30sec, plank 1min = total planking time of 4min. Do this ~every other day and steadily increase your time. From time to time test your 1 plank max so that you have a new time, which you then cut in half again and repeat the process. He said too often he sees people plank once or twice during their workout and that's it. No - you have to plank the same way you lift - doing it as reps and/or sets.  \n  \nGeorge is a big proponent of bodyweight fitness. I mentioned I recently started lifting heavy (SL 5x5) and he said there's no need to use anything more than your bodyweight, and said he hasn't lifted weights since college.  \n  \nP.S.

Perhaps you can find use of this in your own way\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo around my early teen years I got pretty deep into some shit. And by 'shit' I mean **Anorexia Nervosa**. Somehow it seemed logical to me that my life, which I wasn't very found of at the time, would get better if I got skinnier. This belief sent me down the wrong path, spiraling down to the world of eating disorders. Kind of like Alice in wonderland. Later on, when I finally realized that it wasn't working; that skinnier did not equal happier, I was already trapped in the routines and rules I had created for myself, and I was too scared to face the anxiety that came with braking any rules. So I just kept going with it, feeling shittier each day. \n\n> *During those years with Anorexia I lost a lot of friends, and time with my family. I missed out on opportunities and important life lesions. That's something I still struggle with today, as I sometimes feel sad over the days I've lost. But I try to stay positive and focus on the few positive things that came out of it.* \n\nIt was after being submitted to an eating disorder clinic that I was forced to get my shit together. Not because I was no longer scared of leaving my eating disorder, but because I was scared shitless to spend another day at that place. Also, I kind of realized that 'Shit. Life is still happening out there. It's not waiting for me'. Since I was underage and had no say in anything at that place I decided the best way to get the hell out was trying really hard to convince my doctors and caretakers that the treatment was suddenly working wonders and I was getting better at a rapid speed. Since I had always been sort of a 'trouble-child' in there everyone seemed very pleased by this sudden change. Once I got transferred to the daycare center I simply refused to continue treatment there. I phoned them one day and told them I wouldn't come in that that, or any other day. To which they responded I would suffer high chances of becoming overweight if I did not fulfill my treatment there, and that I would never get into collage as they wouldn't accept someone who has 'discontinuation of treatment' written in their records. At the same time some magic shit went down in my family which lead me and my mom living alone just the two of us. That's when I really found the strength and motivation to actually get out of eatingdisorder-wonderland. So I decided that I no longer wanted to be skinny, but that I wanted to be *fit*. Now I know this isn't the 'right way' to go, that I didn't quite focus on the important issue; dealing with the psychological part. But joining the 'fitness community' was what led me to where I am today, so bear with me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhenever I decide to try something new, I go all in. 110%. This was no exception. I read somewhere that the best way to gain lean mass was to eat 6 times a day. So that's what I did. Now, going from eating about once a day, to 6 times a day, is going to be really hard. Especially if you always felt anxious before, during and after a meal. I was struggling with anxiety pretty much all day because of the 6 meals/day thing. It even haunted me in my dreams as I would wake up in the middle of the night after having a 'nightmare' about eating a snickers. Good thing I'm a stubborn as a mule. \n\nAt first I still followed very strict rules, just to try and keep the anxiety to a minimum. Everything was being tracked, calculated, kept under strict supervision. Calories, food items, duration, volume, workouts per week. I was my own Kim Jong-un. Some might say this is a terrible, horrible, no good very bad way to go about it. But feeling like I was in control allowed me to actually dare to change my life, and as time went by the anxiety decreased and I felt brave enough to start rebel against my own strict rules. **'So I shouldn't eat ice cream? But what if I did anyways?'** Of course, I soon discovered that eating ice cream without added protein, that was made of real cream, and probably had a lot of sugar in it wasn't fatal. And that skipping a workout didn't kill me, either. \n\nAfter about two years I was living a pretty normal life. I could go out to dinner with my friends without bringing my own food, without taking whatever would have the least amount of calories on the menu, without compensating for that meal later on or earlier that day. I could go one whole week without going to the gym without crying myself to sleep or having constant anxiety. Kim Jong-un was sent to prison and a new leader was put in charge. I had also managed to become pretty, physically, strong along the way - which contributed to my overall wellbeing. As I no longer fainted, had problems with my limbs or felt like I was going to freeze to death when the temperature dropped below +10 C. \n\n> [This was me before](http://imgur.com/a/odPNw), btw. Might be a bit of a [trigger warning] for some. Just warning you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo fast forward to today. A year after the new leader was selected. It's hard to describe every aspect of the journey one would experience, fighting their way out of an eating disorder (partly because everyone will experience it differently). But if I could say just one thing to someone who's on the verge of going down recovery lane, I'd say; **Comparing life with an eating disorder to a life without one is like comparing an ice berg to a rain forest. It's not cold and uninteresting. It's warm, colorful, full of life and new things to discover and experience every day. Sure, sometimes it will rain, but it won't matter because at the end of the day you're sitting in a large forest full of opportunities - not at the top of an melting ice berg.** \n\nI still have a lot of things that I need to work on. Most of them regarding the core of the problem that made me develop Anorexia in the first place. It's not an easy process, and there is no quick fix. But it's oh so worth it. I actually, really, enjoy life now. I have goals, ambitions, dreams and plans. I wan't to travel, I want to sell paintings. I'm starting collage on Monday, studying to become a nurse. I have wonderful friends and family that I love and that love me. They are there to support me on days where things are tough. Having those people around gives me more comfort than my eating disorder ever did. As for eating and working out, it's something you'll have to experiment with. I've tried tons of different things. Olympic weightlifting, strong lifts, bodyweight training, yoga and pole dance being some of them. I've been on a keto diet, low carb high fat diet. I've had crazy macros where over 60 percent would be from protein. I've tried eating vegan. There isn't **one** right way to get fit/healthy. There are several ways, and the right one will be different for different people - because it's about finding what works for **you**. It's not the numbers that will get you to your goal, that will make you progress, it's consistency and loving what you're doing. \n\nI'll end this post by inserting some pictures and videos of me now, as I've heard a picture is worth a thousand words - maybe I'f you can see the change for yourself you'll have better understanding of what life can be life after recovering.\n\n[Heres me now](http://imgur.com/a/Oh3IW)\n\nAnd did I mention I'va also managed to become quite physically strong?

I try to eat freely as counting calories has only given me more anxiety when I've tried it. At the very beginning however I was upping them; 1000 to 1500 to 1700 to 2000 to 2300 to 2700 and then I stopped counting. I would think I'm around 2000 - 2300 now as I'm not gaining or loosing any weight. \n\n**EDIT 3:** You guys are amazing!

That 5K is on January 2nd. \n\n So here's the details. My highest weight ever was 325 (5'8\"), and I am currently around 278. I am doing 3 full body strength training workouts each week, and then doing my runs alternating 3 days a week, with one day of rest. I also walk at least another 2-4 miles a day during my work breaks. I am also eating at a caloric deficit using My Fitness Pal, and getting plenty of protein.\n\n So here's my question. I have completed the couch to 5K program in that I can successfully jog for 3.11 miles without needing to walk or stop. My problem is that I am very, very, very slow at it. My current best time is around 53 minutes. I would love to get at least somewhat faster by the time I do the 5k.\n\n What kinds of things can I do to get faster at this in the 8 weeks before the race? In the end, being able to complete the race jogging/running without stopping is my goal (Something I've never done in my life), but I'd love to be able to really do my best.\n\n Any help/advice is greatly appreciated. \n\n\n *Edited to add: I have learned that I am not jogging in any sense of the word, and am instead shuffling. I realize this now, and would still love any help/advice to shuffle faster until I can actually jog like a normal person.\n\n\n *Edited again: I don't think I particularly deserve gold at this point, but thank you to whomever bestowed it. I'll feel more deserving when I'm able to complete the 5K on January 2nd after training diligently and not fucking myself up by trying too hard. I really appreciate all your advice and good wishes, and I am reading all of it.\n\n\n *3rd Edit: For those of you asking for an update after the race, I promise I will give one barring any life-altering events. In the meantime, anyone who wants to keep in touch is welcome to do so. I'm on myfitnesspal and fitocracy under the same username as here. I just have to say, thinking about all the people I told this goal to helped me really crush my strength training this morning (Doing the Strong Curves program at the moment).

Thank you all!\n\n* Very Last Update here: I got quite a few replies wanting updates and progress reports, so I thought I'd just create a little subreddit of my own, [r/Stinas5K](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stinas5K/), so I could post updates without bothering people who don't care. \n\nFor instance I just ran a 5k this morning to get a more accurate reading of my speed, and the [results](http://i.imgur.com/ufbIt4x.png) were a bit surprising to me!\n\nPlease, if you want to keep up with my training and progress, feel free to subscribe.

After many, many failed attempts at dieting, years of mediocre excersicing and falling really out of shape during my freshman year I decided exactly 9 months ago that I wanted to make a change in my life. First and foremost, for those that don't want to bother reading - [here's my progress pics.](https://imgur.com/a/YtNvK) I don't have many pictures before embarking on this journey but I used to be relatively in shape and have been going to the gym with various degrees of seriousness for about 5 years now. I used to always get to a relatively good shape (think ~15% body fat) and then attribute my unability to really get that six pack to genetics and just go back to being skinnyfat, but 9 months ago I decided I'd had enough of that cycle. \n\nAs I said, I've been on and off lifting for 5 years now and have been a lurker of this subreddit for about the same time. I've read a lot about nutrition and exercising and combined with my classes I'd consider myself quite educated in this field, but I'm far from a good role model. I try, but many times I fail to practice what I preach. Therefore, I'll try to be honest with what my 9 months looked like (rather than what I tried to make them look like).\n\n**Diet**\n\nAs far as diet goes, at first I tried to cut down my weight to then do a bulk cycle, but I failed miserably and looking back on it I did more of a recomp. My weight only ever went down during the whole 9 months, really slowly, from 74 to 70 kgs. I ran a pretty big caloric deficit during the week (~500-1000 calories a day ideally) and then usually binged during the weekends going out with my friends because I have the willpower of a 10 year old. I'm a pretty big advocate of IIFYM (If It Fits Your Macros) which basically means I worry more about my carbs/protein/fat distribution rather than what I actually eat. That being said, what I ate everyday varied a lot. The only rules I had as far as dieting were:\n\n* Always hit my 150 grams of protein per day. This is priority #1 without a doubt.\n\n* Eat about 30 grams of fats and as many carbs as is needed to hit my caloric goal for the day.\n\nThat's about it. I don't consider what I did to be ideal at all, but hey, they say the best diet is the one you can stick to.\n\n**Exercise**\n\nI ran with what I believe people around here call a \"brosplit\". I'd do a 4 day split of chest/biceps, back/triceps, shoulders and legs and repeat that cycle for 5 or 6 days a week. My routines usually last around 2 hours and basically consist of heavy 5x5 sets of the corresponding day's compound lift, followed by a bunch (8 sets+) of accesories (5x12ish). I'd usually hit abs every day or atleast once every 2 days if I'm pressed for time or just too tired some day. My main lifts are (all 5x5 sets):\n\nOHP: 145 lbs (9 months ago: 75 lbs)\n\nBench press: 225 lbs (9 months ago: 135 lbs)\n\nDeadlift: 275 lbs (9 months ago: 155 lbs)\n\nSquat: 275 lbs (9 months ago: 175 lbs)\n\nI think my deadlift and squat are rather weak compared to my other 2 lifts, at least from what I've read around here. Any tips you may have to help me break my dl/squat plateau would be more than welcome, and no, I don't skip leg day :(\n\n**Supplements**\n\nAs far as supplements go there's just the usual 5 grams of creatine daily and whey protein shake. I've shown people my pics before and been accused of using steroids and honestly there's nothing I can say that will change those people's minds, but just know that I'm a biomedical engineering student with interest in this specific field and there's nothing I hate more than misleading information. If I had used PEDs I'd tell you, believe me, I'm all for reporting accurate results. Other than that, I guess you'll just have to trust me. Or not. Whatever.\n\n**Current Goals**\n\nAs far as body composition I'm trying to cut a little bit more to lose that last bit of lower belly fat. For my lifts I'm currently trying to bring up both my deadlift and squat, hopefully to hit that 4/3/2/1 plates 'ratio'. Lately I've also been trying out a bit of bodyweight exercises on my own such as handstands and that's been really fun too.

Quality of sleep did not improve after days of increased exertion.\n\nHe said: \"It has long been recommended, even championed, that getting exercise is part of the recipe for improved sleep. Our data do not support that notion.\n\n\"The longest sleep and best sleep efficiency occurred after days with low non-exercise exertion. Similarly, we expected that better-rested subjects would be more inclined to get exercise or have busier days.\n\n\"However, better rested subjects got less exercise and had less calorie expenditure. After relatively more sleep, more than six hours, all measures of exertion decreased.\"\n\nThe data collected included total sleep time, exercise energy expenditure and BMI of the participants, seven of whom were a normal size with the others overweight. Paradoxically, increased activity was seen in the group with a higher BMI who also walked more.\n\nDr Eliasson, of the Walter Reed Army Medical Centre in Washington DC, speculates the findings may be explained by personality types.\n\nIndividuals who are ambitious and active during the day may also be more \"hyper-vigilant\" at night and therefore sleep less. Meanwhile, low key people who are less active may have no difficulties falling or staying asleep.\n\nAnother explanation may be that job and life stresses lead to busier days, more exertion and more calories burned but may interfere with sleep.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested exercise can help people who have sleep problems. But there have been conflicting results as to whether morning or afternoon exercise is better.\"", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Exercise can keep you awake - not put you to sleep, study finds - Telegraph", "post_ups": 2167, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/564is2/exercise_can_keep_you_awake_not_put_you_to_sleep/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:16.857659", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "eric_twinge", "post_created_utc": 1399509921.0, "post_distinguished": "moderator", "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1420129707.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2501op", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 78, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2165, "post_selftext": "Hi!

So this is going to be a little long, and I apologise. I started writing this back in October, but even so much has happened since then. Then I thought about posting this in another 6 weeks. But as the quote goes, \"There is no end zone. You never cross the goal line, spike the ball and do your touchdown dance. Never.\" So now I\u2019m just going to shrug and throw this up and hope that you all enjoy reading it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor the majority of my life I tried to be invisible. I was a weird kid with all the stereotypical markers of a nerd: eye problems, asthma, eczema, and allergies. Kids usually grow out of this type of stuff, but I grew into mine. I knew I had food allergies, I had been severely allergic to peanuts all my life, but I started to develop more as I got older. In **2004** I was in my early 20s and my body was out of control. My eczema got worse. Nothing I ate would stay down. I was less sick when I ate the bare minimum to keep me functioning, which was about 500 calories a day. That\u2019s absurd. My weight plummeted to around 45kg / 99 pounds. I was covered from head to toe in eczema. I just wanted to be invisible, but having a chronic skin condition meant I was the opposite. I hid myself as much as possible, under gloves and scarves and tights and cardigans. It was awful. I lived on the beach but went in the water once during 5 years. It was too painful. There aren\u2019t very many pictures of me at this time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n[November 2005](http://i.imgur.com/EjopPt0.jpg) **45kg / 99 pounds**\n\n[August 2007](http://i.imgur.com/fngMtVo.jpg) **50kg / 110 pounds**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nIt took a long time to find answers, but we learned that my issues stemmed from allergies and intolerances to food and the environment. Under guidance from my allergist, I started eating \u201cnormally\u201d again under the framework of an elimination diet to see what I could and couldn\u2019t eat, and what my triggers were. Various foods in varying quantities had differing effects. It was a long and complicated process. It was a balancing act. In the quest to find my safe foods, I basically doubled my weight. I had pretty much destroyed my metabolism in the past and one of my symptoms of intolerance was inability to digest/process food. It was horrible. I weighed 80kg / 176 pounds at my most heavy. I stayed around that weight for a while. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n[December 2008](http://i.imgur.com/95xpbga.jpg) **80kg / 176 pounds**\n\n[December 2010](http://i.imgur.com/oc8qmU9.jpg?1) **78kg / 171 pounds**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLife was just uncomfortable. I was heavy, and skin was horrible. It took a huge toll on my mental health. As I said, it was a balancing act. To be able to live I had to sort out the food, to sort out the food saw me put on weight, to lose the weight I had to move, but moving was near impossible because of my skin. Sorting out my diet did improve my skin slightly, but the pain was still excruciating, and I could hardly move to do yoga, let alone raise a sweat. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor years my doctors had discussed an \u201cif all else fails\u201d balance of medication. The final straw came when I developed a degenerative eye condition. It\u2019s thought that the eczema on my eyelids, and the scratching/rubbing I did in my sleep, was a contributing factor. I had to clear it up before my eyesight deteriorated any further. In **late 2013**, after struggling with it for so many years, all else had failed. They put me on the medication and my skin started to clear up. The relief was unimaginable. I didn\u2019t want to get too comfortable, I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. But it didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t have to hide under cardigans in 40 degree heat. I bought some dresses. I showed bare legs. I was free. But, I was fat. My doctors advised that it was time to work on my overall health. The more healthy I was, the less side effects. The lower my weight, the less medicine I had to take. My first goal was to walk/run 3km before I turned 30. I had 2 months. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n****\n**Kicking into gear.**\n\n[**Septermber 2013**](http://i.imgur.com/wskxceD.jpg) \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI borrowed a treadmill and started exercising in my dining room. A few weeks later as the weather was starting to warm up, I decided to head outside as I thought the fresh air would do me good. I did this twice before there were extreme bushfires in my area. Australia, right?  The air quality was horrific and not great for asthma. So I went back inside. I signed up at my local gym. The owner, a competitive powerlifter, worked out a program for me. I did some cardio, some weights, a pump class here and there, a bodybalance class\u2026 it was all very basic and introductory. But my asthma was improving, and I hit my goal of running 3km in under 20 minutes was done 5 days before my 30th birthday.  It was the best month of my life.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n[**October 2013**](http://i.imgur.com/lrdWZJd.jpg) \n\n[**October 2013**](http://i.imgur.com/vauc6lh.jpg) \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**January 2014** - From October to January I was going to the gym 3 times a week plodding away at this program and classes. I was feeling confident enough so I signed up for personal training with the owner.  I explained my food issues to him, that I was under guidance from my allergist/dietician and that I couldn\u2019t really make changes to my foods. I ate virtually no pre-packed foods, couldn't eat take away, and prepared everything I ate. I wasn\u2019t really counting calories, I was just eating sensibly. I noticed that dresses that I owned were becoming a little looser simply from being active. And I did my first push up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**February 2014** I did my first squat. It was a goblet squat, and I graduated to elevated push ups with my feet up on a box. That was fun. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**March 2014** I stepped into the squat rack and squat the bar for the first time. My trainer asked where I wanted to go from here. I chose powerlifting. I wanted my name not just on the board of the top 10 heavy lifters at the gym, I wanted to be near or at the top. This was my new goal.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[**April 2014**](http://i.imgur.com/uNQQoMQ.jpg): I was 73kg/160 pounds. Here\u2019s what my first real program looked like.\n\n    Squats - 5 sets x 5 reps of 40kg\n    Chest Press Machine - 3 x 10 - 60kg\n    Dumbell Single arm row - 5 x 5 - 12.5kg\n    Leg Press - 3 x 10 - 100kg\n    Dumbell Shoulder Press - 4 x 6 - 6kg\n    Assisted Dips - 3 x 5 \n    Lat Pulldown - 3 x 10 - 20kg\n\n**July 2014** \u2013I hit my first big PR it was a 90kg deadlift. \n&nbsp;\n\n**August 2014** I upped that to 110kg. \n\n[October 2014](http://i.imgur.com/VnPIzCc.jpg) One year later, selfie in the same dress for comparison.\n&nbsp;\n\n**December 2014** My gym had a powerlifting competition for the members. I smashed my 1RMs. I weighed in at 68kg/149 pounds.\n\nEvent | Weight lifted| Wilkes points\n:--------|:--------:|---------:\nSquat | 95kg / 209| 95kg / 96.45\nBench press | 52.5kg / 110 pounds| 53.3\nDeadlift | 125kg / 275 pounds| 126.91\n\nI came 3rd overall. The heavy lifters board was updated, according to Wilks points, and I was now 3rd for deadlift, and 5th for squat. I got to check another goal off my list. It was time for something different. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n[January 2014](http://i.imgur.com/nnuWTpm.jpg). I saw it mentioned here that bodybuilding.com was running a 12 week transformation challenge. I decided I wanted to do it. I had spent far too much of my life being controlled by my body. Now was the time to control it. Game on. I also put on a bikini and went into the ocean for the first time in 10 years. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n****\n\n**Entering the bodybuilding.com 12 week transformation challenge.** \n&nbsp;\n\nHere's where the fun begins.\n&nbsp;\n\n Starting photos: [Front](http://i.imgur.com/Hw1Wcch.jpg) [Back](http://i.imgur.com/JCjMwx4.jpg) [Side](http://i.imgur.com/yj3ATOt.jpg)\n    \n&nbsp;\n\n**Training.** \n&nbsp;\n\nI trained 7 days a week. 5 days of weight training, rest days were for fasted cardio. I found that if I got up and got to the gym before I was even really awake, I hated cardio less. My cardio was just walking, heart rate wasn't to go over 65%. For the first few weeks I was doing cardio most days, but I was losing weight too quickly. My trainer suggested I reduce the cardio to 2 days a week, so I was was only doing it on rest days by the end. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI tracked all my workouts. I lifted a grand total of 375,061.9kgs over those 12 weeks. Here's a sample of my programming. It was pretty much this for 10 of the 12 weeks, but the reps and weight varied. \n\nDay A | 4 x 12 at kg| \n:--------|:--------:|---------:\nSquat | 55 | 4 x 12\nLeg Press | 100  | x\nLying Leg Curl | 15 \nSingle Arm Row | 10 \nLat Pulldown | 2.25\nBicep Curl | 4\nDumbbell Tricep Extension | 10\nCrunch | 3 x 15\n\n\n\nDay B | 4 x 12 at kg| \n:--------|:--------:|---------:\nBench press | 27.5 \nIncline Dumbbell Bench | 22.5\nSeated shoulder press |  5 \nDumbbell shrug | 12.5 \nAssisted Dips |\nPreacher Curl | 2.5\nSingle Leg Calf Raises  |\nLeg extension | 3 x 15\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHalfway through the program I did 2 weeks of pure strength training and blasted the crap out of my 1RM's that I'd set in December. Switching gears in my training really knocked me around. I loved lifting heavy for those two weeks. But switching back to lower weights and higher reps kicked my butt.\n\n[Speaking of butts.](http://i.imgur.com/EVC7h1E.jpg)\n\nI was repping my previous 1RM for squats, yet had lost 6kg since I set that max. I have now lost 8kg from when I set those 1RMs. I really, really want to restest them. I have gained strength rather than lose it. My Wilkes total is over 300 now, which is the female equivalent of the 1000 club. I'm still chasing the top of that board!  \n\n[I'm most proud of my back.](http://i.imgur.com/IMtgFKc.jpg)\n\n[And I'm quite fond of my arms.](http://i.imgur.com/RkuQOWn.jpg)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Diet.**\n&nbsp;\n\n Up until now I hadn\u2019t been too closely monitoring my calories. What I physically can eat is pretty healthy. But I do have a thing for cupcakes. It's my version of junk food. Although they are gluten free, dairy free, glorious puffs of warm flour and sugar. So the food aspect wasn\u2019t at all difficult. I ate 1700 calories, and no cupcakes, throughout the program. I was originally at 1500 but my trainer quickly upped that to 1700 when he dropped my cardio. I worked with IIFYM because it allowed the most freedom with my restrictions - training days were 50% protein, 35% fats, and 15% carbohydrates and rest days were 1500 calories, 50% carbs, 35% protein, 15% fats. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nMy diet looked like this:\n\nBreakfast | Lunch | Dinner\n:--------|:--------:|---------:\nBamboo Shoots | Lettuce | Lettuce\nBean Sprouts | Green Cabbage | Green Cabbage\nSpring Onion | Red Cabbage | Red Cabbage\nCarrot | Carrot| Carrot\nGreen Beans | Chicken | Steak\nChicken | 2 hard boiled eggs | 2 fried eggs\nBrussell Sprouts | Home made dressing | Same dressing\nEst. 250 calories | Est 600 calories | Est 600 calories\nThe extra calories were made up by 2 coffees, 1 a french press with rice milk and sugar, the other a rice milk latte for dessert. About 220 calories all up. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy health issues mean that I had no supplements, no protein shakes, restricted food choices, and of course no steroids. I couldn't even water deplete.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nEverything I achieved was from food and training. That's my secret. I worked within the paramaters available to me. Sure, I had a restricted diet, but IIFYM meant all I had to do was hit my macros. I tracked and weighed everything that I ate. And I worked incredibly hard in the gym. I never went to bed hungry.\n\n\n****\n\n**Physical changes in those  12 weeks**\n\n[Front](http://i.imgur.com/VlR6uWR.jpg) [Back](http://i.imgur.com/1SGIevV.jpg) [Side](http://i.imgur.com/qfNyOow.jpg)\n\nI'm 31. I am 165cm / 5 foot 4 tall.\nI now weigh 60.3kg / 138kg (I had 2 weeks off at the end of the transformation, I had a few cupcakes but I'm back to it now!)\n\n\nStats | Before | After\n---------|----------|----------\nWeight | 67.3kg / 140 pounds | 59.2kg / 130 pounds\nChest | 97cm / 38.1 inches | 92cm / 36 inches\nArms  | 31cm / 12.2 inches| 28cm / 11 inches\nHips | 96cm / 37.7 inches| 84cm / 33 inches\nWaist |79cm / 31.1 inches | 69.5cm / 27.3 inches\nThighs | 54.5cm / 21.4 inches | 49.5cm / 19.4 inches\n&nbsp;\n\n**Mental changes in those 12 weeks.**\n&nbsp;\n\nI really do feel like a completely different person. People have picked up on the changes in my posture, in how I carry myself in general. I'm no longer invisible. I'm wearing form fitting clothes. Today I bought a top that shows my midriff. I'm so different from that girl that I was when I was 20. She's unrecognisable. But I do feel that I lost a whole chunk of my life. Right now I'm making up for it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**What now?**\n&nbsp;\n\nAs I said earlier, there's no touchdown dance. I'm not finished. I've done a little happiness jig here and there. Mostly in between sets. The 12 week transformation might be over, but I have signed up for the next one. It's another 6 weeks. I call this one \"the quest for abs.\"  And I will probably do the one after that. I'm loving every minute of it. It's been a lot of hard work, but I really have enjoyed it all. I barely need my asthma medication now. I still have to be careful with everything I do, keep working on my fitness, do my best not to get sick or injured (because that could put me out for way longer than most people) and see my doctors regularly and all that jazz. But I'm functioning. And happy. I couldn't have done it without the direction and support of my trainer. He took all the guess work out of it for me. But now I want to learn for myself, so I'm now studying to become a personal trainer. But most importantly, I finally feel comfortable in my own skin. \n\n[Link to album of images.](http://imgur.com/a/4Bqc9)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n****\n\n\n**tldr:** Was a normal teenager, my body decided to stage a revolt and I dropped to 45kg/99 pounds.

It will probably be used at a pace of .5mph or 1mph.  At 1mph the tread only produces 35db and I would not be wearing loud shoes if I plan on walking all day.  Even at this measly pace of .5 mph people could expect to burn a significant number of calories but this has more to do with just staying moving and not sitting myself to death.

David Horne, who's a world champion in grip sports of all kinds has created an official beginner routine some years ago, and it's also the official routine we recommend for people with weak grip.\n\nIf you want stronger grip or stronger wrists, you should definitely check it out! It takes only 10 minutes to do and all you need is a barbell and plates. You can find the official routine description on David's website **[here](http://web.archive.org/web/20160427205159/http://www.davidhorne-gripmaster.com/basics.html)** - to make it easier to understand, i'll provide pictures and a video in this post aswell.\n\n* The routine consists of 4 different exercises that focus on your pinch grip, your wrist strength and your crush grip. You can do this beginner routine 2-3 times a week and repeat each exercise for 3 sets. Aim for 15-20 repetitions, or 15 seconds for the hold. Rest as much as you need between the exercises.\n\n* The first exercise is the **[Two Hands Pinch Lift](http://imgur.com/fMhtx0s)**. Grab a plate with reasonable weight (that you can hold up to 15 seconds) and pinch it really hard. If you don't want to rip your skin as a beginner, feel free to wear gloves.\n\n* The second exercise are **[Finger Curls](http://imgur.com/Tt7pWAK)**. Grab the bar in a pronated grip and let the bar roll down into your fingertips. Make sure that you don't let it slip. Then crush the bar up into your palm, without using your wrist. This trains your crush grip and your finger strength.\n\n* Third exercise are **[Two Hand Wrist Curls](http://imgur.com/cUTexlA)**. Grab the bar in a pronated grip and move your wrist up and down. Do not move your fingers, just your wrist. This one will give you a really good burn after some repetitions.\n\n* Fourth exercise are the **[Two Hands Reverse Wrist Curls](http://imgur.com/UD57Uj5)**. They are the same exercise as number three, just with a reverse grip (supinated).\n\nAnd that's it. You're done with grip training for the day. You can do this at the end of your usual workout, and in a few weeks your grip will really improve! I've also prepared a video of all the exercises that you'll find linked below - and where i explain the routine in detail again.\n\nI've got some questions for you guys aswell, to start a discussion:\n\n* What do you do to train your grip?\n* Do you think griptraining is important?\n\n\n* **[Here's the link of the detailed video, if you missed it above.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGuVJAj96SE)**", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "If you always wanted to start griptraining, but don't know how: here's the official /r/griptraining beginner routine as a video.", "post_ups": 2140, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7ixreg/if_you_always_wanted_to_start_griptraining_but/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:16.858741", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "dirtyStick84", "post_created_utc": 1476793568.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "583hbp", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 720, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2127, "post_selftext": "\nI first got into fitness while in high school where I attended a boxing gym which got me into running and some calesthetics.  After high school I joined the military and the majority of my fitness for the next 5 years was running / swimming.  I did some weight training but mostly just for strength and never really reaped the physique benefits until later years where I trained with bodybuilding types.  After the military I came home and got into Crossfit for a couple years, I love the intensity, all around fitness approach, competition and comraderie however it eventually just consumed too much of my time and I'm motivated my self to do most of the workouts outside of an actual box.  I continued to train like this for a few years until I made a friend who is more of a bodybuilder and began training with him.  From bodybuilding I built the best physique I've ever had and felt my diet and metabolism we're the most in check they've ever been.  \n\nSo here is my dilemma, I now see really two ends of a fitness spectrum in a sense on one end running, swimming, biking, etc.. Endurance training where I feel very clear-headed, energetic & just lighter / swifter on my feet.  On the other end of the spectrum is bodybuilding, metcons, olympic lifts, etc... Weightlifting.  From this end I feel strong, most confident about my body, metabolism feels more in check.  However with this end (weightlifting) I get bigtime fogginess after intense training sessions which can make it difficult at work when I lift at lunch time, whereas with morning runs I feel far more focused, productive and seemingly improved problem solving skills.  My job performance has to be my priority over physique obviously, but before fully shifting to the endurance side I'm hoping to find a way to reap benefits of both, and perhaps someone with similar thoughts could share with my any advice that has been helpful to them.

At my peak, when I was 26, I weighed 198 lbs and could bench press 325 lbs, and probably hit the gym about 5 days per week. Then one day I just stopped going. Fast forward 8 years to June 2016, I randomly stepped on the scale to find that I once again weighed 198 lbs, but clearly very little of that was muscle. Seeing that number come up on the scale was depressing, because it made me think of how disappointed 26-year-old me would be. Somehow over 8 years I had let my body fat creep up and cardiovascular health creep down to the point where I couldn't even run up the basement stairs without getting winded.\n\nI had zero excuses, my wife and I have a treadmill, elliptical machine, and small set of weights in the basement that I could have been using, but I never did, because why bother? I'm mid-30's now, too old to turn things around, and besides, it's not like I can carve any time out of my busy schedule of watching YouTube and drinking, right? Maybe tomorrow, or next week if I run out of TV shows to watch...\n\nStep 1 was snapping right the f*** out of that mindset. Seeing 198 lbs on the scale did that for me, I had to stop with all the half-assed excuses and get into gear! I did a 20-minute session on the elliptical that day, and it kicked my ass. Afterward, I didn't want to feel all that pain for nothing, so I ate a healthy dinner. Then the next day I ate healthy all day, and went for another 20 minutes on the elliptical. Then over the next month I built up to 40-minute sessions at higher resistance. I started reading r/fitness and using My Fitness Pal, adjusting my diet as I went. Then I started using those weights that had been collecting dust for so long. During all of this I took a picture nearly every day after my post-workout shower, and today, six months later, I threw together a little gif of what happened during those six months:\n\n**Before**: http://i.imgur.com/8FPiqcO.jpg\n\n**After**: http://i.imgur.com/ax1JX9P.jpg\n\n**Inbetween**: http://i.imgur.com/zavYS4b.gifv\n\nWatching that still blows my mind, I can't believe it's only been six months. Some of my friends have asked why I suddenly care so much about the way I look, but forget the way I look, what I care about is how it feels! I have so much energy now, so much focus and drive, that the thought of not being able to find time to work out every day is laughable. I feel more awake in the morning, fall asleep easier at night, I'm more focused at work, when I get home all I want to do is get up off my ass and find a project to work on, or do something fun with my wife. My mood has improved, I feel much more comfortable in my clothes (and out of them), I feel strong and alive, it's hard to think of one single area of my life that hasn't changed for the better. I haven't even felt a hangover in months, not even after nights of heavy drinking. In only six months!\n\nWhen I started I was completely sure that none of this was possible, but I gave it a shot anyway, and it was one of the best decisions of my life. No matter what age, what starting weight, what level of activity you're coming from, if you want to get into shape, all you have to do is stop making excuses and GET STARTED. Once you've done that, you'll find reasons to keep going. I've learned to keep it interesting by changing my goals often, I feel like I stopped in the first place because I let it get boring by doing the same thing day in and day out. Now whenever I feel that exercising or eating healthy is becoming a chore, I adjust my goal to make it fun and interesting again. Anyone can do it! :-)\n\nAnd since I totally forgot to include my diet and exercise routines the first time (sorry!), here we go...\n\n**ROUTINES**\n\nThe first three months were fat burning months. I didn't log much of my diet at first, but I quickly found out how easy it is to count calories with myfitnesspal, so I started tracking and ended up with this as a typical day:\n\n**Food**: 1800 kcal per day - ~30% protein, ~20% fat, ~50% carbs\n\n**Workout**: 20-40 minute elliptical sessions, 6 days per week\n\n**Every few days**: light strength training with dumbbells, typically one set of 15 reps (not to failure) for each major muscle group.\n\nI was mostly counting calories at that point instead of macros, which was super effective. I figured a 40 minute elliptical session was burning about 300 kcal, so I believe I was taking in a net 1500 kcal per day, which allowed me to drop almost 30 lbs in three months! After reaching 170 lbs I shifted my focus to muscle building (always adjust your goals!), and I also splurged on a Bowflex Blaze, so I switched three days per week from cardio to strength training. I also upped my calorie intake and paid more attention to macros, so here's a typical week for that:\n\n**Food**: 2500 kcal per day - ~25% protein, ~20% fat, ~55% carbs\n\n**M,W,F workout**: one exercise each of chest, back, shoulders, biceps, triceps, quads, hamstrings, calves, and abs, for 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n\n**T,Th,Sa workout**: 30 minute elliptical sessions\n\n(one set of abs every day)\n\nThis hurt really bad at first, because I hadn't lifted any serious weights in a long time, but I got used to it quickly. I gained one or two pounds in a few weeks, but I didn't really dig the whole-body weight training sessions, because I felt like I didn't have adequate time to recover before the next session, so from there I shifted into a split routine:\n\n**M, Th workout**: three back exercises (ex: pull-ups, bent-over rows, and deadlifts), one biceps exercise, all for 4 sets of 10-15 reps.\n\n**T, F workout**: two chest exercises (ex: dumbbell flys, incline dumbbell presses), two shoulder exercises (ex: Arnold presses, lateral raises), one triceps exercise, all for 4 sets of 10-15 reps.\n\n**W, Sa workout**: Two quad exercises (ex: squats, leg extensions), one hamstring exercise, one calf exercise, one glute exercise, all for 4 sets of 10-15 reps.\n\n(one set of abs every day)\n\nI'm still doing these workouts now, although I'm thinking of changing up to a different split, since I've been on this one for about six weeks now. Sometimes I throw in extra sets, but the workouts are normally 50-70 minutes long. In the last month I've also changed my diet slightly, because I watched an Athean-X video about positive nitrogen balance, and wanted to see what happens if I maintain a caloric deficit while consuming one gram of protein per pound of body weight every day, so that looks a little like this:\n\n**Food**: 2100 kcal per day - 40% protein (~170g), 45% carbs, 15% fat\n\nSo far so good, I actually dropped a couple more pounds and ended up at 167, but my strength has been improving, so maybe it's not a myth that you can lose fat and gain muscle simultaneously? Either way, none of this would've been possible if I didn't get up and start somewhere, you can do the same!\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Six month transformation, SW 198 lbs, CW 167 lbs (M/34/5'10\")", "post_ups": 2123, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5ex5b8/six_month_transformation_sw_198_lbs_cw_167_lbs/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:16.859082", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "2ipperz", "post_created_utc": 1530207305.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "8uln5h", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 445, "post_num_crossposts": 2, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2118, "post_selftext": "i\u2019m aware that workouts that \u201cpull\u201d work out your back and biceps, but after a back day (trying to focus primarily on back) i barely feel anything in my back and after a couple sets my biceps are worn out completely as if i were working out my arms. any advice?", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "When I do try to workout my back, I barely feel it in my back and feel like I am working my biceps out so much more", "post_ups": 2118, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8uln5h/when_i_do_try_to_workout_my_back_i_barely_feel_it/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:16.859082", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "TheGreatCthulhu", "post_created_utc": 1420209497.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1425313990.0, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2r3phs", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 468, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2112, "post_selftext": "Each New Year swimming pools and experienced swimmers see a sudden influx of new swimmers. Almost all have disappeared again by the middle of February. \n\nEdit: I forgot to add, I'd you to keep swimming. I'd like to help to you to keep swimming.  What I've written below is the one-post context of many thing about swimming that you won't find in one or two weeks of swimming. If you know something is hard for *everyone*, then it's easier to motivate yourself when it's hard for you. Swimming is hard for me, and for every other swimmer.\n\nI write a popular swimming blog and I Mod /r/swimming. To make it easier for us all, [here's my annual advice for those of you starting the new year in the water](http://loneswimmer.com/2015/01/01/advice-for-new-year-swimming-resolutions-whether-for-health-swimming-improvement-or-weight-management/). Below are the main points.\n\n* **Swimming is hard**. For non-swimmers swimming is harder than most realise and not easy to take up as a regular sport. All those good swimmers you see have excellent cardio-respiratory fitness and often years of technique training. So don't be discouraged. And...\n\n* **Get technique advice**. Most pools, even those that don't have clubs, will have swim classes. Swimmers cannot tell what they doing wrong, especially when they don't know what the correct technique is. The first step in improving is finding out what you are doing right now, so simple stroke analysis is very valuable.\n\n* **Consistency is the single most important fitness action**. Like every sport. Don't give up. Keep swimming, keep working on fitness and technique. A good target of absolute minimum swimming for very new swimmers is three times a week. Keep swimming. Keep swimming.\n\n* **Keep records**. Whether a simple notebook or spreadsheet, make notes of where you started: Weight, morning resting heart rate, how far or fast you can swim (but try to forget speed). Without knowing your start point you will not be able to realistically gauge your improvements.\n\n* **Learn to breathe**. This is [the single most repeated problem on /r/Swimmit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/search?q=breathing&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) or to any swimmer or swim coach. This is improved with technique. The key is exhaling underwater. It is not easy and takes time but the time you spend on it at the start when you feel you should be swimming will repay itself a thousand-fold (at least) later on.\n\n* **Understand lane etiquette**. Swimmers of all speeds and abilities can happily co-exist in a pool, if everyone knows and adheres to the same [lane etiquette](http://loneswimmer.com/2011/02/15/lane-swimming-etiquette/). Otherwise chaos and lane rage will ruin everyone's swim.\n\n* **Vary the Intensity**. New swimmers are prone to swimming up and down without varying the intensity. You need to swimming a mix of aerobic, anaerobic and threshold levels (slow and easy, medium, and overload/sprint).\n\n* **Swimming is poor for weight management for beginners**. While there are of course success stories, beginners think being out of breathe is the same as swimming hard. Swimming, unlike most other sports, is also an appetite stimulant. For swimming to be an effective weight weight management system it needs to be consistent and efficient, with control applied to your diet.\n\n* **Use the pace clock.** That funny looking swimming clock with one hand is most useful for beginners to keep check on their rest times. Less resting on the wall and more swimming. Try to keep all your rest times below 30 seconds.\n\n* **Ask other swimmers for help**. We are glad to assist, we've all been where you are and we know swimming requires more than one person. Just try to ask in between sets, not during but since it's hard to tell sometimes, if they tell you they'll be able to help in 5, 10 or 15 minutes, they mean it.\n\n* **Going to the sauna isn't swimming**. Neither is hanging off the wall. \n\n* **Have realistic expectations.** Losing lots of weight and dropping 20 seconds per 100m aren't realistic. Zero to hero in four weeks isn't realistic. Getting fitter and being able to swim further over a few months as a basis for further improvements *ARE* realistic. \n\n* **Enjoy your improvements**. If you are not enjoying it, you will not stay at it. It's okay that's it's hard, but if you are realistic and consistent, you will enjoy it.\n\n/r/Swimming isn't just for New Year, it's a life sentence!", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "For those of you hoping to use swimming for fitness, weight management or swimming improvement in the New Year, here's some hopefully useful information.", "post_ups": 2112, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2r3phs/for_those_of_you_hoping_to_use_swimming_for/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:16.859082", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Zachanner", "post_created_utc": 1399180958.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "24obkm", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 235, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2111, "post_selftext": "Hi, my name is Zach Anner and I'm the host of the comedic fitness show \"Workout Wednesday\" on Youtube.

I\u2019ve broken my progress down into 4 distinct phases I went through giving the details I can remember about my diet (most important) and workouts. You\u2019ll notice I kind of eased into the whole thing for two reasons. I want the transformation to be permanent, and I don\u2019t want the act of getting fit to consume my life. I\u2019m not interested in being a powerlifter, gaining huge amounts of muscle, or participating in any competitions so I don\u2019t have any stats to share. I\u2019m a pretty average guy who has a goal to simply look and feel healthy and not feel guilty about indulging with food or beverages once or twice a week. \n\n[Progress!](http://imgur.com/lNDQ9Gv)\n\n**The beginning (Jan-April) Ending weight 183 pounds**\n\n**Diet:** I wasn\u2019t doing any calorie counting at this point, eating out for lunch five days a week, eating out for dinner 2-3 times a week, and usually every meal except breakfast on weekends. I was trying to eat \u201chealthy\u201d, but without tracking anything who knows if I was actually accomplishing that goal.\n**Workout:** 2-3 years ago I had been heavy into biking and triathlons but hadn\u2019t been very active since then. I joined a gym in October and started lifting like a noob. My routine basically consisted of chest and abs 3 times a week and then throwing in a back and biceps day every once in a while. I would jump on machines that were empty and would just pick up what I could for 3x10. I wasn\u2019t too interested in getting more serious and just wanted to ease my way into fitness again. Oh, and I didn\u2019t do leg day *ducks and hides*\n\n**I can do better (April-June) Ending weight 172 pounds**\n\t\n**Diet:** I decided that all the eating out I was doing wasn\u2019t going to get me to where I wanted to go and it certainly wasn\u2019t nice to the wallet. I started cooking meals at home and reduced my eating out to once every other week for lunch and twice a week for dinner including weekends. Most meals included protein such as chicken or turkey burgers along with vegetables and rice. I learned to love the vegetable steamer bags, five minutes in the microwave and you\u2019re golden. I\u2019m still not tracking anything at this point, but the pounds start coming off.\n**Workout:** After just screwing around at the gym I decided to start focusing my workouts a bit more. At this point I\u2019m still not interested in getting too regimented but I wanted to expand what I was doing. I put exercises into two \u201cgroups\u201d and would try to do each group twice per week, they were as follows:\n*Chest/abs/triceps group:* dumbbell press, inclined press, bench press, seated flys, declined sit-ups, leg lifts, oblique twist machine (fittit hates that right?), cable machine for triceps both push down and overhead, dips\n*Legs/back/biceps:* squats, dead lifts, leg press, calf raises, pullups, lat pull down, seated rows, dumbbell rows, standing bicep curls, shrugs \n\n**Let\u2019s get serious already (June-August) Ending weight 167 pounds**\n\n**Diet:** I finally downloaded MyFitnessPal again and began tracking my calories. For June through the middle of July I was taking in around 1500 calories per day with a cheat day about every 10 days that would be around 2300 calories. From the middle of July until the past week I was taking in 1700 calories a day and eating a 40/35/25 protein/fat/carb diet. Typical meals were as follows; Breakfast: oatmeal, eggs, greek yogurt *(glad someone turned me on to this absolutely delicious food)*, occasionally bacon. Lunch: Chicken/turkey burger/pork chop, rice, broccoli/string beans/carrots/steamers! Dinner: Chicken/turkey burger/pork chop, broccoli/string beans/carrots/steamers! Snacks: granola bars, peanut butter, rice cakes. Cheat meals, which were typically a meal out, happened about once every two weeks.\n**Workout:** I basically continued doing the \u201cgroups\u201d I had put together previously and added in 30 minutes to an hour of cardio a week, usually just a session on an inclined treadmill walking. I would do some days at higher weight and fewer reps and then other days with higher reps and lower weight. As I said in the intro, I\u2019m not that concerned with hitting any specific weights or PRs (this may change when I start trying to build muscle).\n\n**Peak! (5 days before a vacation) Ending weight 163 pounds**\n**Diet:** For the first three days I reduced carbs in the following order 80g, 60g, 30g. Fat was kept under 50g and protein was over 160g. On day 4 carbs were 280g, fat was 30g, and protein was  150g. For the first three days I was taking in 1.5 - 2 gallons of water (and visiting the bathroom a ton). Day 4 reduced water intake to about 20 ounces. The final photo was taken the morning of day 5.\n**Workout:** Didn\u2019t do anything for day 1 or 2. On day 3 I did a full body workout at about 50% of the weight I typically lift. I did 12-15 reps for 3 sets on each exercise (bench, squat, dead lift, pull ups, lat pull down, standing curls, dips, inclined sit-ups). On day 4 I did a bit of cardio.\n\n**Supplements:** I typically would do a scoop of protein powder a day for breakfast and occasionally after workouts. I used pre workout for every third or fourth trip to the gym.\n\n\nSo there you have it, no fancy lifting routine, no grocery list of supplements, and just staying on top of the food I\u2019m eating for six and a half days a week on average. I\u2019ll try and answer any questions if there are any.\n\nEdit: Wow, this totally blew up. I was expecting some congratulations and a few questions, but nothing of this magnitude.

If you are looking for references I put them in the comment section a few times when people asked for them.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nCreatine is a nonessential dietary compound (a nitrogenous organic acid) that can either be ingested from exogenous sources such as fish or meat, or produced endogenously, primarily by the liver. Most creatine is found in skeletal muscle. Investigations of creatine as an oral supplement began in the early 1900s with the extraction of creatine from meat. Since then, creatine supplementation has been used for a variety of conditions such as congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis, and neuro-degenerative diseases (Greenhaff et al. 1998, Matthews et al. 1998). The most prevalent use of creatine supplementation today is sport or exercise enhancement. Bemben et al. (2005) estimated that more than 2.5 million kilograms of creatine are used each year, with creatine sales increasing to over $200 million in 1998. Furthermore, creatine is not regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration nor banned by the International Olympic Committee or National Collegiate Athletic Association (Mangus).\n\tCreatine supplementation has become very popular among many different generations and populations. In fact, twelve years ago Dempsey et al. (2002) reported that creatine was the most widely used performance-enhancing supplement among youth aged 10-17 years, with 15% to 30% of high school athletes and 48% of male Division I college athletes reporting creatine use. In addition, many recreational exercisers, the elderly, and children as young as 10 of both sexes ingest creatine in hopes of improving physical performance (Grindstaff et al. 1997, Berman et al. 1998, Unnithan et al. 2002). Creatine has been shown to improve strength and hypertrophy, and it appears to be most effective for activities that involve repeated short bouts of high-intensity physical activity (Earnest et al. 1995)\n\tA handful of factors must be addressed before the user considers creatine supplementation. One such factor is the extent to which creatine improves strength. Becque et al. (2000) showed that after resistance training and supplementing with creatine for 6 weeks, arm flexor 1RM increased 29% while in the placebo group, 1RM increased only 16.5%. Earnest et al. (1995) found that creatine increased bench press 1RM by 6% after 28 days of resistance training while placebo decreased 1RM by 3%. Subjects on creatine were also able to bench press 26% more repetitions in a muscle fatigue test after training compared to before training, while placebo subjects neither increased nor decreased in number of repetitions. Volek et al. (1998) showed that after a 12-week resistance program, subjects who supplemented with creatine improved squat 1RM by 32% while placebo improved squat 1RM by 24%. \nAnother consideration is whether creatine induces muscular hypertrophy. Olsen et al. (2006) found that creatine supplementation in association with strength training amplifies the training-induced increase in the number of satellite cells and myonuclei in human skeletal muscle fibers. After 12 weeks of resistance training, Volek et al. (1999) reported that the percentage increases in cross-sectional area for all muscle fiber types in creatine subjects ranged from 29% to 35%\u2014more than twice the increase observed in placebo subjects. Becque et al. (2000) took three upper-arm circumference measurements on all subjects before a 6-week resistance training program. After 6 weeks, subjects on creatine significantly increased all three upper-arm circumference measurements while subjects on placebo did not. However, this increase may be due to water content, which is a side effect discussed later in this paper.\n\tDosage, timing and frequency are other important considerations when supplementing with creatine. Candow et. al (2011) studied frequency by having two groups take equal dosages of creatine, but exercise at different frequencies. One group exercised 2 days per week and the other group exercised 3 days per week.  After testing and analysis, researchers determined that equal-dosage creatine supplementation led to similar gains in muscle thickness and strength between the two groups. Antonio et al. (2013) studied timing of creatine ingestion and determined that post-workout creatine supplementation was more beneficial than that of pre workout with regard to improvement in fat free mass, fat mass, and 1RM bench press. Bemben et al. (2005) discussed creatine dosage. The authors performed a meta analysis and found that dosages were similar throughout most studies. Twenty grams of creatine were typically ingested during the first 4-7 days of supplementation, a phase known as creatine loading. Following creatine loading, subjects consumed 5 grams per day. This appears to be the optimal dosage for effectiveness.\n\tOther benefits of creatine include muscle damage recovery and improvements in fat-free body mass. Cooke et al. (2009) examined creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, which are widely accepted markers of muscle damage, in muscle biopsies of subjects who participated in an exercise session designed to cause muscle damage. They found that subjects who took creatine had lower plasma CK and LDH levels than those taking placebo in the days following exercise. Becque et al. (2000), Volek et al. (1999), and Antonio et al. (2013) found that subjects who supplemented with creatine increased fat free mass more than subjects who took placebo.\n\tThe purpose of this paper is to examine potential mechanisms by which creatine supplementation increases strength and hypertrophy during resistance training. This topic is important due to the many individuals who are supplementing with creatine to increase strength and hypertrophy. As the use of creatine supplementation continues to increase, so does the need to investigate its effects on the human body.\n\n\n**Rationale for Use and Mechanism of Drug Action**\n\nIndividuals who supplement with creatine typically do so in order to receive ergogenic benefits or an improved physique. Some individuals take creatine specifically to increase strength. Increasing strength benefits nearly all athletes, especially those involved in contact sports such as football. For example, increased strength would improve the performance of an offensive lineman who must constantly push against heavy forces. In addition, some individuals ingest, or are prescribed, creatine in order to change their physical appearance. Males, specifically, tend to desire a physique in which their muscles are larger and fuller. Other individuals, such as the elderly, may be prescribed creatine as a therapeutic strategy. Gotshalk et al. (2002) found that 7 days of creatine supplementation (0.3 g per kg) in older men was effective at increasing several indices of muscle performance and functional tests. These tests included 1RM for leg press and bench press, maximal isometric strength, upper and lower-body explosive power, timed sit-stand test and tandem gait test. This could reduce the loss in muscle strength that occurs with aging and increase performance of functional living tasks.  \n\tThere are several lesser-known purposes of creatine supplementation. One such example is the prescription of creatine for individuals with congestive heart failure (CHF). These individuals tend to have abnormalities of skeletal muscle. These abnormalities may be an important determinant of symptoms in those with chronic heart failure. Greenhaff et al. (1998) found improvements in skeletal muscle endurance and metabolic response to exercise after creatine supplementation in patients with CHF. Subjects who took creatine increased maximum voluntary contraction in handgrip exercise while those who took placebo did not increase muscle contraction. Those who took creatine also decreased lactate and ammonia (markers of fatigue) levels in the blood 30 minutes post exercise, while those who took placebo did not have decreased levels of lactate and ammonia. This study means creatine could result in substantial symptomatic improvement in these CHF patients. Kuethe et. al (2005) also found that short-term creatine supplementation, in addition to standard medication in patients with CHF, led to an increase in body weight and an improvement of muscle strength. Creatine is also prescribed to those with neuro-degenerative diseases. For example, Matthews et al. (1998) found that treatment with creatine may be a novel therapeutic strategy to slow or halt neurodegeneration in Huntington\u2019s Disease as well as other neurodegenerative diseases in which deficits in energy metabolism are indicated. Dedeoglu et al. (2003) and Hersch et al. (2006) also found evidence of creatine supplementation having neuroprotective effects on those with Huntington\u2019s disease.\n\tCreatine is first synthesized by a two-step process involving three amino acids (arginine, glycine and methionine) in the liver, kidney and pancreas. It is then released into the blood. Since creatine is produced outside the muscles, it must enter the muscle cell against a concentration gradient. Creatine enters the cell via Cr transporter-1, a sodium-dependent transporter (Bemben et al., 2005). About 95% of the body\u2019s total creatine is found in skeletal muscle, and the remaining 5% is in the heart, brain and testes. In skeletal muscle, 40% of the creatine is in free-form (Cr) and 60% is in the phosphorylated form (PCr). PCr levels are higher in type II (fast twitch) muscle fibers compared to type I (slow twitch) fibers. (Bemben et al., 2005). Supplementing with oral creatine increases skeletal muscle creatine concentration by 16 to 50% (Dempsey et al., 2002). When the body needs to excrete creatine, it is converted to creatinine. Creatinine is a byproduct of muscle metabolism that is derived from Cr and PCr. Creatinine is filtered in the kidneys via diffusion, sent to the bladder, and excreted through the urine.\n\tCreatine acts via several mechanisms. When an individual takes part in high-intensity, short duration activities such as lifting weights or sprinting, skeletal muscle cells require immediate availability of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). PCr is the primary energy storage molecule for the rapid rephosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) back to ATP by the creatine kinase (CK) reaction. This reaction provides muscle cells with more ATP, which is required for the reactions involved in muscle contraction. ATP is needed to bind actin and myosin to form a cross-bridge. ATP must also bind to myosin to break the cross-bridge and enable the myosin to rebind to actin at the next muscle contraction. Creatine also helps to deliver more oxidatively-produced ATP via a process termed the PCr shuttle (Bessman et al., 1981). The PCr shuttle process occurs when free Cr diffuses toward the mitochondrial membrane. At the inner mitochondrial membrane, a phosphate is transported and Cr is phosphorylated again into PCr. This PCr then diffuses back toward the myosin heads of the muscle. PCr is transported back and forth; hence, it is called the PCr shuttle. \nCreatine also has the capacity to buffer pH changes in the muscle. Muscle acidity occurs at the onset of physical activity due to hydrogen ion accumulation and results in decreased muscle pH. This leads to decreased muscle performance. Creatine buffers the pH by utilizing the excess hydrogen during the CK reaction and rephosphorylation of ADP to ATP (Mesa et al., 2002). \nCreatine also regulates glycolysis. When energy demands increase during exercise, PCr concentrations decline. The body must now find another way to rephosphorylate ADP. This is accomplished by an increase in glycolytic flux. Glycolytic flux is stimulated by phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is a key glycolytic enzyme. This enzyme is partly inhibited when PCr is present. Therefore, the decrease of PCr consequentially results in increased glycolysis (Volek et al., 1996). Supplementing with creatine increases the amount of PCr available in the body, thus delaying glycolytic flux. \n\tSome researchers have offered alternative explanations as to how creatine contributes to muscle hypertrophy. Poortmans et al. (2000) suggested that creatine may cause an osmotic loading effect resulting in the movement of extracellular water into the muscle cell, which is a stimulus for protein synthesis. Hespel et al. (2002) suggested that creatine can shorten relaxation time during maximal isometric contraction by facilitating calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Change in body mass due to creatine supplementation is a controversial topic that is still being researched, but most studies report significant increases in body mass.\n\n**Side Effects, Risks, and Prevalence for Abuse/Misuse**\t\n\nAccording to Bemben et. al (2005), researchers tend to agree about the side effects of creatine supplementation. No strong scientific evidence supports serious adverse effects. A majority of reports have been minor and purely anecdotal. Dempsey et. al (2002) found that in two retrospective trials no adverse effects were reported from longer term creatine supplementation. Both studies were up 4-5 years. However, there have not been many long-term studies exploring side effects and more research is needed. Some reported side effects include gastrointestinal pain, renal and liver function problems, muscle cramping, and water retention (Bemben et al., 2005).\n\tGastrointestinal distress is the most frequently reported side effect of creatine supplementation. Mesa et al. (2002) and Poortmans et. al (2000) reported that if creatine is insufficiently dissolved or if it is ingested during or immediately after exercise, it causes an upset stomach. However, when a placebo group has been included in a double-blinded study, there appears to be no detrimental effect on the GI system (Romer et al., 2001). Poortmans et al. (2000) investigated renal function following creatine supplementation by examining urinary creatinine clearance. Subjects took individual doses from 1 to 20 g creatine up to 1 to 4 doses per day. Daily doses were ingested every day of the week for a period from 10 months to 5 years. The researchers found no indication of impaired renal function. Bemben et al. (2005) explained that most reports of muscle cramping following creatine supplementation have been anecdotal and unverified. Researchers speculate that those who experience cramps do so due to the high intensity of the workout or to a disruption in electrolyte balance (Mesa et al., 2002). \n\tEarly changes have been observed in body weight following creatine supplementation. Researchers believe that this is probably due to increases in body water, specifically in the intracellular compartments within the muscle cell (Mesa et al., 2002, Kern et al., 2001). Researchers speculate that the reason for the increase in intracellular water is the increased osmotic load associated with the elevated creatine concentrations within the cell. Increased intracellular water should be kept in mind when reading studies that claim creatine is directly responsible for hypertrophy. Increases in muscle cross-sectional area may be attributed to increased muscle hypertrophy, but the increase in size may actually be due to intracellular water retention. \n\tIt appears that the benefits of creatine far outweigh the risks. Mangus et. al explained that most creatine users would argue that the greatest benefit from its use is in activities that require rapid muscle recovery throughout the exercise period. When surveyed, most athletes demonstrated a good knowledge of the actual reported adverse effects. Although athletes acknowledge the potential risks associated with creatine supplementation, they continue to use it as a supplement because they do not believe the risks are long term or cause any physiological changes in their bodies. \n\n**The Mechanisms Behind the Muscle**\n\nIt would be difficult to dispute the evidence that supplementation of creatine in addition to resistance training improves strength, hypertrophy, and performance. Volek et al. (1999), Becque et al. (1999), Earnest et al. (1995), Dempsey et al. (2002), and Olsen et al. (2006) are just a few of the many published works that have shown greater 1RM increases in those who supplement with creatine compared to those on placebo. Earnest et al. (1995), Volek et al. (1999), Cooke et al. (2001), along with many others, found that performance factors such as total anaerobic work, fatigue, peak power, and isometric and isokinetic knee extension peak torque improved more in creatine groups compared to placebo. Becque et al. (1999), Earnest et al. (1995), Volek et al. (1999), and Candow et al. (2011), Olsen et al. (2006), and Antonio et al. (2013) revealed greater increases in body mass, fat-free mass, mean muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and arm thickness in creatine groups compared to placebo groups. These increases, however, may only be due to extra intracellular fluid. It is important to understand why the body responds this way when supplementing with creatine in conjunction resistance training.\nThe majority of researchers that showed improved strength and performance when supplementing creatine used the same basic type of exercise when testing their subjects. Subjects typically performed exercise that involved short periods of extremely powerful activity in repetitive bouts separated by short rest periods. This type of exercise primarily involves type II muscle fibers, which are fast-twitch fibers that are activated during quick and powerful anaerobic exercises. Volek et al. (1999) conducted a double blind study in which one group consumed 25 g of creatine per day and one group consumed a placebo. Both groups underwent a 12 week resistance training program. After the 12 weeks, researchers took muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscles of the subjects. The results showed a significant increase in the size of type II fibers in creatine subjects compared with placebo. The creatine group increased type IIA 36% and IIB 29% while placebo only increased type IIA 15% and type IIB 8%. These results indicate that additional creatine in the body enhances these type II muscle fibers, thus giving individuals on creatine an advantage in anaerobic-type exercises. Cooke et al. (2001) helps provide an explanation as to why creatine improves performance and strength during anaerobic, high intensity exercise. Researchers had 14 subjects perform 4 sets of 10 eccentric-only repetitions at 120% of their maximum concentric 1-RM on the leg press, leg extension and leg flexion machine. Blood samples were taken following exercise and examined for markers of muscle damage such as creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The creatine group had, on average, 84% lower plasma CK and plasma LDH than placebo after 48, 72, and 96 hours. This means that the creatine-supplemented group had an enhanced rate of muscle function recovery. Olsen et al. (2006) supported these findings by obtaining muscle biopsies of 32 males (age 19-28) who were split into creatine and placebo groups. All subjects resistance trained 3 times per week for 16 weeks. The creatine group consumed 3 g of creatine before and after each training session. At the conclusion of the 16 weeks, biopsies showed that the subjects in the creatine group increased their number of satellite cells significantly more than placebo. In addition, the creatine group resulted in an increased number of myonuclei per fiber and increased 14-17% in muscle mean fiber. This demonstrated for the first time in human skeletal muscle fibers that creatine supplementation amplifies the training-induced increase in satellite cell number and myonuclei concentration, and thus potentially muscle generation.\nAs stated earlier, creatine\u2019s primary mechanism of action is the increased delivery of ATP to the muscle and increased PCr resynthesis. This increase improves overall muscle energy and function. More ATP availability to the muscle would provide increased energy, and increased PCr resynthesis would delay fatigue and hasten recovery in an individual taking creatine. When adding up the components, it makes sense that creatine leads to improved strength and performance. Increased ATP, enhanced type II fibers, and faster recovery all give an advantage to individuals who are trying to improve strength and power.\nThe other aspect of creatine involves hypertrophy and increased body mass. Candow et al. (2011) examined body mass, fat free mass, and arm circumferences in 23 males before and after 6 weeks of training. One group took 5 g of creatine 4 times daily for 5 days and then took 2 g of creatine every day for the remainder of the study. The other group took a placebo. Body composition was taken via hydrostatic weighing, and muscle thickness was measured using B-mode ultrasound. After 6 weeks, body mass increased 2.3% in the creatine group while it only increased 0.2% in the placebo group. The creatine group increased elbow flexor muscle thickness by 20%, while placebo only increased 2.3%. The authors suggested that although both groups had increased stimulation rate of muscle proteins after resistance training, this response was delayed in those who didn\u2019t supplement with creatine. Additionally, one other proposed mechanism of hypertrophy is water retention. Balsom et al. (1995) suggested that creatine may alter the hydration status of muscles cells, resulting in increased mass. Bemben et al. (2005) stated that creatine may cause an osmotic loading effect, resulting in the movement of extracellular water into the muscle cell. Although there is a ample literature regarding the mechanisms behind hypertrophy, these studies can only go as far as suggesting mechanisms. Conclusive mechanisms are still being studied.\n\tSome studies found that creatine did not have any ergogenic effects. Stevenson et al. (2000) conducted an 8-week study with 18 resistance-trained subjects who were assigned to either creatine or a placebo in a randomized, double-blind fashion. The creatine group took 20 g for 7 days and then 5 g per day for the remainder of the study. During the 8 weeks, EMS was applied to the left quadriceps femoris twice weekly while all subjects continued voluntary resistance training of both lower limbs unsupervised. Cross-sectional area of each quadriceps femoris was assessed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). After 8 weeks, the results showed that the average cross-sectional area of the left quadriceps femoris increased equally in the creatine in placebo groups. In addition, maximal torque did not differ between the two groups. Dempsey et al. (2002) conducted a meta analysis and found that other than maximal resistance exercise performance, there is insufficient evidence that creatine improves other measure of strength, such as cycle ergometry sprint peak power or isokinetic dynamometer peak torque. The effect of creatine on endurance, submaximal exercise, or actual \u201con-field\u201d athletic performance was not addressed.\n\n**Summary and Conclusion**\t\n\nAfter reviewing much of the literature and research regarding creatine supplementation, it is evident that creatine is ergogenic, but only in specific modes of exercise. Creatine supplementation primarily benefits those who are performing short bouts of intense exercise, especially with short rest times between sets. Individuals who take creatine in conjunction with resistance training will increase maximal strength more than they would without creatine. In addition, individuals will be able to resist fatigue longer (during short-duration anaerobic exercise) than they would if they were not taking creatine. Creatine has also been linked to increases in muscle size and body mass, but this has not been the case in all studies. In addition, the mechanism behind these increases still remains unclear. More studies need to be conducted in order to identify if and how creatine may cause increased body and muscle mass. Another aspect that must be researched more is side effects associated with long-term use of creatine. Sports performance and endurance training are areas that also need more attention. Although it is sometimes assumed that increased strength will increase sports performance, this isn\u2019t necessarily the case. Reaction time, coordination, flexibility, and a number of other variables affect performance in each individual sport. Thus, research should be done to see exactly how creatine could boost performance in specific sports. \n\tIn conclusion, supplementing creatine while resistance training would be beneficial to individuals who want to gain an extra edge in terms of strength and (possibly) hypertrophy. Creatine offers a safe and affordable way to improve these parameters without risking your health, as seen in those who turn to anabolic steroids and prohormones instead. Creatine (like all drugs and substances) should be taken as directed and used in moderation, or side effects could emerge. For those who want to \u201cplay by the rules\u201d yet maximize performance, creatine is one option you can\u2019t go wrong with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Confused about creatine?

I was depressed, panicked, and in a massive mental depression.    \nI stepped on a scale, and saw a number that broke 300. For what I know now, I may not have weighed an *actual* 300, but that broke my mind then. With New Years rolling around I decided enough was enough. I was going to no longer be obese anymore.    \nI started off with just MyFitnessPal, and ate what it recommended to lose 2 lbs a week at like 1500. It was brutal, I felt like garbage honestly. But it was working.    \nThen spring rolled in, I adjusted my calories to 1800 and decided I needed exercise. I picked up couch to 5k, and occasionally went to the weight room with friends. Still felt like garbage mind you, I didn't know about TDEE, but soon found out about it towards the end of spring/beginning of summer. Through that summer I managed better with IIFYM and started caring about macros.\n\n#Fall 2015 to Spring 2016\n\nThis is when I got serious about my proton intake, and realized I needed to eat good food to not look like trash. Coming back to classes people noticed I was considerably skinnier. I started getting a lot of confidence here and did everything I could to be active at the gym. I got in WAAAAAY over my head on a program (Lee Haywards 12 week program!!!! hit it up!) but I liked it cause it was aimed at body building and ideally I wanted aesthetics as much as possible. I ended the year at about ~222lbs    \nWinter came and so did /r/BTFC for me. I decided to get serious with this years resolution and finish the job. I joined the cutting category (Mistake! but 20/20 hindsight) and worked my but off. I continued Lee Haywards 12 week program, because it fits my school schedule/work amazingly. I did my first pullup around this time, one of my huge goals, and to the end of the spring I was utterly thrilled. I hit one goal I thought I would never see. That fucking third digit was a one. 199.5lbs. I cried (I'm tearin' now typin this TBH) This was the first time, in my young adult life I have EVER seen that digit. It was so foreign, I came to realize I can get a lot more done putting my mind to it.    \nBout putting my mind to it. Spring comes in, and its back to class for me. And I realize my grades have hit the shit box. I'm a senior at this time (1 year left), and my GPA was like a lousy 2.5 or 2.4. It turned out, going from Excited freshman->depressed sophomore -> dangerously losing weight up to junior can moderately fuck that shit up. I decided to eat a bit more and gym better. Bumped up to around 2000kcals, and focused more in class. Realized it was a lot easier to focus and perform in class by being physically active, and pursued activity as a means to relax more. Still kept the Hayward program, but did more cardio for fun. Coming back to campus was awesome that term. I kinda disappeared from the campus for awhile doin' my weightloss chrysalis for awhile. People just started to flat out not recognize me. It got really cool talking to people, and I got a lot more social from here.\n\n#Summer 2016 to now\n\nSummer was my last big punch. Run to the finish line and hit that sub BMI of 25 and medically statistically no longer be \"overweight\". Just stuck to the program and kept the TDEE rollin'. Got big into meal prepping here, it's saved me so much time and money, and helped teach me to be fiscal.   \nFall was my last term to graduate. Nothing too crazy, more program study work eat sleep. I started the fall off with semi visible abs with a bit o' pump and my arm veins had started being visible. I finished my last college term with a 2.8 (B- average) overall, not my best work but certainly happier than the garbage I had before (Got my degree!). Fall 2016 was my fifth cycle of Lee Haywards program, and from here I started to toss my own accessory days in. I got my waist size 30 at this point.\n\n#Now\n\nThat Jan 30 2017 is me now. I ended up averaging losing 1.5lbs a week for nearly two straight years up to the fall of 2016. Now I just gotta deal with learning how to eat again (Real food is has too much volume....)\n\nReally that's it. I want to thank /r/fitness, /r/BTFC, and all the friends and family that have helped me get here. It's been a wild ride, one that helped me steer my life back together.\n\nFor anybody reading this who's trying to do something similar. The most important thing about losing it is you're worth it.

Well I actually started in high school but I don't really count that since it was mostly my friends and I talking in the gym lol. Anyways right now I'm weighing in at around 165lbs at 5'11. \n\n\nMy routines have bounced around quite a bit, when I was first starting out I would constantly change my routine to whatever the coolest celebrity was doing at the time but when I wasn't doing that I had a push, pull, skip leg day split(bad idea). \nWhen I finally smartened up I did the strong lifts 5x5 routine (I was about 185lbs, mostly belly) I did it for a while but not exactly sure how long I did it but long enough to see some progress. I then moved onto the PHUL routine, it was pretty cool but during both of those workout routines I was eating like shit. Like I would eat everything, it was bad. \n\n\nAround July of last year I injured my shoulder pretty bad and took a few weeks off so that stalled some progress.  \n\n\nAround last ~~January~~ May I was preparing for a police fitness test so I started doing a lot more cardio and I started eating healthier because I saw I was starting to get my abs back! (Woo!). As soon as I started seeing myself become leaner it got me motivated to hit the gym everyday. I really owe everything to having a clean diet. So from that time I started doing my current routine(See below!) and this is where I am now!\n\n\nThis Progress photo was from a few days ago: [Skin, Skinny Fat, Fit pictures](https://www.instagram.com/p/BFZOzNXod89/?taken-by=alihussein3&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;hl=en)\n\n1st skinny: 130-140lbs ish \n2nd skinny fat: 170-185lbs ish at my peak I was 185 I believe \n3rd fit: 165lbs \n\n\nThe front and back photos are from about two months ago, I've mostly made strength gains since but there might be a bit of a difference. \n\n\n[Back](http://imgur.com/to87w8K)\n[Front](http://imgur.com/ZvgQOxb)\n\n\nDiet wise, nothing is really set in stone about how many times I eat or when. I just eat and snack but I make sure it has little to no sugar . I also try to eat as much protein as possible.  I eat lots of fish and chicken. Snack/desert wise: I usually take a whole banana or two and lather that hell out of them with peanut butter. Sometimes I slip up and eat a ton of something sugary but I usually forget about it while I stuff my face with whatever I\u2019m eating.\nAnyways moral of this blurb was to say that I just try to eat as clean as possible when I can and the only thing I really count is my protein intake. I really do plan to start counting the rest of my macros but I plan to do that when/if I decide I want to start bulking up again.\n\n\nSo here is my routine. It's a three day split, back-tri, chest-bi, legs shoulders with cardio and abs in between workout days, if that makes sense lol.

Sick of being a pie I needed to get some sort of routine back in my life. I was aiming to add in a daily exercise that would improve my core and upper body fitness. I decided to choose the press up after watching [this video very informative video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dF1DOWzf20&ab_channel=AntranikDotOrg)\n\n**Main/routine**\nI began by finding my max for close grip press ups which was 18. I then tried to think of a number to do that was high enough to be challenging but not too high that I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. I chose 200, scientific, I know. \n\nI would do these press ups at some point in the day, usually before bed. If I ever missed a day for whatever reason id do 400 the next day. This only happened one or two times but I was determined not to let myself give up. \n\nOn top of these press ups I would be doing cycling now and then (I live in Scotland and its pretty dreich a lot of the time), occasional running. I also began doing circuits twice a week on Tuesdays and Saturday, and boxing on Thursday. With a high impact intensity session on Saturday morning. Id often be doing gym work on Mondays and Fridays.\n\nAs I became better at the press ups I started to add in some of them declined. This was to keep them challenging. At the moment im now doing them in 4 sets of 50 with the last two decline. Whereas at the beginning id be doing them regular in sets of 10. \n\n**Diet**\n\nMy diet varied quite a lot over the 3 months. As I learned more about what to eat and what not to eat I gradually stopped drinking fizzy drinks and I cut alcohol away down, which is difficult being a Scottish student where an apple cider is recognised as one of your 5-a-day. \n\nFor breakfast I typically have cereal such as Weetabix or granola.\n\nLunch id normally have a sandwich or soup. The sandwich usually having either spicy chicken or tuna sweetcorn. Or I\u2019d have a homemade banana milkshake. ( milk, one banana, protein peanut butter, porridge oats, and one scoop whey protein) \n\nFor Dinners, id usually have meat for dinner in the form of a stir fry, chili, bolognaise, fajitas or a roast. Near me I can get fish, venison and pheasants fairly cheap so id usually have something like that with a lot of vegetables. \n\n**Data**\n\nSo as far as progression goes: \n\n* Starting max for press up was 18. Ending max is now 130 (*On a good day*. i managed 120 this morning but the form from about 80 onwards was pretty bad)\n\n* Starting max plank was 58s. Ending max plank is 2m34s.\n\n* Starting weight 72kg/158.7lbs. Ending weight 64kg/141.1lbs\n\n* I can now do 10 wall assisted hand stand press ups!\n\n* I can now do a 10 second tucked L sit!\n\n**Findings**\n\nIve found a daily routine like this to be massively beneficial both physically and mentally. Im very pleased that I had the perseverance to stick to doing this for three months and im also very happy with how it has improved my body physically. The sense of achievement I have gotten from this, even although compared to some of the other things I see here daily has been massive. \nId also say that I learned a massive amount. Doing exercise like this daily kept me thinking about it and over the course of the three months ive read and learned so much and this community (r/bodyweightfitness and r/fitness) has been fantastic for providing information. \n\n**Next steps.**\n \nI think my next steps will be to adapt this to add in more variety in exercise. I\u2019d really like to be able to L sit and for now that will be my next short term goal. Long term I\u2019d love to get more into bodyweight stuff. I\u2019d love to be able to muscle up, hand stand press up and perform a full L sit.\n\nI hope this post can provide some motivation for those who may need it. Although it isn\u2019t exactly a well thought out routine, I feel the main take-away should be that if you put the effort in you can achieve that change you want in your life. \n\n**tl/dr** did exercise, got fitter. \n\n**EDIT: As ive pointed out towards the end of my routine section, these press ups are supplementary to other exercises. I am fully aware that doing this every day isn't perfect but i felt it may be interesting to share this story with this forum.**", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "What 3 Months of daily push ups did to me (M/64KG/170cm/20y/o)", "post_ups": 2095, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3uzy9z/what_3_months_of_daily_push_ups_did_to_me/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:16.859082", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "hatts", "post_created_utc": 1388773635.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "1ubsaa", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 643, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2104, "post_selftext": "In honor of the new year I thought I'd address what I consider to be one of the most limiting misconceptions for newbies.

Also went to a gym, but not really taking it to serious at the time. After moving to another city 2 years ago I had a gym directly next to me. So half a year later I started to get a membership there and workout for real. At this time I haven't worked out or did any sport for 3/4 years. So my journey began 1 1/2 years ago. I pretty much went to the gym 6-7 times a week. Also took a closer look at my food and nutrition.\n\n\n-----\n\n>Workout:\n\nI tried a lot of different workout Routines but the one I liked the most is definitely the upper body/lower body split. Since I am training 2 hours a day this leaves me with enough time to hit each muscle group thus each muscle group gets trained 3 times a week. \n\nSo I alternate between day 1 and day 2. \n\n>Day 1 (Upper Body):  Chest, back, shoulders and arms (Sometimes neck or whatever you feel like)\n\nChest/Back: I give myself 60 min to train chest and back. I do 2 exercises for each with a total of 7-9 sets. I do 2 exercises with different grip or angel. For example normal bench and incline or normal bench and flys or deadlift and face pulls or rows with elbows close to your torso and row with elbows more flared out. I always switch things up so one day I am starting with back and on another day I will start with chest. Sometimes I will do supersets of back and chest. Also try to do more heavy sets at the beginning and towards the end going up to 20 reps (I like to fatigue on my last set with dropsets).\n\nShoulders: I give myself 30 min to train those. Every second upper body day I will train my front delt otherwise I will skip it since it has enough stimulation through chest exercises. For the front delt I do military press with dumbbells, barbells or machine. For the other two delts I like to train with higher reps and also use super or dropsets. Lateral raises are really good for the mid delts (??^^) and for the rear delt just lean a bit forward while doing lateral raises. I really like using a resistance band during the end and really fatiguing the muscle.\n\nArms: I give myself 30 min for those. If the rest of the workout took a bit longer than I will do a superset to save some time. I actually really like using supersets on biceps and triceps as it gives you an insane pump. In general I get 1 exercise of 5 sets for biceps and triceps. So take a different exercise each day and also try to start with biceps and the next time with triceps.\n\nIf you feel like you can add some shrugs at the end of the workout or something for your forearms if those are a weakpoint.\n\n>Day 2 (Lower Body): Quads, hamstrings, calves and abs.\n\nI always start with 5 sets of squats. I try to stay between 12-15 reps. If I feel like it I will go for some heavy squats. After that I will 3 sets of stiffed deadlifts (try here to really focus on the hamstring). Then 4 sets of lag extension and leg curls. After that I will include some adductor/abductor machines depending on time left. For calves I  do about 6 sets and do 3 of them standing and 3 of the seated. Finish the workout with 15-30 min abs, whatever I feel like doing. \n\nDuring my cut I stared every second leg day with 30 min cardio on a bike. \n\n-----\n\n>Nutrition:\n\nBulk: Ate about 4000 calories, at one point as much as 4500.\n\nMeal 1: Oats with  raisins and cinnamon whey protein and some water.\n\nSnack: 150g nuts.\n\nMeal 2: Chicken with rice and some greens.\n\nMeal 3: Tuna and some bananas. \n\nMeal 4: Low fat quark with protein.\n\n-----\n\nCut: Went from 4000 calories to 2500. Lowering it about 500 each week.\n\nMeal 1: Oats with  raisins and cinnamon whey protein and some water.\n\nSnack: 100g nuts.\n\nMeal 2: Chicken. \n\nMeal 3: Tuna.\n\nMeal 4: Low fat quark with protein.\n\n\n \n------\n\nDefinitely had a lot of ups and downs and moments where I felt like I was going nowhere. Just stick to it and it gonna pay of at the end. Its hard seeing your body change if you see yourself every day. A German quote is: \"The route is the goal.\" So try to enjoy working out.\n\n-----\n\n>Supplements:\n\nWhey Protein\n\nCreatin\n\nBCAA's (during cut, right before workout)\n\nL-Glutamin\n\nPre-Workout\n\nMulti Vitamin\n\nOmega 3\n\n-------\n\n>Things I learned:\n\nEating enough is key!!\n\nWorking out consistently is really important.\n\nTry new things and don't get caught up in the stuff you do.\n\nWhen it gets hard that's when it really matters to stick to it.\n\n-----\n\nThere is a lot of unnecessary things that improve your results by so little and people get caught up trying to perfect those. 90% of it is consistent hard work in the gym and eating enough. Don't focus too much on the rest and try to enjoy your journey! :)\n\n-----\n\nThanks for reading.

After talking to him about losing weight I started eating healthier for a month with low carb and lost 10lbs. I was so excited I got hooked finally on losing weight and started my journey.\nBefore/After:\nhttp://imgur.com/NhhLVtX\nShirtless comparisons:\nhttp://imgur.com/5Gcgm8P\n\n\nThis is what I did:\nDIET:\nAt the start all I did was make healthier decisions, ex. grilled chicken wrap/burger instead of a cheeseburger. \n\nAfter that began to get difficult, and cravings started to return (I was straight up addicted to food)\nI began tracking calories with MyFitnessPal, I started out at 1800 calories a day (which now I realise was a little low)\nLater bumped calories up to 2000, today I am at 2200.\nToday I also track macro nutrients.\n\nTRAINING:\nI started out doing the typical 5 day bro split, and for a beginner I found it to work very well.\nI didn't do much cardio at the start because it honestly hurt alot to do anything then walk, so usually I would just walk for 5 minutes to warm up before my weight training regiment.\n\n\nNow that I have been lifting for a year I have started incorporating a PPL split. With heavy compound movements and hypertrophy isolation movements. I also try and do 20 minutes of cardio a day.\n\nHow I have stayed motivated?\nI tracked all of my progress on instagram which was huge for me to keep myself accountable and on track. If I stopped I felt like I would let my followers down. So that helped me alot\nAs well as having my coworker around to suggest things to eat etc.\nOnce I got over the initial hurdle of the addiction to crappy food, it became very easy.\nFlexible dieting is probably my biggest help, it allows me to eat as clean as possible but also eat something I'm craving if I want. Its way more sustainable imo then anything else.\n\nWhat are my goals today?\nIm on my way to 175lb or 10-15% bf, before I start my lean bulk.\nMy goal is to compete in 1-2 years in either physique or bodybuilding, unsure of which.\nMy biggest goal is to motivate people that are struggling with losing weight.

About 6 months ago I was 180lbs:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gI5ppRe\n\nTonight, I hit my goal of 145lbs:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/ahkO0Zo\n\nI don't lift, which is probably noticeable in the picture. Instead I decided to finally take a Jiu Jitsu class, signed up, and have been doing that 4 days a week consistently for 6 months. I didn't start watching what I eat until this past Jan, when I was 170lbs, which reinforces the common wisdom that diet makes the bigger difference. I didn't strictly count calories, instead I glanced at calorie estimations for whatever I planned on eating, and tried to keep it around 1200/day, not caring too much if I'm +/- 200. Hardest part was cutting back on beer, as I'm one of those annoying beer snobs that homebrews.\n\nJiu Jitsu was something I always knew I'd like, as I've been a huge MMA fan for a while now. I dragged my feat to join it, however, with the excuse that I wanted to get in shape first before trying it - that was flawed logic. I regret this now as my Dad shared my love for MMA, and he signed up for BJJ a few years back. He passed in August at 57, having competed in his first BJJ tournament the January before (while on chemo, the crazy SOB). I signed up 1 month later, and now will never get the opportunity to roll with him. Strange as it sounds, I'd give anything right now to be able to throw my dad to the ground and strangle him.\n\nSo lessons learned - get up and do it, before it's too late.\n\nNow that I hit my goal weight, I'd like to bring some strength training in the mix.

Never swim after drinking alcohol the same day.**\n* If you are planning more than one or two minute dip, then bring\u00a0plenty of warm clothes for afterwards.\n\n**BEFORE THE SWIM**\n\n* Put some money in the charity collection. Christmas is shit for many people. Those of us fortunate to have this luxury might remember this. \n*Do NOT stand around talking\u00a0once you are changed into your swimsuit, allowing your temperature to drop. Get the water.\n* It's NORMAL\u00a0to be NERVOUS of Cold Water. Increased heart rate is common.\n* Wear sandals as close to the water's edge as possible.\n* **DO NOT DIVE IN**. Expert swimmers actually enter more slowly.\u00a0Just don't do it. I don't care how tough you think you are. Unless you are a very experienced cold water swimmer this is a dumb thing to do. \n* SPLASH WATER on your face before immersion to allow your breathing to slow.\n* It's not a competition. Stay clear and watch everything. * Depending on your location there may be lots of people who don't know what they are doing in the water that day.\n* Just as you get in ... tell yourself it's warm. It doesn't matter if you hear the sucking sound of body parts rapidly shrinking inwards.\u00a0Cold water swimming is partially about mental attitude. Tell yourself it's actually better than you thought: \"*Hell, it's almost warm. I was worried about this*\"?\n\n**DURING THE SWIM**\n\n* Stay Calm. You can float at the start top allow your heart rate to decrease.\n* Cold stimulates the gasp reflex through increased heart rate. * After the initial 10 seconds extreme shock, it still makes breathing difficult for the next three minutes. This is also normal. It's why you splash water on your face and get in slowly.\n* Once you start swimming, it's best to keep swimming and not stop.\n\n* **Have a great time**.\n\n**EXITING THE WATER**\n\n* Watch your exit. Be careful. This is when most injuries occur.\u00a0Cold = numb feet = lacerations = more blood than you'd expect.\n* Get your footwear on immediately and get to your clothes and get dressed immediately.

Many people offered to send samples and I selected some. Yesterday and today after couple hours of work I finished the measurements. \n\n**[Here are the results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag9uT-E4EIL7dFZPZnR0WVZybGtFWnRKNzdKNm9XOVE#gid=0)**\n\nMy interpretation: I haven't measured any powder as 100% accurate. The reason probably is that none of it dissolved in water as good as my BSA standard. I gave a subjective solubility score to each. For example many chocolate flavored powders left a debris that looks like cacao, I gave them score of 4. Plant based powders didn't dissolve at all so got solubility score of 1 and obviously had low readings which doesn't mean anything. I guess they are just plant powders not isolated proteins. \n\nBrandwise, Optimum Nutrition looks very reliable to me. Gaspari and Body Fortress are suspicious and deserves another independent measurement. The others are OK, remember that solubility is important and 75% reading might just be attributable to that. Finally, **stay away from American Pure Whey**.\n\nBitcoin donations are welcome: 14Gy12JvWG43ft56ckfLVAyBNz6frwgwzX\n\n**EDIT:** For those of you who are suspicious of APW results, check out the [previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/tcpmt/american_pure_whey_is_american_pure_shit/) that inspired this one. They did not find any protein either.\n\n**EDIT:** Thanks for the bitcoin donations. I'll turn them into caffeine, that into science and hopefully that into more broscience.\n\n**EDIT:** For those of you who are curious here is the [photo of the plate](http://imgur.com/QvDLy,almHo#0) and [my standard curve](http://imgur.com/QvDLy,almHo#1).\n\n**EDIT:** As pointed out by the submitter MyProtein has a fine print that says cocoa in chocolate flavored protein makes the actual protein content %8 less than the unflavored one. We measured the chocolate version so I adjusted the claimed protein per serving from 19.6g to 18g. This pushed the reading to 90%.\n\n**EDIT:** No, I'm not taking any more submissions. If I plan I'll post another call. In the meantime are there any other gym-rat/lab-rat that wants to take over?\n\n**EDIT:** There has been very valuable suggestions in the comments by people who are more experienced than me in the lab. If anyone wants to do something similar in the future here are some thing we have learned:\n\n* Sonicate your samples\n\n* Try to find a research grade whey/casein standard from a reputable brand\n\n* Seek for alternative assays (total nitrogen, Kjeldahl, HPLC etc.)\n\n* If you are going to add detergent (which I didn't), make sure that your assay is compatible with that.\n\n**EDIT:** Gaspari posted an [official response](http://www.gasparinutrition.com/news/articleview.aspx?ArticleID=276).\n\n**FINAL EDIT: I would like to add one last comment. This experimentation created thousands of comments around the net, especially in bb.com forums. Many people raised concerns about the testing methods, many raised concerns about Gaspari products. I want to state that I know me doing this is ridiculous. But it is not ridiculous because my testing method has a large margin of error (of course it does) but because I am the only one in the world that does this. Please reflect on the status quo rather than single outing Gaspari. Here is a billion dollar industry and no qualified third party is doing a comparative analysis and customers don't seem to care. Can you imagine a world where CPUs and GPUs are not benchmarked? Of course some benchmarking methods are flawed or not suitable for certain products but that is not the point. Somebody should do it and it had to start somewhere. Let's push places like Cosumer Reports, large fitness websites or magazines to do this properly. I hope my effort can raise enough awareness.

For the first year, I stuck with a very basic 3-day gym split:\n\n* Monday: chest and tris \n* Wednesday: back, bis, and shoulders on \n* Friday: legs \n\nI did this for about one year.  During this time, I was the typical gym bro.  Very little knowledge about what I was doing. Doing half reps for most exercises in order to lift as much weight as I possibly could.  Spending 2 hours at the gym on chest days. 30 min at the gym on leg days.  But during this year, I put on about 20lbs.  This was primarily due to my diet, which ill go over later.  My lifts at this time were: \n\n* Bench: 95lbs\n* Squat: 135lbs\n* Deadlift: 155lbs \n\nAfter about a year of doing this, I decided it was time to switch it up and start hitting the gym more than 3 days week.  I switched up my routine to the following:\n\n* Monday: Chest\n* Tuesday: Back\n* Thursday: Shoulders and arms\n* Friday: Legs\n\nI followed this regimen for about 2 years.  While I was doing this, I learned to lift with correct form, but at the same time I was lifting inconsistently.  After my initial gains at the gym, I lost the motivation and intensity at the gym that I once had.  I would go consistently for about 2-3 months, but then just stop going out of the blue for about 2-3 weeks. My training schedule during this time would consistently fluctuate.  I would focus on powerlifting for a little while, but then a couple weeks later I\u2019d go back to bodybuilding and wanting to look better.  My diet was still fairly consistent though, so I kept making weight gains, but they were not optimal due to my inconsistent workout patterns. \n\nFast forward to now.  At the beginning of this year I went through some tough times, and took all of my emotions from that and directed them towards the gym.  This tremendously helped me regain my passion for the gym.  I changed up my training style, intensity, and number of days that I trained. In this year alone, I have put on close to 15lbs, and have made strength gains that I haven\u2019t seen since my 1-2 years of lifting. This is what a normal week at the gym looks like now: \n\n* Monday \u2013 Legs (quads) (squat day)\n* Tuesday \u2013 Push (bench day)\n* Wednesday \u2013 Pull \n* Thursday \u2013 Upper body (military press day)\n* Friday \u2013 Legs (hamstrings and glutes) (deadlift day)\n \nMy view on training now is not to focus solely on powerlifiting or bodybuilding, but to incorporate both into my training.  This has definitely worked the best for me.  I want to be strong.  But I also want to look good. In my earlier years, as soon as I would start to focus on one goal, I would start longing for the other.  By incorporating both training styles into my regime, I have really enhanced not only my physique and strength, but I am also more consistent with my training due to the fact that I focus on both of my goals at the same time. \n\nUsing this approach, a quad day might look like this for me: \n\n- Back Squat 5x5 \n- Negative Back Squats 3x3 (http://instagram.com/p/vmFBrfjvLb/)\n- 1.5 Squats 3x10 (http://instagram.com/p/vTiE4WjvIx/) \n- Leg Press 3x15-20\n- Leg Extension 3x15-20\n\nAs you can see above, I start off my workout by lifting heavier weights.  The beginning of the workout is to focus on my strength, and getting used to the feel of heavy weights on my back.  As I progress through my workout, my focus then turns to inducing growth in the muscle by using higher reps, and focusing on contracting the muscle like a bodybuilder, rather than just moving the weight. \n\nRelating to strength, one of the most important things that I learned this year is that a bigger muscle has more potential to move more weight. That should be common sense, right?  When I used to focus solely on powerlifting, I only trained using lower rep ranges thinking that these are the only ones that will allow me to get stronger over time.  I completely ignored higher rep ranges.  This resulted in little growth of the muscles I was using, which in turn leads to stagnated strength gains.  By incorporating higher rep ranges along with lower rep ranges, not only are you increasing your strength, but you are also increasing your potential for strength by increasing the size of that muscle. \n\nMy best lifts to date are:\n\n* Bench: 285\n* Squat: 385\n* Deadlift: 455\n\n**DIET**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAs you guys can probably tell from my pictures, I am an ectomorph.  My metabolism is extremely fast and I find it fairly difficult to gain weight.\n\nMy diet has not changed too much from when I first started lifting.  The only major difference is the amount of calories I take in now.\n\nWhen I first joined a gym I was very determined to gain weight, and I tried to eat everything in my path.  My diet was very dirty.  I would eat a lot of fast food and buy food based on its caloric content.  I think I was hitting about 3000 calories a day at this point, which was a lot for me then, being a 125lb guy. \n\nCurrently, I try to take in around 3500-4000 calories a day.  At this number, I usually put on 1-2lbs a month.  My sources of food are a lot cleaner now than they were before. I try to limit my fast food consumption to as little as possible.  Yes, I would put on weight a lot faster eating calorie dense fast food meals, but I have become a lot more health conscious.  Gaining weight/looking good doesn\u2019t mean you are healthy.  I want my organs to be in good shape as well as my physical appearance.  Eating fast food won\u2019t benefit that cause.  \n\nI am very fortunate in the sense that I can be very loose with my diet and still stay fairly lean, especially when a lot of people have to diet very hard and track all of their macronutrients to look the way they want to.  But this is a double-edged sword because it is very difficult for me to gain weight.  I\u2019m always lean, but gaining weight is a slow and expensive process for me. \n\n**SUPPLEMENTS**\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhen I first started, all I took was a weight gaining protein powder.  I would have about one serving a day (totalling about 1000 calories).  This really helped me put on my initial weight.\n\nNowadays, all I take is a whey protein powder, a multivitamin, and fish oil.  Yes, I still want to gain weight, but I really don\u2019t like weight gainers.  First reason is that a lot of them are full of a lot of garbage.  They have a lot of sugar and empty calories in them.  Secondly, I would always feel bloated and very sluggish after drinking them.  I prefer to make my own shakes at home now.  Ill usually mix a scoop of chocolate protein powder with milk, a banana, and a lot of peanut butter.\n\nI used to use creatine, and I usually do see about 1-2lbs of weight gain and a slight increase in energy when I am on it.  I haven\u2019t been consistent with use of it though.  I like to keep my use of supplements as low as possible, and I just don\u2019t see creatine as something I really need.\n\nI used pre workouts for the first time this past summer because I was working at a factory, and I needed the extra energy to make it to the gym.  Yeah, they gave me a big boost in energy, but I\u2019m not a fan of them at all.  First reason is because they aren\u2019t the greatest thing to ingest health wise.  Second reason is I found myself becoming reliant on them.  After I finished working at the factory, I stopped taking them, and I found that my energy at the gym was a lot lower. I didn\u2019t feel like my mind was in right place.  It was a mental thing though, and after a week of not taking pre workout, I was back to normal. \n\n\n\n\nEDIT: For everyone asking for my **current workout schedule**, its posted here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2np3lb/my_transformation_from_125lbs_to_175lbs/cmflsl2\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "My transformation from 125lbs to 175lbs", "post_ups": 2049, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2np3lb/my_transformation_from_125lbs_to_175lbs/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:16.859082", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "abraxsis", "post_created_utc": 1497987114.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1498145071.0, "post_gilded": 2, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 2, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "6ige1j", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 124, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2049, "post_selftext": "EDIT 2: It's Thurs post surgery. Surgery went well, and the doctors surprisingly tightened my abdominal muscles too. Something that wasn't on the schedule of events. Which is cool, but sheer agony. I've heard mothers who have had tummy tuck aliken the muscle repair as worse than child birth. If that's true, I have the utmost respect for women in that aspect. And having a strong core just makes it that much worse when it pulls on the stitches in there. \n\nI did have some complications, syncope (passing out) from the pain, blood loss and being generally dehydrated. They kept me in the hospital, where I am posting from now. I'm not sure if I'll be getting out today or tomorrow, but my surgeon assures me it's a not completely uncommon after effect given the sheer magnitude of the surgery. Pain is bad if I'm moving, but tolerable if I'm sitting still. I got to see the surgeons work this morning when they came in to check on me. Even as swollen as I am I completely flabbergasted how thin my midsection is. When I seen it I was literally moved to tears, that this pain was hopefully the landmark event that I've been working a decade to get too. All the pain I've endured, the depression that eventually comes with being so controlling over your diet, and even the ridicule of all those people back when I was fat. All of those things, plus many other things and other people had their part in this, even many of you in this board, through sharing your experiences and your knowledge helped me and who know how many others who haven't came forward. Take a moment this weekend and thank someone who has helped to get you where you are today, whether that place is swole, healed, or even just alive and happy. There is great value in just a little gratitude. \n\nEDIT: It's 4:57am 6/21 here, surgery day. I'm up and prepping to head to the hospital (it's an 1.5 hours away) so messages after this time won't get responded to till afterwards, maybe Thursday when Im coherent. I tried to respond to as many as I could this morning since I couldn't sleep. For all those who are struggling and see this post as inspirational or motivational, you CAN win this part of your life. Of all the garbage and nastiness in this world, the curveballs life throws you during your time spent here living and breathing, your weight is something you CAN control. Believe that, trust that, and live that. Use my story as a stepping stone on the path to your own story's end. Every single one of you reading this can make it happen, I believe it, but you need to believe that too, you only have to start. I wish you all the same luck that you have wished me. \n\n**Just-Show-me-the-Photos-Dammit Edition...**\n\nSo, people last time asked if I would ever really show all the loose skin I had in photos. \u200b[\u200bWell, here it is, with some background shots. Feast your eyes upon all it's nasty sagging.\u200b](http://imgur.com/a/DkSZM)\u200b (Yes, I know it's not as bad as others, but it still has caused me a lot of physical and psychosocial issues.) The reason I am putting this up is that tomorrow morning it's getting sliced off. Gone. It's taking a long walk off a short pier, sleeping with the fishes, etc.\n\nSome might also comment on there being fat under the skin, yes there is some. However, I have had 2 doctors tell me it has reached a point of \"maintenance\" where I would have to lower my calories too far to try and lose the amount of fat left under it. I was also told the skin is thicker than it normally would be in some places, thinner in others. I assume this is from the body trying to support it, fighting the tissue breakdown?\n\n**TL;DWTR (aka I've got 2 minutes, fill me in):**\n\nSome might remember my story of hitting 200lbs of weight lost from just after the first of the year. As of this morning, I am sitting at a comfortable ~194lbs @ 6'2\". This is the smallest I have been since I was about 13, maybe 14. The weight loss and journey was long, but enlightening. But, the loose skin has been horrible, I have hated it. \n\nIn a weird turn of events, my regular doc sent me to a plastic surgeon at a teaching hospital in another city, a VERY well respected one. She warned me that it could take months to get approved and to even see if the insurance would cover it due to some medical issues. \n\nThat's when the whirlwind started ... The surgeon approved me for surgery that day and had his surgical coordinator deal with the insurance. They went on vacation for 2 weeks and told me they would get back to me when they got back. First day back I called ... then the bomb dropped ... approved and 100% covered ... surgery in 3 weeks.\n\nTomorrow morning I'll be traveling an 1.5hr to the hospital and by day's end I will be rid of this skin. Is it weird that I'm looking forward to being able to take my shirt off at the beach for the first time in decades ... or jump rope/anything plyo-based without feeling like my skin is going to peel off?\n\nBelow is an abbreviated backstory, the original is still [available here](https://ap.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5lioa6/m3862_4078_2072_200lbs_weight_loss/) and the second [update is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5wpxhb/update_goal_reached_m3862_4078_1996lbs_2082lbs/)\n\u200b\n\n*****************************************\n*****************************************\n\n**The Whole Enchilada**\n\n**Quick Background:**\n\n\u200bWhen I was a kid I was told I would never be fat. By the time I graduated from High School I was ~320lbs. My Junior year of college I moved to main campus, weighing about 390, and reached 400+ by end of the 1st year on campus. Second year on campus was when I reached my max of 407.8lbs. It is likely that I weighed more, but the 407.8 figure is the highest I found logged by a medical office, so it is the one I use.\n\n**Side Note:** Early November 2016, I hurt my shoulder. Small labrum tear, non-displaced, so it will heal. But then I hurt my knee focusing on legs while I rehabbed shoulder. Both are getting better now, which has slowed down my weight loss as I am refocusing on lifting again.\n\n*****************************************\n*****************************************\n\n**Diet:** \n\nAs I stated in my last submission, I have been on all of the options at some point. Low-fat is where I started, then moved to high-protein for a stretch. I adhered to a strict ketogenic diet for nearly 3 years. For the last year and a half I have stuck to IIFYM, which is, in my humble opinion, the best out of the options.\n\nSince the shoulder injury, I have been on a continuous cut. I've been doing a crazy, but effective, 1600-1700 calorie/day diet that is heavy on protein to help maintain lean mass. Myprotein BCAAs 2x a day and no other supplements, not even protein powder, but when I do get some it is usually myprotein or ON brand.\n\nI never use pre-workout.\n\n*****************************************\n*****************************************\n\n**Exercise:** \n\nMy approach to fitness is functional with a heavy slant on looking good. I want to just look like the classic \"male.\" I used to think that due to some former fat-guy issues I couldn't deadlift, so I always did rack pulls instead. But, through serious effort working with a physical therapist and form coach, I pulled 2 plates (225lbs) yesterday for the first time. I also did a 2 minute plank, the longest in my life.\n\nI'll be able to squat again soon, but it will be basically from square one.\n\nAs for bench, I prefer incline over flat, before the injury my PR was 2 sets of 5 at 185lbs. I'm basically starting over, currently at 105lbs 4x10 on a good shoulder day, less on a bad one.\n\nWhen lifting regularly I run a 6 day split. \n\n* Monday is Chest / Back \n* Tuesday is Core / Legs \n* Weds is Triceps / Biceps \n* Thursday is Back II\n* Friday is Shoulders / Core\n* Sat is Legs. \n* Sun is Rest Day\n\nI felt my resting heart rate was getting too low (sometimes as low as 42 bpm) so I have discontinued most cardio for the time being.\n\nI also hike when I can and I like to swim.\n\n*****************************************\n*****************************************\n\n\u200b**Whats Next:**\n\nThis question is the thing I am still working on. I have hit my goals with weight loss, but I also have 6-8 weeks of recovery from surgery I have coming.\n\n*****************************************\n*****************************************\n\n**FAQ**\n\n* Are you going to lose any more weight?\n\n>After the surgery I plan to maintain a hypo-caloric (although not as hard core to facilitate healing) for a few months as there is some additional fat store to lose, but not much.\n\n\n* So you have loose skin? So what?\n\n>If I felt that no one would ever judge me on my skin, emotionally I would be just fine with keeping it. However, it is physically painful. If I jump down from somewhere more than 1-2 feet high the skin \"bouncing\" causes a quick, painful, tearing sensation, especially adjacent to the stretch marks/scars. Doing jumping jacks and jumping rope is impossible for more than 5-10 seconds at a time and even the elliptical machine can get painful without doubling up on compression shirts. I have physically got the skin that is hanging down caught in doors and drawers when I happen to be shirtless. Where it hangs over my pants/underwear, it will often get raw unless I am actively keeping it dry or wearing compression wear. Also, I seem to have lots of ingrown hairs on my lower torso where the skin in stretched thinnest. They create small white heads that I have to pop or they could get infected or get much larger. One two occasions at the end of last summer, in the same skin fold, small boils formed that I had to lance and drain. So while there is a mental/emotional aspect of wanting to have the skin removed, there is a very real physical aspect.\n\n\n* Did you have surgery or use any drugs/medicine/chemicals?\n\n>\u200bNo. Nothing. Not against them, I just feel the \"quick\" (clearly not painless) methods available lack a certain educational value to them. Sure, I can teach someone the techniques to keep off the 100lbs they lost from weight loss surgery, but actually living it for years, dealing with failures/obstacles, is nearly always the best teacher.\n\n* Do you do anything weight loss related with your experience?\n\n>I am currently a non-practicing psychotherapist/counselor, as I was in the last submission. BUT, that is looking like it might change soon. A local sports/physical therapy team are beginning a wellness program that looks at overall fitness from a holistic approach. It is a multi-disciplinary team and I have been approached to head up the mental health aspect and was told I was a perfect candidate since not only do I have the required license/education, I have first hand experience. They are also willing to accommodate me on time needed for the skin removal surgery if I were to be able to get it later this year.\n\n* Did you ever get anything from your weight loss?\n\n>Other than what will hopefully be an extra 20-30 years of life? Yeah. After the last submission, an anonymous person sent me a $150 gift card for Under Armour, via an anonymous email, to my email address which I assume they doxxed. I was incredibly moved by the gift. The note that came with the gift card numbers simply said, \"Save this for your ultimate goal since it won't be long, or spend it now ... either way, get something good, you deserve it.\" If you read this, mysterious benefactor, thank you. I have kept it and made plans to head to an Under Armour outlet once I am able. I truly appreciate it.\n\n* What's next?\n\n>I'd like to climb a mountain. Maybe Mt. Elbert or Rainier?\u200b Something with proper snow and requires a bit of technical climbing.\u200b I'v\u200be \u200balways been a bit of an armchair mountaineer. \n\n* Did you ever consider suicide?\n\n>I put this on every update I do, or anything I post connected with weight loss. The answer is yes I have, on a few occasions, not my finest moments. **If you are considering suicide, PLEASE get help, there are lots of options for help, regardless of where you are in the world. You might think suicide will stop what you are currently feeling, but it also robs you of everything you could be. In the US you can call 1-800-273-8255, 911, or go to the nearest Emergency Room.

(woooo) Anyways, last year before xmas me and my then girlfriend split up. Instead of moping about, a buddy and I hit the gym and I kept going. I'm not here for pity ex-gf points so here is what I did to lose some fat.\n\n**DIET:**\nFirst off, I was not willing to give up all bad food, this all would have gone faster if I did, but food rocks. I cut out chips and pop. Then every other week I'd cut something else out of my diet (a certain type of fast food, a type of candy, ect..)\n\nThen about 4 months later, I let myself have most of those things back but is massive moderation. I mostly graze eat now, but healthier things. Eating some carrots as I write this. The short of it, I ate less crap, and then eventually just less over all. Looking back, I can't believe how crappy, and how much crap I ate.\n\nFor a while I tried counting calories. I was following a strict 1800 to start, and lowered it to 1600 when I reached 180LB. Now I just sorta count, and shoot for around 1400 cal, but don't beat myself up if I go over.\n\n**Workout:**\nI didn't really follow something too strict. For the first 2 months my friends and I had no idea what we were doing. We did 40 minutes of some type of cardio each gym visit, followed by lifting a muscle group. We used a random workout we found online.\n\nAfter that I had some health problems, and could not lift so I did just cardio. I'd go about 4-6 times a week and would do an hour of elliptical. I could not go running due to a knee issue. (Which is now resolved.) Sometimes it would bug me, but no pain no gain right?\n\nAfter a while I got back into the same old routine. 40 minutes of cardio, followed by lifting. Then I had a massive foot issue. I could hardly do cardio, but pushed through the elliptical after the Dr. said I could, but leg day was put on hold for about 2 months. That sucked. I ended up taking about a month off because I was discouraged.\n\nI eventually got a massive boost of motivation and got my ass into gear. My medical issues were resolved. I started a new workout, and still keep to this one for the time being.\n\nI alternate days of interval training, and cardio+lifting. On interval days I do: 20 minutes on the tread mill at 45 seconds intervals at 5 to 8 mph. Followed by 40 minutes intervals on the stair master at 110 SPM to 130 SPM, 80 second intervals.\n\nOn lifting days I start with 10-20 minutes of light cardio to get warmed up. Then I lift a muscle group. (Back & bi, Chest & Tri, Legs, Shoulders & Core). I don't really follow a workout, I just have a short list in my head that will take about 50-70 minutes to complete, and I do it. I finish up with at least another 30 minutes of cardio.\n\nI wish I could go to the gym twice a day, but ain't nobody got time for that. :(\n\nMy goal is 165LB, then I plan to work on building muscle and reducing my BF%.\n\nFront before and after: http://i.imgur.com/K1dyiKs.jpg\n\nSide before and after: http://i.imgur.com/Kb3q8l9.jpg\n\nEDIT: Just noticed a typo in my title...

My starting weight was only 119lb but (as you can see) I was not in good shape at all. My show date weight was 109lb and my maintenance weight is 111lb. The before pic was 9/21/2015, show date was 3/13/16.\n\n\nYou can clearly see that I am much leaner despite the muscle I put on. I want to be clear that I lift AS HEAVY AS POSSIBLE. In fact, my coach sometimes loads the bar or machine over my normal weight and he spots me while I do the negative. In those cases, I am lifting 25-50lb than I would on my own. I cannot stress enough that you will not get big and bulky from weights. My increased muscle mass actually helps me burn more fat. So anyone (especially female) who is afraid of weights, Please please don't be!\n\n\nMy background: prior to training with a coach, I was your average gym goer. I went about 3 times a week, not really focusing on much, did a few random exercises I had learned over time. Did a little cardio. I was afraid of doing leg exercises because I didn't want big thighs. I had literally never done a squat in my life. But even though I wasn't in bad shape, I wasn't in good shape either. I got tired easily and didn't have the energy or desire to do much outside going to work and hanging out with my kids. I knew my diet wasn't helping. Even though we don't have \"junk food\" in the house, I was a very mindless eater and never kept track of what I ate. I would often eat out of boredom. I knew I needed a change. My personality is very extreme, so I made a goal of competing in a bikini competition and set out to find a coach.\n\n\nAfter meeting my coach and him creating a diet and workout plan, I made such rapid progress that we decided I would compete in Figure and Fitbody instead. I genetically seem to grow and show muscle. I spent 5 months working to get on stage. The photos above were literally taken right before I started training and the others are the day of the show. I won 2nd place Fitbody as a novice in an open class. I plan to compete again as I learned a lot about myself in the process. I want to share those here:\n\n\n1.) Don't be afraid of weights! I explained that above.\n\n2.) Food is fuel. Yes, it is sometimes fun to eat stuff that tastes good, or splurge on occasion. But after measuring and writing my food for 5 months, I can't even imagine going back to just putting a random amount of food on my plate or just grabbing handfuls of stuff and eating it.\n\n3.) Eating right and being physically fit has given me more energy in other areas of my life. Yes! Even when I'm physically exhausted from training, I still have the energy to play and do activities with my kids, go for a hike, try something new like cross-country skiing. Things I would not have had the energy to do before, I want to try. My mind is more energized for work and school. It has permeated all aspects of my life.\n\n4.) No excuses. For a long time I felt I didn't have the time, resources, etc. to get into shape. Yes, I had the luxury of hiring a coach, but I now know all of the things I need to do to continue without him (if I choose). I know I can do this on my own, but I needed him to kickstart my journey. I also blamed genetics for a long time as to why I couldn't achieve a certain look. Again, no excuses, now I know that hard work is all it takes.\n\n\nDiet: my coach created a plan from day 1 after reviewing what I ate normally. He bases his diets on macros, so for the last 5 months I literally have had no idea what I was eating calorie-wise. This really works for me because in the past I have obsessed about calories which isn't good. I started at:\nProtein:171g Carbs:177g Fat:30g. \n\n\nOver time my carbs were cut so I could continue to lose body fat and grow/retain muscle. The week before show I was at 3 low carb days Protein: 190g, Carbs: 86, Fat: 35g, to one high carb day (to keep my metabolism going) Protein: 172g, Carbs: 175g, Fat: 31g. \n\n\nSuffice to say I ate a lot of chicken, broccoli, Greek yogurt, fish, green beans, rice cakes, brown rice and drank 2 protein shakes a day.\n\n\nWorkout: Cardio started at 5 hours a week. After a couple months I was losing weight too quickly so we cut it back to 2.5hours a week. Close to show date we picked it back up to 5 hours. I hate traditional cardio, like a lot of you, so I would mix it up. Running outside or treadmill, Bike, elliptical. On top of that, we stay active as a family: ice skating, hiking, trampoline parks, Ariel park (where you get strapped in and climb in the trees), are only a few examples. \n\n\nOn top of cardio, I lift 4-5 times a week for about an hour. I see my coach twice a week to do one lower body day and one upper body. On my own I would usually do one leg day, shoulders/ back day, chest/arms day. We focused a LOT on my butt/hammies and back/shoulders. I have learned dozens of new exercises that target different muscles in each body part. If you want to see an actual list of exercises, I can post that in the comments.  (If anyone is wondering, I work on-call nights. I have my days free. I get on average 6-8 hours of unbroken sleep a night even with my job.)\n\n\nIn conclusion: It was a lot of hard work and without the support of my husband and kids, as well as my coach, I would not have been able to do it. I don't want to discourage people and have them point out \"But you had the time, money, resources to do it\". Yes, that is true. Working out 10 hours a week isn't feasible for everyone. Not everyone can hire a coach. I can't deny that. But you can make diet changes and improve your workouts on your own. You can make changes that will benefit you for a lifetime. Your health and fitness goals aren't a race. I still had to wake up one day and decide I was going to change my life. There is plenty of great inspiration and advice right here on /r/fitness!\n\n\nEDIT******* I am sorry if I came off deceptive or confusing with the \"heavy lifting\" promotion. I want to be clear that my goals were to compete. Therefore, I only achieved my look with the help of a second person spotting and training with me. My stage BF was 10% which is not sustainable and helps create the muscle definition. My maintenance BF is 14-15% BF which obviously adds fat and softens the look of the muscles. If I worked out on my own and changed my diet, I still would have needed to lift heavier weights to have leaned out and have any definition which is what I think a lot of women are aiming for.\nMaintenance: http://imgur.com/a/ahbZ4 ", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Transformation: Female who completely changed her life by lifting HEAVY! 119lb to 109lb.", "post_ups": 2006, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4ayfc1/transformation_female_who_completely_changed_her/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:16.860087", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "inde_", "post_created_utc": 1520535159.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1520536177.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "82zxep", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 523, "post_num_crossposts": 3, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 2007, "post_selftext": "Really really indepth, it's now broken down per activity type:\n\n**Activity Level**|**Maintenance (healthy weight)**|**Muscle gain (healthy weight)**|**Fat Loss (healthy weight)**|**Fat Loss (overweight)**|**Pregnant**|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\nSedentary|1.2-1.8|n/a|n/a|1.2-1.5|1.66-1.77|\nActive|1.4-2.2|1.4-3.3|2.2-3.3|1.2-1.5|unknown|\n\nNote - this is grams (of protein) per kilogram (of bodyweight).

When I lost the weight originally it was through atkins and tons of cardio, this time I had the power of Reddit in my corner. \n\nSince then all my blood lipid levels are now within healthy range and I have been able to drop three out of four of my asthma medications not to mention the relief of debilitating depression and lack of self esteem. I posted a while back about winning a weight loss competition  http://bit.ly/XOpxhu and you told me to post on my continued progress well I am back to do just that. \n\nMy diet has been aided by the use of myfitnesspal and macronutrient counting. Learning how much my body needs instead of eating whatever I wanted has been a struggle but I am getting better at it all the time. I eat oats in the morning most days. Salmon or chicken is my primary protein source with the occasional whey shake. I also have a cheat meal once a week to keep me sane. Lately I have been eating at a caloric surplus in order to attempt to fill out some of the loose skin with muscle and become more aesthetic. \n\nI have continued to weight train using a traditional bodybuilding split focusing on compound movements at low reps to start each workout and I run. \n\nLifts currently Squat 5 x 275 Bench 5 x 205 Military Press 5 x 115 Deadlift 5 x 315\n\nI also have been practicing traditional Mysore style Ashtanga yoga 6 days a week. Yoga is my main focus lately because the benefits seem to transcend the physical. I practice 6 days a week (except for the new/full moons) in the early morning and I go to a teacher about 90 minutes away from my home in order to learn the practice from a qualified professional. I am only able to afford to do this about once a month. I am currently in a haiku contest to try to win a $200 gift certificate to my favorite yoga studio Moksha Yoga in Chicago if you could throw me a vote it would help me immensely to be able to continue my education in the practice.

I legitimately didn't recognize myself.\n\nOn the left I'm ~355 Lbs, on the right I'm ~200 Lbs.\n\nI still want to lose another ~30 Lbs of fat before I consider stage 1 (massive fat cut) to be complete. So even though this isn't my \"official\" before and after, I'll post some details:\n\n* **Timeframe**: ~15 months. Started cutting December 27th, 2010. The \"after\" photo was taken yesterday.\n\n* **Diet**: Nothing incredibly specific, I just counted calories, and tried to stay high protein and low carb (but I wasn't obsessive about macros by any means). I used www.myfitnesspal.com to track calories. No supplements, no protein powder, just regular food. I haven't eaten fast food once in 15 months and I have no desire to, my tastes have changed and it doesn't even sound good. My girlfriend and I cook all our own healthy meals at home now.\n\n* **Exercise**: I did *some* exercise every single day. I missed a few days obviously with injuries and getting run down after a while, but I never scheduled a single off day for myself. I did a crap load of cardio. I know it's not strictly necessary for losing fat, but it doesn't hurt, and when you're as out of shape as I was you actually need the cardiovascular benefits. I did everything: walking, jogging, sprint intervals, elliptical, biking, swimming, etc. I didn't have any set plan, I just did something every day for at least a half hour. I did a ton of sports too since I've always enjoyed pretty much all sports. Don't worry, I lifted weights too. I followed Starting Strength (minus the diet part obviously) for most of the 15 months. Obviously, being on such a massive calorie deficit, I didn't make incredible gains, but I still feel stronger and my lifts went up some. My squat went from 135 to 255 (these are all 3x5 working set numbers btw), deadlift from 135 to 275, I don't remember where I started OHP at but I'm now doing 90 Lbs, I still haven't got the hang of power cleans (and I didn't do them the whole time anyway), and I switched my bench from barbell to dumbell about half way through and currently bench 60 Lb dumbells.\n\nP.S.

However we are mostly just in it to get to be healthy and strong for longevity purposes.\n\nThe trainer at the gym set us up with the gym's beginner routine which is the following:\n\n**Workout 1**:\n\n* Squat 3x5\n* Bench Press 3x5\n* Seated Cable Row 3x5\n* Weighted Pull-up 3x5\n* Barbell Glute Bridge 3x5\n* Romainian Deadlift 3x10\n* Accessories: Face Pulls 4x15, Leg Curl 4x15\n\n**Workout 2**:\n\n* Deadlift 3x5\n* Overhead Press 3x5\n* Weighted Chin-up 3x5\n* Barbell Row 3x5\n* Incline Press with Dumbbells 3x5\n* Barbell Lunge 3x10\n* Accessories: Rear Delt Fly 4x15, Glute Ham Raise 4x10\n\nWe are supposed to workout 2-3 days per week switching off each time between workout 1 and 2. The rest period is supposed to be 2 minutes for the first two exercises on each list, 90 seconds for the others. We increase the weight by one unit (for machines) or 2.5kg total (for barbells) the next session if we complete the lift with the given weight. The accessories they gave us are personal to us, since we are both software engineers. We were told to make sure not to neglect our back, rear shoulders, and hamstrings since we spend a lot of time sitting.\n\nWhen we aren't in the gym there is a plan for the cardio portion of the workout (which is optional but we are doing it) where we start off running 5km 2x per week, and over 3 months it ends up going up to 10km. It's extremely cold and snowy here so they gave us some running ice spikes to attach to our shoes so we don't slip on the ice.\n\nWe were also told to eat at least our bodyweight in protein (in grams). For example I weigh 85kg so I was told to eat at least 85g protein per day.\n\nI have a few questions:\n\n1. The workout routine they gave me is a lot different than the ones I see in the FAQ. Is this a problem? I mean there is no arms workouts or calves workouts at all, but from what I noticed the guys who had been doing the workout for a while actually had quite proportional arms/calves to their bodies and they looked pretty nice.\n\n2. Is the amount of protein enough? Again, it is less than what I have seen posted here but I asked a few guys and the trainer and they said the high protein amounts in fitness magazines and blogs were all complete BS and to just eat a well balanced diet with the amount of protein listed and I should be good.\n\n3. There is no ab workout in the routine but the dudes I see doing this exact routine (although for over a year) actually have visible abs. How is this possible? To be honest I haven't asked anyone about it yet but I was thinking of asking later today when I go to the gym. Maybe they do abs at home, I have no idea.\n\nEdit:\n\nForgot to mention my statistics, if that helps for any of the questions:\n\n* Sex/Gender: Male\n* Age: 25\n* Height: 198cm (6 ft 6 in)\n* Weight 85kg (187 lbs)\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Started training at a fairly well known powerlifting and bodybuilding gym in my country.

Basically 4hrs a week for a year. Injuries and deloads have become rather common and there's no way I was able to train every 3 and a half days. I kept track with a [super simple handmade calendar](http://imgur.com/U3yBphW). The X's on workout days were HUGE for me. I always hang it somewhere where I'll see it often.

I've done yoga for about 7 years now and I did 100 days of meditating for 5 minutes in a headstand. My headstand's pretty solid.\n\n**Where I started from**\n\nI ran the www.100pushups.com program for a while prior starting the bwf program. I thought the ability to do a lot of pushups would equate to being strong. Or that being able to do a lot of pushups would get me a great body. I got really good at pushups. I got really good at doing hard work (endurance work is hard as hell) and I got conditioned to do a program as it said when it said, which was super important because consistency is hard to grab hold to. Back when I knew nothing I made a post of [my routine](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/23dtjt/thoughts_and_comments_on_my_gypsy_bodyweight/). The comments in that thread inspired me to actually sit down and read the FAQ and look at the routine. I decided I wanted to run a REAL routine, that was actually balanced, and had real strength progressions built in. I move often, like, real often, and needed something that I could do anywhere, with minimal equipment. [The routine](http://i.imgur.com/heFEfT3.png) was perfect for me. \n\nI could do 80 consecutive pushups. Something like 60 dips with feet elevated on a chair. 15 really piss poor form HSPU back to wall.\n\nWhen I started the program I had rings hung from an 11ft ceiling in a garage and a pullup bar. Here's the best [pic](http://imgur.com/dMcXOtU) I wish I had taken more pics. Anyways, plastic olympic rings with adjustable straps and a pullup bar. You can see the bar supports coming off from the wall in the back. That was my equipment. My body, rings and a pullup bar.\n\nWhere was my strength my first couple times through the program? Something around this:\n\n2 deadhang pullups. A couple terrible rings dips (maybe some straight bar dips, cant quite remember). Assisted pistols where I wasnt going that deep. Foot supported L-sits because I hated L-sits and they were terrible and I hate them. wide rings pushup. near horizontal row. The program beat the shit out of me. And I freaking loved it. I tried for max effort with explosiveness til form breakdown for everything. I tried to work in a 3x8 setxrep scheme. \n\nI just ran the routine. I tried for 3x a week. I would go 3x8 a progression and then bump to the next progression and usually be at 3x4 and be pissed. I didn't care if I was stuck at 3x6 FOR A WHOLE FREAKING MONTH because my job was to show up, do the work, put in the volume. And I was progressing in other lifts - When you have 6 or 7 lifts you work (handstands, L-sits, vertical pull, vertical push, horizontal pull, horizontal push, legs) stalling out in one lift isnt all that important. You're still progressing and you know you're going to break through eventually. Who cares.\n\n**Where am I at now/Whats my routine?**\n\nI'm still using the recommended routine as a framework. I still often do the dynamic stretches, bodyline work (everything for 60s) about 10-15mins of handstand practice and usually a minute+ or support hold on Pbar (I move often and just haven't put the rings up a bunch lately)\n\n* Vertical Pull: Pullups still. It's either 3x8 archer pullups, 3x8 behind the neck pullups, or 3x8 L-sit pullups, really whatever I feel like working and/or wherever I feel like I'm weak. If I can use weight I try and do weighted pullups with +45lbs (I'm not getting 3x8 tho so i think I need to drop to +35lbs) Most recently I've been working archer as a progression towards One Arm Chin. They're beast.\n\n* Vertical Push: Weighted dips or wall assisted headstand pushups. I've scored two freestanding HeSPU's before and I think I'm about ready to move away from the wall and really start working them freestanding. They're beast.\n\n* L-sit: High tuck V-sit. Sometimes one leg high tuck V Sit. My v-sit progress stalled out for a few months because I would just go into an L and lift as high as I could. A few cues (Push the hips THROUGH!) and and emphasis on tucking the legs and lifting as \"through\"/high as possible as helped me see some progress lately\n\n* Horizontal Push: Adv. tuck planche, 3x8 PPPU AND planche leans. All of them. Adv tuck planche usually gets held for 6-8s, and planche leans get like 10s per set. \n\n* Horizontal pull: Front Lever work. Just recently got my front Lever so it's either front pulls or adv tuck Front lever. I Aim for 2-3 sets above 6s to count as one \"set\"\n\n* Accessory Work/Core Work: I try and target my weakness and work towards where I'm weak. If I make my weak parts strong I won't be weak anymore. If I have time at the end of my workout I do 3x8 dragon flags and I try and work in some ab wheel rollouts or hanging leg lifts. I'll also train grip strength with false grip or some one arm deadhangs or weird grip holds.\n\nI have my vertical push and vertical pull paired. I do pullups and rest 90-120seconds and then i do my vertical push and rest 90-120 seconds. That's one set. I do three sets.\n\nRest a few minutes because that pair always kicks my ass.\n\nThen I do my horizontal push, rest 90-120s, V-sit work, rest 90-120s, then my horizontal pull, rest 90-120. That's one set. I do three sets.\n\nI occassionally do Pistols squats now. I try and run and do yoga. I don't train legs often.\n\n**Diet:**\n\nI'm vegetarian/pescatarian. I drink a lot of beer. I don't track anything. For some reason I can't be bothered. I try to get 100g of protein a day but if I don't I don't do anything about it. I usually eat a lot of pasta and pizza. I try to eat a lot of salad. I haven't had much of an appetite in the past 12 months and for that reason I haven't added much mass. I started at 155ishlbs and I'm somewhere around 170lbs now. I probably gained 12lbs in the past year. A pound a month is terrible.\n\nI take creatine as my only supplement and sometime protein powder. Creatine is seriously the shit. If you're not taking creatine yet you're a complete goon. [read about it](http://examine.com/supplements/Creatine) and buy it. \n\n\nI've lived in 5 homes in the past 12 months. Sacramento, San Diego, Palm Springs, Mammoth Lakes (All California) and ~~I'm currently living in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.~~ Scratch that, back in California, partying for most of June, moving back to Mammoth for a while. I was depressed, awfully depressed, when I started the routine. The value that following a structured program with progressive overload built in has given my life is unreal. Im so, so happy I stuck to this.\n\n**Additional fitness stuff**\n\nI've practiced yoga for 7 or 8 years now and practice as often as I can. Good weeks its two or three times a week. Bad weeks, well, bad weeks turn into bad months and I haven't practiced in the past month. Yoga compliments BWF incredibly well because a fair amount of moves require good flexibility as well (Legs straight in L-sit for example.)\n\nI also live in a ski town during the winter and snowboard as often as I can. This year I nabbed 40 days on this hill and sent [the biggest booter of my life.](http://imgur.com/3ff16ap) It was dope.\n\n**Where do I go from here?**\n\nNot exactly sure. Atleast I haven't laid out a plan yet. I'm dealing with a pretty nagging golfers elbow/tendinitis flare up and need to take some time off to allow that to heal properly. ~~I'm also living in Fort Lauderdale trying to get a job on a luxury yacht, which is something I've never done, and requires a fair bit of attention.~~ I've seen it said that you should switch to a different program when you can't recover quickly enough. My deloads due to tendon pain have been far more frequent than infrequent lately and I do believe I need to find/put together another training plan. The recommended routine was absolutely badass and served me incredibly well but I don't think it's something I can progress linearly anymore.\n\nWord of note, well, word of bragging: Most the mods on /r/bodyweightfitness say they expect my progress to be \"about the max you would see someone achieve\" with a year of doing the program. I've progressed incredibly quick. I work incredibly freaking hard and I've earned it all but I definitely have some favorable genetics and conditions helping.

So the question itself isn't really valid... why would I shiver and sweat and be pissed because I \"want\" more chewing tobacco? I can't want it, because desire requires you to accept that starting again is a possibility. It wasn't and it isn't.\n\nThe same thing with excercise, in terms of how to keep up focus and not stop, regardless of \"motivation\"... I rejected the variable of motivation, and accepted that the question \"should I go to the gym\" is invalid because it contradicts  \"why would I ponder going to the gym when I always go because that's what I do\"\n\nSo this is a mind trick that's probably not even a mind trick, but it is how my head works because I told it to work like that over time.

Thought this might motivate some people to realize your body is a lot tougher than you realize.\n\nIn Dec 2014 I totalled 2100@275 in a powerlifting meet. That placed me top 5 in the country. Two weeks later I ruptured my right quad tendon with 755x5 on squats. I had surgery to reattach it 3 weeks later. I was confined to a leg brace for 8 weeks followed by 2 months of pt and relearning to walk. A month after I was cleared to squat I ruptured the left knee, same injury different leg. Same story on that one, leg brace/rehab. I was finally able to begin squatting again Nov 2015.\n\nI truely thought my competitive days were over. My best squat before was 840 in wraps and 705 beltless. I never expected to hit another all time pr on squat again. I never thought I'd make it back into the top 10 in the country. My doc even told my wife in the recovery room \"prepare him to never squat again\". Thankful she kept that to herself until after last weekend.\n\nSlowly over almost 6 months I got my squat back into the 600's. In that time my wife got pregnant. I wanted to get on the platform one more before the baby came to prove to myself I didn't give up. So I picked a meet and set a goal.\n\nThis wasn't my first rodeo so I knew what I had to do. I picked reasonable numbers for training that would lead me to a successful meet. I was terrified everytime I squatted anything over 600, but I'd push it out of my mind and get under the bar. I ended up with 645x5 and 685x3 as my best squats during prep. Those tied my all time best sleeved squats for reps. I never took a 1rm and decided saving it for the meet would be the safest way to go. \n\nMeet day came and I had a goal of squatting 705, tying my all time best. My second attempt of 685 went so well that I called 720 to give myself cushion for the rest of the day. I absolutely crushed it. Getting squats out if the way took a lot of stress off me. I went on to hit all time bench and deadlift pr's too if 545 and 760. I ended the day totally 2025 with just a belt and some knee sleeves on two busted up knees.\n\nThroughout the last 18 months I also picked up coaching and created a free bench program that many folks have used with great success. I wanted to share that with you guys https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-2wBFzfVZ3idqvI-PKHI0Z9VjUOLqLqGJaXYAb3MIXQ/edit?usp=drive_web. It's fairly advanced but it's what I've used to coach a half dozen other 500 benches.\n\nAnyways guys just wanted to share this. I can't tell you how hard the last two years have been. I hope this helps someone else overcome adversity. It'll get better you just have to work for it.\n\nIf I have time at work I'll do my best to answer anyone's questions on training.\n\nMeet video\nhttps://youtu.be/Yn9DCin89LY\n\nEdit: Added a few videos.\n\n- The squat that started all this - https://youtu.be/r_CSOJX-T1A\n- 5 days post op - https://youtu.be/l2LpZdIKVfY\n- 3.5 weeks post op - https://youtu.be/I3MoJLqPnNc\n- Benching 10 days after surgery - https://youtu.be/t3jzHIKTNHM", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Ruptured both quad tendons, came back with a 2025 raw total, and developed a very successful bench program.

The progressions might seem obvious to some - and there are probably other ways to progress to this, but i just want to share what worked for me. Why even do planks with people on your back? It's a cool skill that takes some serious core and shoulder strength.\n\nSo, if you want to progress there and don't want to watch the video, here's a writeup of the single steps:\n\n* Do planks until you can hold them for 60 seconds.\n* Progress to shoulder taps for 60 seconds. They are like normal planks, but touch your opposite shoulder with one hand, while the other hand stays on the floor.\n* Progress to elevated shoulder taps for 60 seconds. This means, that your feet are elevated a little - which makes the exercise harder.\n* You now have a solid foundation of core strength. I think it's important to build up to 60 seconds of the shoulder taps, before starting with weighted planks, because it prepares your shoulders to stabilize your body when your weight shifts a little.\n* Progress to either one-armed planks or start doing weighted planks from now on. Do this 3 times a week, maybe before or after your workout, and increase the weight by a bit every time.\n* After some weeks/months, you should be able to have people sit on your back, while you perform your planks. Cool!\n\nI hope you enjoy this! I've got some questions aswell, to start a discussion:\n\n* If you can easily take people on your back in a plank, how did you get there?\n* What's your favorite way to train for core strength?", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "How to Progress Planks (until you can take a person on your back)!", "post_ups": 1972, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/54bdfs/how_to_progress_planks_until_you_can_take_a/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:16.860087", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "Antranik", "post_created_utc": 1538932810.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1538952598.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "9m6sdg", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 25, "post_num_crossposts": 2, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1964, "post_selftext": "In the bodyweightfitness [Recommended Routine,](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) the end of the strength work is a [core triplet:](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/core)\n\n* Anti-Extension progression\n* Anti-Rotation progression\n* Extension progression\n\nI took the main pathway from each, so the video consists of...\n\n* Plank or Rollout\n* Banded Pallof Press\n* Reverse Hyperextension\n\n# Video Link: https://youtu.be/QMY9c2wxFDM\n\nThe video is structured in a way that I explain how to do the exercise for less than a minute, and then start doing the actual exercise for 8 reps (do up to 12 if you can), so it mimics the intended structure as much as possible, where the explanation doesn't exceed the prescribed rest of 60secs in between sets and I try to give cues to help you maintain proper form throughout the exercises themselves.\n\nThe neat thing is that the ring rollouts and band pallof presses are easily scalable. And the reverse hyperextensions can be plenty challenging with all the different options possible that I offer. \n\n# Equipment needed\n\n1. Rollouts can be done with rings or ab wheel or office-chair with wheels or clothing/furniture sliders on slippery floor. If you do them on your knees, you may need to use a yoga mat to cushion the knees OR prevent slipping.\n\n2. Pallof Presses can be done with a resistance band or cable machine. They can also be done with rings but they are more awkward to setup. You can also hook the band around a door knob or something lower and do it kneeling, half kneeling or sitting.\n\n3. Reverse Hyperextensions can be done using a bench, couch, ottoman, table, counter or GHR machine.\n\n# Tip\n\n* When starting out, choose the level you are most comfortable with so you build a solid foundation while minimizing risk of injury. \n\n* This is especially true for the roll outs. Doing variations you are not ready for can hurt more than help if you cannot hold proper form. Shoot for at least 12 reps before moving to a harder variation.\n\nWell, I hope that helps!

I was touched by a barbell in Sept. 2011.\n\n---\n#Background\n\nI just want [Frieza delts](http://images.wikia.com/dragonball/images/4/43/Frieza_100%25_Power.jpg). But They don't want me to have joocy delts; They say that OHP progress and shoulder development is impossible without steroids. They say that strength and size is either/or. They say that OHP doesn't matter because it isn't competition lift. But have you ever seen a male bodybuilder worth a damn that couldn't bench 3 plates? Have you seen Dan Green's delts? Have you seen someone with a good OHP with a poverty bench? Exactly. So I press moar. My OHP is the OHP that will pierce the heavens.\n\nI thought to myself that putting 2pl8 over my head for 5x5 would be absurd. Possible, but absurd. But then I finished up a training block hitting 240lb for 4x3, and then the first week had me working with lmao2pl8. So I put on my red cheaty things, took some Cannibal Ferox and went for it. I'm happy I got it, because if I failed I would have dishonoured my family and then need to commit seppuku in the power rack. \n\n---\n#\"Programming\"\n\nBruh, I literally just spam triples until I get what I want. It's 3 week block periodization, based on 5/3/1, which I've bastardization/adjusted to my needs. It is vaguely planed strength work followed by maximalist accessory work. Currently it's the following\n\n* Week One: 8-10x3 @ 80% of training max\n* Week Two: 5-7x3 @ 85%\n* Week Three: 3x3 @ 90%\n\nI spam triple because I really suck at doing anything heavy over 3 reps. This is a stability problem, which is pretty visible in the video...but is much worse than it looks, because I like to train without any supportive equipment, increasingly to my own determent. \n\nAssistance movements that have helped me are: dips, CGBP, rear delt rows, rear delt raises, lateral raises, incline DB press, Z press, military pressing, general speed work, chinups/pullups, and **a lot** of rows.\n\n\"But that's basically... everything\" Exactly. Just lift.\n\nA lot of back work in general. For the longest time (2+ years) I did the following twice a week:\n\n* 5x10 pendlay row\n* 5x10 chinups\n* 5x10 rear delt flys\n\nWhich was actually motivated by not wanting to be a feeble old man.\n\nI'd say actually working on the other 2 heads of your shoulders is the most important thing; that's when everything changed for me.

I know I know, it goes against \u201cbro science\u201d that lifting weights in conjunction with running is counterproductive for gaining muscle mass. Though there may be a little truth in that, I\u2019m trying to find out if there are runners here who have accomplished not only having a pretty nice physique, but also being a proficient runner as well.\n\nI\u2019ve been lifting weights ever since the beginning of high school and really didn\u2019t start running until I joined the Navy. I thought to myself, I didn\u2019t want to be one of those guys that are all show and no go so I began to incorporate runs into my workouts. I was okay for a non competitive runner with a 10k PR timed at 47 minutes. At this point I did start to lose a little weight even though I would lift the same amount of days that I ran a week (2-3 days run, 3 days lift). \n\nThere was a gentleman that I saw on instagram that had some pretty solid times on his marathons, and he also ran them quite frequently. Yeah nothing special, there are plenty of people who run marathons in this sub at the pace he ran them, but what intrigued me was that he definitely could\u2019ve passed for an amateur bodybuilder! Typically, not always but from what I\u2019ve seen, long distance runners are for sure more on the skinny side.\n\nFor those who have balanced a body building type physique, and long distance running, what is your weekly workout routine like, and your daily nutritional intake? \n\nI am not seeking to run marathons at record times, nor look like Phil Heath. Just looking for like minded individuals who\u2019ve done well at balancing both :)\n\nThank you very much in advance to everyone, I appreciate any and all feedback that is given! \n\n\nEdit: I\u2019m honestly overwhelmed at the amount of responses I have received. I want to thank everyone for their time and thought into each and every reply. Y\u2019all have really helped me out by giving personal experience, and even pointing me in the direction of exceptional resources!

But to save you more time I will summarize as much as I can in this post and include gifs as well. In the first part of the video I share....\n\n# The mnemonic to remember the two: \n\n* Imagine that your hips are a bowl full of water. \n* If I tilt the bowl backward, water will spill out the back (posteriorly; posterior pelvic tilt).\n* If I tilt the bowl forward, water will spill out the front (anteriorly; anterior pelvic tilt).\n* GIF: https://gfycat.com/MarriedNiceDragon \n\n## **Posterior Pelvic Tilt** occurs when you tuck your tailbone by squeezing the butt and abs. This is what locks your core. Your core is what stabilizes movement between your lower body and upper body. It's useful for:\n\n* **Intensifying ALL Hip Flexor Stretches**\n* Plank\n* Pushups\n* Handstands\n* Hollow Hold \n* Barbell Hip Thrust\n* Overhead Press\n* Leave a comment saying what else we use this in!\n\n## **Anterior Pelvic Tilting** is when you stick your ass out. It's useful for:\n\n* **Intensifying ALL Hamstring Stretches**\n* Straddle Splits\n* Backbending\n* Bottom of a Squat (but not excessively)\n* Leave a comment saying what else we use APT for!\n\n# Excessive APT vs Normal Lumbar Curve\n\n* In the neutral position, [the hips are naturally tilted slightly forward.](https://i.imgur.com/tRJnCgf.jpg) And the lumbar spine (lower back) normally has a bit of a forward curve the same way your neck does. So a lot of people automatically assume they have \"APT\" but it is not the case as often as people think.\n\n* [There might be dysfunction present if any of the spinal curves are excessive.](https://gfycat.com/WetClearcutAstarte) If someone indeed has excessive APT, the combination of tight hip flexors (and possibly a huge belly can contribute to) to the hips being tilted anteriorly too much and stuck like that. The commonly prescribed go-to solution to that is often to stretch the hip flexors, strengthen the glutes (and engage them more often to reinforce that connection and position). \n\n---\n\nIf you need help in regards to stretching hip flexors and strengthening the glutes, over at /r/flexibility we had motivational months for them with exercises and routines to help:\n\n*  [Basic hip flexor month](https://www.reddit.com/r/flexibility/comments/3fewg8/august_is_hip_flexor_opening_month_look_inside/) \n\n* [active hip flexor month.](https://www.reddit.com/r/flexibility/comments/4hy1aw/active_hip_flexor_flexibility_month_is_starting/)\n\n---\n\n**If you still want to watch the video that explains all this, it's here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj30KLW-S2U**\n\n---\n\nHope that helps!

I had to practice blowing them up in various positions of resistance twice a day. I went from squatting 425 to lying on the floor of my room with a balloon in my mouth. Not as kinky as it sounds. Surprisingly enough, however, *I couldn't do it*. I couldn't put myself in a position of correct pelvic alignment and blow up the balloon. Put plainly, I couldn't breathe as humans are meant to breathe. \n\n**Lifters, sadly, rarely think about how to breathe.** Sure, we know to \"brace\", and we follow cues accordingly; intra-abdominal pressure, we all know, is important. Nonetheless, we ignore the [diaphragm](http://deansomerset.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pfm_with_diaphram.jpg)--especially in relation to the pelvic floor. We don't even think about it as separate from our ab sheath. We focus on moving the weight, and let our bodies compensate for our slack with harmful rotating, collapsing, or lateral shearing forces to maintain torque. These spell injury and weakness.\n\nIf, during lifting, (and, really, your daily life) your pelvic wall and diaphragm aren't parallel and working in concert, **you'll be bleeding force**. This is why strength coaches like Kelly Starret encourage the [sternum/pelvis parallel test](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSuP9MDC2zTPzuAU21xmic_yZZNQ9BaJoLHtiZgcVBoIRxLNi-VCw). Just as you should be exteriorly rotated at the hips and shoulders to create torque, your diaphragm/belly should be \"exteriorly\"/outwardly rotated & expansive. \n\nLong(er) story short, **I blew up balloons daily for ten weeks and felt like a wuss**. I did a bunch of myofascial / band work. I put lacrosse balls in uncomfortable places. Most important, I learned how to control my lungs and breathe better. I learned that there is more to bracing than just squeezing your butt and abs super hard. My test / re-test stunned me. As I stated, I was squatting around 425 for a few reps. Now I'm easily knocking out 450, and in a much safer position.\n\nI can't explain the sensation. I feel as if a whole bunch of pointless, mis-cued tightness in my abdominal cavity has been replaced with a hollow, correctly aligned bottom-up system that allows me to activate my abs/glutes/diaphragm in a way that not only increases my lifts but also saves my body from potentially debilitating injuries/time off. \n\n**It's shocking how bad I was at breathing**\u2013\u2013and how much an inability to breathe correctly will cripple your athletic career/health. I advocate breathing in positions of compromise (5-10 min daily) as well as yoga or any practice that focuses on conscious breathing as the primary vehicle of movement. \n\nSome further reading / watching\n\n* 1 [The Value of Blowing up a Balloon | NIH.GOV](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2971640/)\n\n* 2 [Breathing 101](http://www.jtsstrength.com/articles/2013/05/17/breathing-101/)\n\n* 3 [Basic Kelly Starrett & Breathing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p_9ew0Fe5Q)\n\n* 4 [Watch the video at the end of this post.](http://www.jtsstrength.com/articles/2013/06/26/deadlifts-breathing-and-bracing/) Listen to the guy breathe.

It's destroying your body. Blow up balloons to get better.\n\nEdit: Formatting.

During my junior year I  was able to work closely with the professor for my biomechanics class.  He was a very accomplished, well respected man who had competed in Olympic weightlifting at a professional level.  During this time crossfit had become widely popularized and was sweeping the nation.  He did his  due diligence, did a lot of research and even tried it himself.  He hated it.  For many of the same reasons you will hear in the anti-crossfit circle jerk in this subreddit, but after every one of his rants he would always end it with \"if it'll get them off the couch, f**k it, let em' try it.\"\n\nThis post is not about crossfit, it's about the negativity towards exercise methodologies differing from your own.  For many us fitness is not just a hobby but a lifestyle.  We have spent hundreds, sometimes thousands of hours researching routines, lifts, diets, etc.  For many millions of others fitness is some distant goal they look at but barely have time to make any progress towards.  We as a community need to understand that.\n\nWe weren't born liking fitness.  It wasn't instinctual, it was taught or gained through experience.  I was a very overweight teenager.  I went to the gym dozens of times and left hating it every time.  No one was there to help or motivate me.  One day I picked up a Mens health magazine, cut a two page long routine out and followed it to the letter.  12 years later I still workout 4-5 days a week.  In those 12 years I have done everything from mens health routines, interval training, MMA, Wendler, crossfit, military athlete and a few others.  I tried it all and have learned a great deal.  It all began with a two page mens health cookie cutter routine most here would scoff at.\n\nPeople sometimes come here for advice wanting to know about the success of one program over another and what's better.  We can sit in our arm chairs and type up how crossfit is dangerous and stupid or how over 80% of those who attempt P90X never finish it.  We can take a stance of pointing them towards our preferred method and putting down all others.  Or we can motivate them, encourage them, and allow them to build a love for fitness through the methodologies that appeal to them.  There are too many different forms of exercise to count.  Many of which we don\u2019t agree with.  Although we don\u2019t agree with them or they didn't work for us, everyone is different.  Where we may have failed many thousands of others could have excelled.  I do Olympic lifts and suck at yoga.  Does that mean I should tell someone who asks about yoga that its stupid and hand them a print out of a Wendler routine?\n\nWhen friends and acquaintances ask me for advice on a routine or program they heard of I simply tell them to google some reviews, get the proper equipment, ensure absolute safety (even so far as to get a physical depending on their starting condition) and to get started and stay motivated.  If they ask about it it means they're interested.  If they're interested they just might start it.  If they start it they just might finish.  If they finish they might just continue.  If it'll get them off the couch, f**k it, let em try it.\n\nTL:DR - If people are interested in an exercise routine, even if its not  your preferred way, let them try it.  Make sure they're safe and informed but let them start with what interests them.  They might not take to your method the way you did.  Love of fitness is learned, often times through trial and error.\n\nEdit:  Woke up to front age and gold .... best ... day ... eva.  I also seem to have once again started the crossfit hate circle jerk.  One person already claimed I was beating a dead horse, so not even going to comment on it.  The biggest concern I've read so far is about safety.  I couldn't agree more, which is why I specifically stressed safety in my original post.  If you want to learn to drive a car, ride a bike or rock climb, you don't just go do it.  You need to research, learn, and progress slowly.  Fitness is no different.  My biggest problem when people bitch about the hazards of any routine are because people need to take responsibility for their own safety and do the proper research first.  Doesn't matter if its crossfit, starting strength, insanity, P90X or whatever, you need to understand the basics of movement and the requirements of each.  Do you really think crossfit is all that much more dangerous to a novice than starting strength?  If someone wants to begin SS, but has never done any exercise outside of gym class do you think they're are going to know proper squat and dead lift form.  Or do you think racking up a bar and just going at it will result in injury just as much as CF?  It requires the same amount of dedication to understand the risks in any fitness routine.  This post was not an end all be all about fitness, a simple reminder to those of us who are experienced that we were once novices ourselves and we all gained our love of fitness our own ways.  Let people find their own path instead of shoving yours down their throat.  They might not be receptive.  Our goal should be to motivate and guide them into our culture, not shun them from it.  Getting someone interested in fitness and on the path is whats important.  \n\nEdit 2:  Ok Fine, I give in.  I did crossfit for 5 years.  I stopped participating in the conventional website CF several years ago for many of the same reasons people here believe.  I agree with many of your complaints and they are good points.  But to me telling someone who is interested in crossfit not to do it because they could get hurt is like telling kids to be abstinent forever because they could get an STD.  Educate them, teach them how, stress safety and the fundamentals and they wont get hurt.

My questions are more broad than the title but I'll try to be clear and concise. I'm looking to set myself up with a more effective fitness routine than I currently have, mainly focusing on core exercises and diet. I don't have much technical knowledge and basically have had the same old routine and been the same weight for ages.\n\nCurrent situation: 23, male, 173cm (5'8\"), 60.5kg (133lbs). [Here](https://imgur.com/a/X1psAlh) are two found images that illustrate roughly what I currently look like (in flattering light), and what the goal is.\n\nMy maintenance diet should be approx 2017 calories I think. Currently my diet is quite varied. I tend to just have coffee for breakfast, something like a sandwich, fruit and maybe some nuts for lunch, (or sometimes leftover dinner) and a broad range of things for my evening meal, but typically pretty balanced. I have no real idea if I'm around 2000kcal but I'm guessing so because my weight's quite consistent. I don't hugely want to get into a whole thing of counting calories or (heavily) restricting what I'm eating, as I don't have that much flexibility or even spare mental space to think about it. That being said, I can totally adapt my life to some general guidelines.\n\nWhen my life's under control I probably go to the gym three times a week, maybe four. Each time I spend about an hour. Routine is first, a 10 minute run, then:\n\n* 3x30 press ups (or close to it)\n* 3x10 hanging leg raises\n* 3x10 chin ups (or close to it)\n* 2x15 each side 15kg (33lbs) bentover row\n* 2x10 15kg (33lbs) DB bench press\n* 2x10 25kg (55lbs) barbell squat (with like a raise at the top...)\n* 2x10 12.5kg (27.5lbs) DB curl into Arnold press\n\nThen one training session from the app Six Pack in 30 Days (ha!) which includes a range of ab exercises like crunches of various types, V-ups, planks, and leg raises. I generally don't find these too challenging except when I don't seem to be able to balance properly.\n\nI'm considering adding in/mixing in the 5/3/1 for beginners routine. What I'd like to know is how my current gym routine + diet can be improved to ensure I'm actually improving rather than maintaining, targeting my lower abs better, and not wasting my energy in counterproductive ways. Should I be bulking and then cutting? Lean bulking? Just cutting? Not running? Eating more? Any useful advice and tips are welcome. Genuine questions also. Or a point in the right direction. It's about 10 weeks until summer here and I'd love to have some kind of improvement by then.

The reason I started working out is because I was extremely depressed and refusing to go back on anti-depressants. I went and saw a therapist and she recommended that I join a gym and start working out 3 times a week. \n\nI reluctantly obliged and to be completely honest I absolutely hated it. I hated how uncomfortable I felt there, that I obviously had no idea what I was doing. Most of all I hated the millions of mirrors everywhere, having the person I hated the most staring back at me... \n\nIt took me about 3 months to somewhat enjoy it. It took me about 6 months to start changing my eating habits, when I began I would eat fast food at least twice a day. I slowly started cutting out the fast food and began cooking my own meals. \n\nMy progress has been fairly slow but, to me, the most important thing is that I didn't give up. I'm sure if I completely changed my lifestyle all at once that my results would have been a lot more impressive in a much shorter amount of time but it would not have been sustainable. \n\n**Arms:** http://imgur.com/a/LWUv1\n**Stomach:** http://imgur.com/a/vJDoF\n**Back:** http://imgur.com/a/ChSXW\n\nI wasn't sure of a lot of the names but I did my best to look them up. I don't do every single exercise every day I try to do about 22-25 sets and sometimes it is actually between 10-15 reps not always twelve. I increase the weight each set and do the last set to failure. Here is my current exercise routine: \n\n**Monday: Glutes/Legs**\nSquats - 3x12 - \nHip Thrust - 3x12 \nRomanian Single Leg Squat - 3x12 \nBackward Hack Squat - 3x12\nLeg Press - 3x12 \nLeg Extension - 3x12 \nOne Legged Cable Kickback - 3x12\nLaying Leg Curl - 3x12 \n\n**Tuesday: Shoulders/Chest/Abs**\nShoulder Press - 3x12\nLateral Raise - 3x12\nAlernate Front Raise - 3x12 \nUpright Rows - 3x12\nBench Press - 3x12\nPec Fly - 3x12 \nIncline Bench Press - 3x12 \nHanging Leg Raises - 3x12\nAb Roll Outs - 3x12\nIncline Straight Leg Drops - 3x12\nWeighted Crunches - 3x12 \nIncline Bench Crunches/SitUps(?) - 3x12 \nMedicine Ball Twist - 3x12 \nPlanks - 3x for as long as I can hold it \n\n**Wednesday: Back (FAVOURITE)**\nSeated Back Row - 3x12 \nLying T-Bar Row - 3x12 \nLat Pulldown - 3x12\nAdvanced Lat Pull Down - 3x12\nRear Delt - 3x12 \nDeadlifts - 5x5\nHyperextensions - 3x12 \nChin Ups - 3x12\nDumbell Row - 3x12 \n\n**Thursday: Glutes/Calves/Abs**\nSquats - 3x12 - \nHip Thrust - 3x12 \nRomanian Single Leg Squat - 3x12 \nBackward Hack Squat - 3x12\nCalf Raises - 3x12\nHanging Leg Raises - 3x12\nAb Roll Outs - 3x12\nIncline Straight Leg Drops - 3x12\nWeighted Crunches - 3x12 \nIncline Bench Crunches/SitUps(?) - 3x12 \nMedicine Ball Twist - 3x12 \nPlanks - 3x for as long as I can hold it\n\n**Friday - Arms & Abs** \n3x Super Set - 12 reps dumbell curls, 12 reps hammer curls, 15 reps tricep extensions \n3x Super Set - 12 reps Smith Machine Tricep Push Ups - 7-7-7 bicep curl\n3x Super Set - 12 reps bicep curls on machine - 12 reps tricep pushdown (pulldown?) \nHanging Leg Raises - 3x12\nAb Roll Outs - 3x12\nIncline Straight Leg Drops - 3x12\nWeighted Crunches - 3x12 \nIncline Bench Crunches/SitUps(?) - 3x12 \nMedicine Ball Twist - 3x12 \nPlanks - 3x for as long as I can hold it\n\n**Saturday/Sunday: Rest or maybe some cardio if I feel like it.** \nIf I choose to do cardio it is always stairs, for as long and fast as I can go. Normally if I'm feeling really down I will go and do stairs because it makes me feel a lot better after. \n\nThere are other ab exercises I do but I cannot find what they are called anywhere. I also do yoga every weekday morning before I go to work and take my dogs to the dog park a few times a week. \n\nNow for the diet! As I said this has slowly evolved over the past 20 months. \n\n**Breakfast:** \n3 eggs + 1 cup egg whites - scrambled.  \n\n**Snack**\n1 tub of greek yogurt (500g) mixed with frozen strawberries and a banana and hemp hearts.\nI also cut up fresh strawberries and eat them with it. \n\n**Lunch** \nChicken salad with hemp hearts, pumpkin seeds, almonds, peas, basically whatever I have. \nGreen smoothie with kale, spinach, mangoes, apple juice and orange juice \n\n**Snack**\nNormally I will snack on some almonds or unsalted trail mix with sesame seeds and pumpkin seeds and stuff or other fruit \n\n**Post Work-Out**\nProtein shake - 1 scoop + water \n\n**Dinner**\nVaries but here are some examples:\nTurkey Taco Salad,\nSalmon, rice & veggies, \nChicken Stir Fry, \nSteak, potatoes & veggies \n\nI don't eat like this all of the time, I still have my off days where I eat everything and anything disregarding the consequences and then feel awful after. The key is to not dwell on it and get back on track the next day (still working on not dwelling on it). Don't let one day of unhealthy eating turn into an entire week. \n\nI can honestly say I am sooo thankful I started taking better care of myself. I LOVE going to the gym, I actually look forward to it and have made quite a few good friends there. I can still feel the depression trying to take hold of me but instead of letting it I am fighting it every day. Instead of laying in bed and crying when I feel awful I get moving and feel a lot better. \n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "20 Month Progress - F22 - 145lbs - 127lbs", "post_ups": 1951, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/342rs6/20_month_progress_f22_145lbs_127lbs/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:18.439705", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "shizzler", "post_created_utc": 1546207364.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1546207556.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "ab0cka", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 202, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1947, "post_selftext": "I made a post before Xmas on [/r/Brogress](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brogress) which did well so thought I'd share more details about my progress. First here are the pics (censored this time as the last post attracted lots of comments):\n\n[Pics](https://imgur.com/RuN66pG)\n\nFirst pic was in 2014. I hated sports and avoided exercise as much as possible my whole life, and after 23 years I was obviously a little chubby. I decided I had to make a change, so started running. I was awful at it, and was barely able to do a km at an awful pace. However, I stuck to it and before I knew it I was running almost every day. The shin splints eventually went away as my body got used to running and my heart rate was dropping.\n\nEventually I bought a Garmin watch which encouraged me to run even more. I would get up before work every day and run a lap of my local park (6km), and on weekends I started doing long runs (10-20km).\n\nIn February 2016 I decided to run my first race (10km) which I completed in 45:45 (4:35 min/km pace).\n\nAfter a while I decided to commute to work by running (5km each way, so 50km a week), and did this for 6 months (in any weather, be it cold and snowy or 30c and humid).\n\nIn parallel to this I decided to start eating healthier, targeting 1900 kcal on MFP. I went from 70kg to 55kg.\n\n[Pic](https://imgur.com/IoabanH)\n\nUnfortunately running took its toll and in late 2016 I developed a stress fracture (I think) above my right ankle which completely prevented be from running. Frustrated, I decided to focus weightlifting as I was now pretty skinny anyway.\n\n# Weightlifting\n\nI started lifting in June 2016 and did a bastardised 4 day split of PPL where instead of splitting out Legs as a separate day I incorporated it with the Push and Pull days. After a while I progressed to a traditional 6 day PPL which I'm still running. The exercises have changed a bit over time but by and large have remained the same. My current routine has the same exercises for both PPLs in each week, with the first half of the week focusing on strength (high weight low reps) and the second half on hypertrophy (higher reps less weight).\n\nHere it is in more detail:\n\n**Push**\n\n5x5 Bench or OHP\n\n3x8 Incline DB Bench\n\n3x10 Cable Chest Flyes\n\n3x10 Cable Lateral Raises\n\n3x8 Skullcrushers\n\n3x8 Tricep Pushdown\n\n**Pull**\n\n2x5 Deadlift\n\n3x8 Bent-over Rows\n\n3x8 Weighted Neutral Grip Pull ups\n\n3x15 Facepulls\n\n3x8 Seated Machine Rows\n\n3x8 Concentration Curls\n\n3x8 Hammer Curls\n\n**Legs**\n\n5x5/4x8 Squats\n\n3x8 Romanian Deadlifts\n\n3x10 Leg Press\n\n3x1min Weighted Planks\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy current numbers are:\n\nBench 80kg (5 reps)\n\nSquat 140kg (5 reps)\n\nDeadlift 170kg (2 reps)\n\nBent over Row 80kg (6 reps)\n\nWeight pull ups +25kg (6 reps)\n\nWeighted planks +25kg\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like my chest is lagging behind but it's finally going up slowly after plateauing for ages around 70kg. I experienced quite a few plateaus, mainly due to cutting for a while and injuries (usually elbow tendinitis). I have been bulking most of the time though, as I aim for 2500-3000 kcal a day and 150g of protein. I don't track anymore so my estimated intake could be way off, although i know I'm hitting my protein targets as I usually have a shake after working out (45g), a protein cookie a few hours later (38g) then usually some meat for lunch and dinner which should be enough to get to 150g.\n\nThe only other supplement I take is creatine.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "M/5'6/27 (70kg -> 70kg = 0kg) (4 years): 2 years of running followed by 2.5 years of weightlifting.", "post_ups": 1947, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ab0cka/m5627_70kg_70kg_0kg_4_years_2_years_of_running/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:18.439705", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Snycs", "post_created_utc": 1415727634.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2lzfkt", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 463, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1944, "post_selftext": "And the new Broscience video is out, What is a Pump? \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPVBYI4N3Js&list=UUduKuJToxWPizJ7I2E6n1kA", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Broscience: What is a pump?", "post_ups": 1944, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2lzfkt/broscience_what_is_a_pump/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:18.439705", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "zoidbergular", "post_created_utc": 1518039989.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1518058865.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "7vzq11", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 224, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1941, "post_selftext": "[Link to Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLow1p1QZAE)\n\n[Andy Baker](https://startingstrength.com/author/andy-baker) is a Starting Strength Coach and co-author of Mark Rippetoe's [Practical Programming for Strength Training.](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Programming-Strength-Training-Rippetoe/dp/0982522754) In this video, Andy demonstrates and explains four common technique mistakes that can lead to injury while deadlifting, and how to fix them:\n\n1.

Has made me more humble and realize that an injury is not the end of the world, life goes on! To everyone messaging me thanking for giving them hope after their injury, I am glad it boosted you up! That was the only reason I shared my face on reddit lol hoping that it might raise someone up who's dealing with injuries! Message me how your recovery goes or if you just need someone to talk to!\n\n**Details:**\n\n**I am 25 year old.**\n\n**Steroids??** Lot of people have been suspecting steroid use. Bruhhh, I don't even take caffeine or any pre-workouts. Why the fuck would I use steroids? I started getting accused of juicing when I had hardly gained like 30lb and looked \"less skinny\". Everybody's different, people react to training and diets differently, genetics are different. I am nobody to accuse someone of something when I don't even know what they have gone through and how much hard work they have put to achieve what they have achieved. This weight is nothing compared to what I could have achieved if I did hop on the juice train. I had hit 275lb bench (I started from a skinny less than 135 bodyweight who couldn't do a single push up) within 2 years of benching and eating like a maniac. No steroids. I went from less than 135 to 225 body weight in 2 years just eating like a pig. I have also been consistent to the gym - 5-6 times a week for past almost 3 years now. 295 lb is actually not much as I am a pretty heavy guy but I am cutting myself a bit of slack because of the injury. Powerlifters in my gym bench over 405 quite often which is inspiring too. Maybe one day I will get there too.\n\n**The injury:** Bottom portion of the bone was completely detached. And the muscles around it (I am a big guy) make it move an inch. When I broke it, somebody had to literally grab my arm from the back and hand it to me as it would just turn around as it was completely detached. I had to hold my arm with the left one else it would float back. Was fucked up. \n\nWorking out gets you pretty used to pain. I had no expressions of pain or laugh. It was just something. I felt something in the tricep (bone was trying to push out) but I have been pretty good with handling pain. My friends who were there said they couldn't tell I was injured because I had no signs of pain on my face lol\n\n**Surgery:** To fix it, they did a surgery and put a metal plate and 6 screws in. They had to cut the bicep and front deltoid muscles for it (I saw pictures, not a good thing to watch). There were a few reasons why we chose surgery instead of conventional cast - 1. I had the cast for 1 week but my bone didn't align at all because of my bigger arms moving it by an inch. Cast wasn't going much because my bigger arm muscles were putting extra padding force on the bone 2. I didn't want to wait for 6 months of cast (I do coding and need to be able to type). 3. Even after 6 months of cast, I wasn't guaranteed to get it fixed as if the bones fused incorrectly, then they would have to break it and wait for it to fuse again. 4. I was also part of a volunteer research patient for the hospital, so my surgery and recovery was used as a part of that. 5. With the cast, I couldn't even sleep on the bed. I had to sleep on a chair for 1 week which hurt like a bitch. Plus the cast fucked my back up a bit because it was very heavy and also pulled on my neck.\n\n**Reason for breaking:** even I can't tell on why I broke it. I have always worked out with many strong competing powerlifters and my form has always been good. Also the 275 I used to do it for 6-7 reps with good form so it wasn't any heavy weight. Only thing which might have been the case is I might have over-tucked my elbows in causing too much torsion on the bone. Surgeon said bones can take a lot of force downwards and even a bit of elasticity in rotation but too much torsion or 90 degree force will cause it to snap. Arm wrestling or falling on your wrist / falling off of a horse or sideways hit or while throwing something are most common way to break a humerus or forearm bone. My surgeon said it was his first time seeing someone break a humerus from bench press. Usually it's a shoulder dislocation OR the forearm is supposed to break first as it's a thinner bone. Also I don't have any preexisting condition and the X-rays didn't point out any bone conditions.\n\n**Recovery:** No lifting for about 4 months. Got depressed, but only way I was able to cope with it was to stay within friends. The next day after my surgery I went back to the gym and did body weight squats. I just needed to stay within people to not get depressed. I consistently squatted 3 times a week during my recovery and now my squat is almost at 5 plates. I couldn't originally do the \"regular arm bent at the elbow\" squat as my arm would hurt under too much weight. So I was doing squats with my arms extended out (Titanic pose). Only last couple months, I have been able to get my arm to bend without too much pain on a heavy squat weight.\n\nAlso an important thing - if you are wearing a sling / heavy cast / picking up groceries or anything with your non-broken arm, keep you lower back and posture in check. Your body might start overcompensating from one side and might cause lower back issues/ muscular imbalances.\n\nAfter the injury, I started lifting upper body again in March this year. I believe in **slow and steady wins the race**. Started with 5lb dumbells, then slowly added 5 lb every couple weeks then slowly started to transition to the barbell. Started at empty bar then worked my way up very very slowly.\nSo 8 months to get back to where I used to be and a bit stronger. I still can't do pull ups, chin ups, dips etc. Anything which puts 90degree force doesn't go well for my arm.\n\nMy dumbbell work had helped me tremendously in getting the arm strength equal. Currently I am at 95lb for 3 sets of 10-12 on a good day. \n\nBones are VERY good at healing, especially if you are young. My doctor said about up to age 30-40 but it really all depends upon your lifestyle, diet, activeness, genetics etc. Especially in my case, because I had already been working out, my body was already very good at recovering.  It's not the bone which makes you lose strength. In fact bones do get stronger often after fusing together as there is a thick calcium deposit around the break. It's the bicep and front deltoid muscles they had to cut open for the surgery which makes you weaker. That's why the stabilizing dumbbell work helped tremendously to bring both arms to same strength levels.\n\n**About the suicide grip:** I agree with you, I hate myself for that too. However the proper thumb around makes my right forearm extremely tight after the lift (it's the broken arm). I have tried physio and talked to my doctor too but they couldn't help. This is the only reason why I have stopped doing bench press as a regular lift. I just do Dumbbells (proper grip no problems) regularly and occasionally try bar bench to see how it goes.\n\n\n**Warmups:** Yes! A LOT! Warm up is the best way to get confident on your heavier lifts. For example my squat attempted max right now is 460x3. So I firstly foam roll the entire body and do some body weight squats just to get a feel. Then empty bar for 3-4 sets. 1 plate for 3 sets of 10 reps. 2 plates for 2 sets of 5 reps. 3 plates for 1 set of 5 reps, 365 for 3 reps. Now I put on my belt. 4 plates for 6 reps. Then 465 for as many reps possible. Basically by the time you get to the heaviest weight, you will already be confident enough and joints and everything would be warm enough for the lift.\n\nFor bar bench I do extra work: Foam roll the entire body. Warm up the shoulders, especially the rotator cuff with 5 lb dumbells. (look up the warmup exercises on google). Empty bar for 4 sets. 1 plate for 2 sets of 10 reps. 185lb for 5 reps. 2plates for 5 reps. 255lb for 3 reps. Then go for the PR.\n\nNow I do dumbell bench as my primary chest movement and occasionally (maybe once a month) I do bar bench. For dumbells, the same shoulder rotator cuff warmups. Then start with 10lb dumbells and keep adding 10-15lb until I get to the 95 lb dumbells. That's my current max for 10-12 reps. I do that for 3-4 sets. I know I am warming up too much. On my squats I can probably get away with lesser warm ups but on the upper body movements, I really need it after my injury. I honestly feel better by doing lots of warm ups then going for heavy weight than with lesser.\n\n**To those who are afraid of injury,** my only advice is to keep your form in check. If Injuries happen, go through recovery, you get over them and continue moving forward. Do the physio therapy sessions and exercises as a religion. Don't skip it! When the injury happens it's the most depressing feeling ever (especially if lifting is the only thing you enjoy doing in life). However after recovery you look back and really appreciate it as a humbling experience. Also you realize how amazing the body is at healing itself. Never be afraid to get under the bar and get shit done. If you injure one body part, you can still workout other body parts. I consistently squatted 3 times a week during my recovery and now my squat is almost at 5 plates. \n\nAnother advice is to have a second hobby which makes you happy. I picked up violin lessons right after my injury as I really needed something to look forward to. I started violin lessons a month after the injury. The main reason I picked up the violin was to find a new hobby to look forward to. When the only thing you love doing (working out in my case) gets taken away from you, you get depressed. You need 2 things to keep yourself happy and looking forward to something, that's why I chose violin. Plus I wanted to learn a musical instrument for the longest time. It was a new challenge. Violin or anything which requires precision use of the arm muscles actually helps with the recovery too so that was a bonus. In the beginning, it was painful as I needed to raise my right arm to hold the bow but slowly it got better. I am glad I did. Have been playing for about 11 months now. It's a very slow instrument but I am slowly getting better! I want to be that big strong guy with the beard and plays violin lol. Maybe a violin progress video will be next haha\n\n**If you are going through an injury, please feel free to message me if you need someone to talk to. Don't ask medical advice though. I know it gets depressing as I have been there. Only way around it is to stay within friends, talk to people.

I was feeling great in the gym, happy with my lifts and overall progress. For no reason other than to experience my first cut, I decided to do just that and see what it was like. I wound up at 155 lbs before I couldn't stand the feeling of not getting enough carbs for an awesome workout and after watching my strength, the thing I worked so hard on over my first year, deteriorate.\n\n[Start @ 144 lbs](https://i.imgur.com/Sj7a39U.jpg)\n\n[End of 1st bulk @ 180 lbs](https://i.imgur.com/bgsR3yI.jpg) -  *I get it, I didn't shave, and I'm a hairy mofo*\n\n[Now @ 155 lbs](https://i.imgur.com/utQj7wx.jpg)\n\n[Back @ 155 lbs](https://i.imgur.com/41dPW7n.jpg)\n\n\nI really don't know what my body fat % was at the height of my bulk vs. today so I'm sorry I don't have that info. I'm not experienced enough to throw out numbers of what I think a 20% BF vs. 10% BF looks like.\n\n\n**GOALS**\nThe main reason why I decided to cut was really just to experience the process. I've seen a few guys at the gym go through their cuts to compete and the process seemed fascinating in addition to them getting shredded like a julienne salad. I have/had zero desire to compete, but hey, I put on some muscle, and dammit now I wanted to see what that looked like without the added layer of body fat hanging around. I set a goal to get to 155 lbs with no real reason other than I figured for someone who's my height and hit the gym 4+ times a week - it should show for a pretty nice and realistic physique. The wife and I have a trip to Hawaii scheduled in March so my \"due-date\" allowed me to take things nice and slow.\n\n\n\n**DIET**\nMy starting calories at the height of my bulk were around 3,100 (P: 241, C: 376, F: 80) My plan was to slowly cut 200-ish calories every few weeks since I wasn't in a big hurry to lose the weight and I wanted to keep as much strength as possible and continue to take advantage from noobie-gainz that may have still been lingering. Technically speaking, the first month and a half I was still eating in a surplus so my workouts felt great and I felt like I kept my strength up, if not actually progressed a little.\n\nMy current macros today are | P: 165, C: 170, F: 65 so, just over 1,900 calories.\n\nStarting the cut, I can't tell you how excited I was to not have to eat 5 times a day or feel like I was force-feeding myself. As time went on, I basically ate most of the same foods that I ate during my bulk, just less of them. I cut out the 'easy' calories like smoothies and whatnot and also got serious in watching my sugar intake. Each day was laid out in a similar way of:\n\n\n**Breakfast**\n\n* 3 eggs\n\n* 2 egg whites\n\n* 2 servings of frosted mini wheats with almond milk\n\n\n**Lunch**\n\n* 1/4 cup brown rice\n\n* 5 oz. chicken\n\n\n**Pre-workout**\n\nI started to notice I had a better experience at the gym if I had carbs in me 30 minutes or so before-hand. This is one of the reasons I kept my carbs light for lunch (because I didn't *need* them for my desk-job) so I would typically eat some cereal or Optimum Nutrition has some Protein Cake Bites that are DAMN GOOD and did the trick. It made for a nice jolt of sugars and carbs to use for the workout.\n\n\n**Post-workout**\n\nI continued to be religious with a double-scoop whey protein shake with 5g of creatine.\n\n\n**Dinner**\n\nHere is where I would simply eat to fill the rest of my macros. Potatoes or rice, chicken, cod and shrimp cooked with oil would usually did the trick. \n\n\nAll-in-all, my diet was pretty boring. Sometimes I'd cook mixed veggies in for a lunch or dinner but it really didn't get any crazier than this. It just sucked keeping this up for the 6 months I cut for.\n\n\n\n**STRUGGLING**\nPerhaps setting a goal of getting down to a certain weight with not particular reason, other than to see if I could made things tough because I also figured I could keep my workouts intense and my strength progressing linearly. It seemed when I weighed anything under 165 lbs, I got a front row seat to watch my strength and stamina dwindle. The small carb intake made lifting heavy with the same intensity as I had during a bulk extremely difficult. The struggle with not being strong, or getting stronger AND getting shredded was tough to experience but I didn't want to give up either. There was a point when I had to swallow the ego, and just let the process do it's thing. That said, this process really tests you mentally and pushes your limits so I suppose I can be grateful for that learning experience and apply it later.\n\n\nFood was another thing that was tough to keep super under control. I would estimate 80% of the time was spent clean eating but I never let a family party or dinner with friends get in the way of me eating... like, a lot. I'm talking, I didn't stop at just pizza, but I said \"yes please\" to cake and ice cream as well. I take for granted my natural tendency to be lean and would see that two days of light cardio would get me right back on track. I understand for some, this isn't fair, but it allowed me to bend my diet. THIS, isn't a good thing though because I imagine I took advantage of it a few too many times.\n\n\nOne last interesting thing I noticed was there was almost a full month where my body just stuck around 165 lbs, regardless of the change in calories. During that month I dropped my daily calories by 400 but my weight seemed to only fluctuate a pound or two but it was always up or down. It wasn't until dropping the calories by 500 did my weight finally start dropping as well. I don't really know what this was all about or if I was just tracking macros wrong during this time but found it an interesting struggle nonetheless.\n\n\nBEING SORE more times than not sucked hard. Getting down lower and lower in my carbs I would feel that I wasn't recovering the same. I'm no nutritional expert but is there a correlation here? I never got sore so often during the bulk. Is this due to the volume work during the cut vs. more strength work during my bulk or is this nutritional? In any case, leg days would put my hamstrings being sore for 3-4 days and deadlifting constantly left my butt and lower back aching as well. \n\n\n\n**PROGRAMMING**\n\nDuring this cut, I ran two programs. The first program I ran was the [Free Powerbuilding Program from Brian Alsruhe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99ksGGmVaAM). \nThis was a 4-day a week program that went 12 weeks. He designed each day to incorporate 'giant sets' which typically put an antagonistic movement, then a main movement, then a core movement together all without resting in between movements. For example, when bench pressing you might do 8 bent-over rows (*antagonistic movement*), then 8 bench presses (*main*) and finally 8 knees-to-elbow pull-ups (*core*). The three together, were one set and you'd have 4 or so sets. \n\nThis made for shorter gym-days and frankly felt like you were working cardio in the mix. This program was designed to do on a caloric surplus but what I can say is that my strength stayed relatively high on week 12 when I re-tested my 1RM (*I'll list those numbers below*)\n\n\nThe second program was a Kizen \"[Strength Training & Fat Loss](https://kizentraining.com/p/strength-and-fatloss-program-12-week)\" program designed to incorporate lots of volume which I imagine would help to preserve muscle mass while on a caloric deficit. Their system was designed to keep macros structured where you kept your protein and fats relatively high, and cut your carbs. I'm not going to lie, but I hated this program lol - Not because I think it didn't work, but because of all the damn volume. During my bulk, I loved training like a powerlifter where it's a 5/3/1 type layout or where you would continue doing a single rep of heavy weight... Pulling a single 425lb deadlift felt easier than five sets of ten at 270 lbs! In a caloric deficit, this felt like straight death. I also started to notice my workouts taking upwards of two hours just from resting and feeling like shit. I was grateful when I ate pizza over the weekend from a birthday party since the carb surplus would make me feel like superman at the gym for a day.\n\n\nBoth of these programs were neat, but ruined because of the cut. Sorry if I sound like a whiny bitch but again, the amazement in what a caloric deficit does to training just....sucks lol\n\n\n\n**MY LIFTS**\nI can't complain much about where my lifts wound up since they mark the new foundation and starting point to bulk back up.\nTop of the bulk | **Bench:** 225 x 1, **Squat:** 315 x 2, **Deadlift:** 415 x 1\n\n\nThere was only one time I tested my 1RM during the cut and I weighed ~ 165 lbs. During this time, here were my maxes | **Bench:** 205 x 1, **Squat:** 315 x 1, **Deadlift:** 425\n\nI was damn happy but I did have another 10 lbs to lose. TODAY I honestly don't know what my 1RM might be since I've been working on a lot of volume work. Plus, my current diet makes sure any weight I lift feels 10x heavier than it actually is so I haven't attempted any 1RM.\n\n\n\n**WHATS NEXT?**\nUh, bulking, here I freggin come!!! I haven't solidified any numbers I'd like to hit during the bulk but I figure when I get to the point where I think I'm fat, I'll drop to maintenance and re-comp there but probably not legit cut for a while. I might hop on the [ol PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) routine from /u/Metallicadpa and see how far I can get with a linear progression-type format and for the fact that I REALLY loved this program. I also have a [16 week \"Powerbuilding\" program from Kizen](https://kizentraining.com/p/powerbuilding-16-week) that I'd like to try out. I simply can't wait to get back into a caloric surplus haha!\n\n\n\n**SOMETHING TO TAKE-AWAY**\nFor any of my skinny dudes out there lifting for the first time, keep bulking as clean as possible, for as long as possible. If you start to feel fat, keep your calories/macros right where they're at for a few months and just keep hammering away at the gym. I've had a few knowledgeable gym buddies ask me \"why are you cutting?\" and even had a few say to me \"I think you looked better at 180 lbs\" and you know what?.?.? I would agree! This was a cool experience which continues to fascinate the hell out of me BUT, the exhilaration of them calories working their asses off to provide an intense workout is just AWESOME so keep that going! Being lean naturally doesn't really require much need for cutting.\n\n\nDiet is freggin everything!!! Who would have thought, right? It's exactly what people say. Weight itself is a product of calories-in vs. calories-out; believe in it and you'll see results. It's the proper balancing act of your macros that will determine the extent of those results.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Transformation Update: 144 lbs -> 180 lbs -> 155 lbs | My first cut", "post_ups": 1928, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7wtk0o/transformation_update_144_lbs_180_lbs_155_lbs_my/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:18.439705", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "CG06", "post_created_utc": 1443317835.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1443393309.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "3mj64c", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 269, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1927, "post_selftext": "Transformation pics:\nhttp://imgur.com/4dZcALk\nhttp://imgur.com/ALBpw4c\n\n2 years ago i was fat lazy and pretty much didn't do crap besides play games and eat all day.

Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that macronutrient ratios don\u2019t matter, because they do.

In high school, I was every gym teacher\u2019s nightmare- constantly \u201cforgetting\u201d my gym clothes and only participating when forced to.  I also suffered from a debilitating illness that often left me bedridden. In two years, I saw over 40 different doctors.  At one point, I was wearing double knee braces and popping tons of pain pills just to be able to walk.  Eventually, I diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, with Sjogren\u2019s disease as a likely secondary.  In college, I slowly started to get better.  I pulled myself off almost all of my meds because of side effects, and the worst symptoms faded as I got older, although I still had issues with the arthritis in my knees and chronic nausea.  \n\nIn my sophomore year of college, they opened up a brand new rec center.  My then-boyfriend forced me to go with him.  He quickly quit working out to play video games, and while I kept going, I fell into the typical cardio-bunny cycle: binge eating followed by guilt-driven exercise.  I mainly did the elliptical and weight machines, but never really made any progress.   \n\nIn May of last year, I planned a vacation and wanted to get \u201ctoned\u201d for the beach.  I found r/xxfitness, made a post complaining about jiggly thighs, and was promptly ordered to squat.  I started browsing r/fitness religiously and read Starting Strength.  I went into the weightroom for the first time terrified.  I got to the squat rack and almost left.  But I stayed, and it turned out \u2013 I really fucking loved weightlifting.  I started going 6 days a week. Within a month, the pain and swelling in my knees had disappeared.  I started tracking my foods, eating more, and my chronic nausea got better.\n\nIn September, I started in on Stronglifts, and made some really awesome progress.  I began to stall, and was informed that it was due to my eating habits.  I had been a vegetarian for 7 years, but powerlifting converted me.  I switched to Texas Method in March and started bulking with ALL the meats (and by all, I mean bacon). \n\nNow I\u2019m working with a trainer learning Olympic lifting, and eventually I would like to compete.  Fitness has gone from being something I hated, to my major hobby. I lift 3x a week, play on my company\u2019s softball team, and go to a weekly bootcamp class. I even ran my first race 2 weeks ago.  Fitocracy has been a huge motivating factor along the way, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is getting into lifting.  My numbers aren\u2019t as strong as I would like them to be, but it\u2019s been a hell of a year with school on top of working full time.  And overall, I am very happy with my progress.\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "This is what a 10lb muscle gain looks like on a woman", "post_ups": 1924, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/x4r4g/this_is_what_a_10lb_muscle_gain_looks_like_on_a/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:18.439705", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "diamond_sourpatchkid", "post_created_utc": 1438066277.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1438114862.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "3evcwb", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 484, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1916, "post_selftext": "Its because we have no *idea* what is comfortable for our bodies.

I'm and 18y/o guy with no previous experience lifting so this was all new to me. I did arrive with a plan in mind, 10 mins of cardio, and then do a circuit of the weight room, bench, dumbbells etc.. for about 45 mins and then finish with another 10 mins of cardio. The first 10 mins on the treadmill went by comfortably (I jog so it was a cinch). The weight room was a bit uncomfortable for flabby stick-armed me being around jacked football players, but I learned what I can lift and got to know the room well so I was happy enough with that. But then I got back on the treadmill for my last 10 mins of cardio. While I jog I listen to music so I put my iphone in the cupholder on this treadmill and plugged in my earbuds. 8 mins into my run I leaned back a bit too much and pulled my iphone out of the cup which promptly bounced off the treadmill and landed on the sideboard on my left. For some reason I though it would be a good idea to try to pick it up WHILE I WAS RUNNING. Im sure you get an idea of what happened next. I bent down, my legs couldn't extend to fully complete a stride and I fell on my side on the treadmill. The belt flipped me fully around and shot me off into the wall behind me. It didn't hurt much, but I was completely shamed. I've used treadmills before, like a lot, but there I was looking like fool sitting on my ass. A girl next to me asked if I was okay and I could only respond with an embarrassed \"yeah\". After that, since I was nearly done I just left. I can say with a decent amount of confidence that this is the most utterly humiliating thing I have ever done in my life.

It has been low carbs, low fat, high protein. No specific macro percentage. I recorded calories initially, but then stopped recording calories when I figured what meals I have to eat, and then just kept on repeating the same meals. I would switch my meals and do a calorie count recalculation then would just keep repeating the same meals. I am quite disciplined on what I eat 5 days a week. Out of the remaining 2 days, I would fast for one and eat whatever and how much ever I want in the other. I also made a policy of always no matter what eating only what I cook. I don't mean home-made, I mean self-made and home-made. I wouldn't even eat food made by other people at their homes. The reason for it being, cooking burns some calories, laziness to cook keeps the volume down. Then there is always the healthy factor, I can make a carrot cake myself which would be healthier than most sandwiches. \n\n**Training**\n\nI kept switching workouts throughout. I initially started with a gym trainer giving me some machines based workouts. I forget what they were, I didn't really stick to them, and soon switched to group classes in the gym, like Pilates, Air Core, etc. I wasn't really regular in any one of them. \n\nI later switched to CrossFit and SL 5x5 and cycling 30kms a day simultaneously. I did Crossfit religiously for 6 months, but an elbow injury while trying to do a muscle up, put me out of action for 2 months. \n\n**1RMs**\n\n* Back Squat: 215Lbs\n* Front Squat: 205Lbs\n* Deadlifts: 315Lbs\n* Push Press: 125Lbs\n* Hang Squat Cleans: 165Lbs\n* Squat Cleans: 175Lbs\n* Power Cleans: 115Lbs\n\nI got back in action last week and started with MMA and Boxing. I am continuing with SL 5x5. I got really bored of Crossfit. Also at any given time, I have some movement goals, which I am constantly working towards. Few of my current movement goals are\n\n* Freestanding Handstand\n* Backflip and Frontflip\n* Kip Up/Kick Up\n\n\n**Issues**\n\nThere are a couple of things though which I needed your advice on fam.\n\n* I may have lost all that weight, and have become fitter than I ever have been in my life. But in my head I have all the same insecurities, low confidence of a fat guy. There are often situations where I am still the fat guy in my head. I have not been able to beat the fat guy in my head. If anyone has any advice for that I would love to hear it.\n\n* Loose skin and stretch around my belly. They look really ugly. Should I get them checked or they will go away with time?\n\n\n**TL;DR Was fat before. Am thin now, but still have all the fat guy disadvantages in my head.**\n\n\n\nEdit: this blew up. Thanks a lot to everyone for your encouraging, thoughtful and inspiring responses. I am trying to reply to every comment. But there are quite a lot of them.

I wanted to start lifting but my parents were worried about it stunting growth or causing injuries, etc. I did some research to convince them it was alright. Honestly it was more the fact that I actually did research, rather than the actual content that convinced them.\n\n**Weight training and young people**\n\n**Growth plates**\n\nBones grow from the ends outwards. At the ends of longer bones there are areas from which new bone tissue is produced. The area is made up of cartilage. When the child has finished growing, the area hardens and the growth plate fuses with the rest of the bone, forming a complete bone. Some sources show growth plates close at around ages 14 to 16 ([Duke Medicine](http://www.dukemedicine.org/blog/your-growing-bones-all-about-growth-plates)), while others indicate 15 to 17 ([KidsHealth](http://kidshealth.org/parent/medical/bones/growth_plate_injuries.html)). Some claim that weight training damages these plates and consequently hinders growth or causes premature hardening of the plate.\n\nGrowth plates are softer than the surrounding tendons and ligaments, so are more susceptible to fractures. 30% of fractures in children occur around the growth plates ([Duke Medicine](http://www.dukemedicine.org/blog/your-growing-bones-all-about-growth-plates)). In one large study of growth plate injuries in children, the majority resulted from a fall, usually while running or playing on furniture or playground equipment. Competitive sports, such as football, basketball, softball, track and field, and gymnastics, accounted for one-third of all injuries. Recreational activities, such as biking, sledding, skiing, and skateboarding, accounted for one-fifth of all growth plate fractures, while car, motorcycle, and all-terrain-vehicle accidents accounted for other of fractures involving the growth plate. ([MedicineNet](http://www.medicinenet.com/growth_plate_fractures_and_injuries/article.htm)). Growth plate injuries most commonly occur after an acute event, ie a trauma or accident ([MedicineNet](http://www.medicinenet.com/growth_plate_fractures_and_injuries/article.htm)). This is usually due to collisions or falling; the plates are damaged in the same way other bone is.\n\nTraining with weights is unlikely to cause injury to these plates. Lifting weights puts pressure on the joint and so subsequently could cause injury. However, damage to growth plates is unlikely, as most fractures and breaks in this part of the bone are caused by a single gross trauma, like a fall or a blow; ie not the consistent, but comparatively small force provided by lifting weights. For comparison, jumping from a height of 80 cm is said to impart a force 20 times that of body weight on the ankles (Schmidtbleicher, D. An interview on strength training \u2013 reported in [Hamill (1994)](http://www.velocitysp.com/multimedia/docs/lehi/Hamill,_Relative_Safety-3.pdf)), while no such force occurs in weight training.\n\n[Hamill (1994)](http://www.velocitysp.com/multimedia/docs/lehi/Hamill,_Relative_Safety-3.pdf) shows training with weights to have a 0.0035 per 100 participation hours injury rate, while schoolchild soccer is reported to be 1700 times more dangerous (6.20/100 hours). Badminton, athletics, volleyball and cross-country are all shown to be multiple orders of magnitude more likely to cause injury than lifting weights.\n\n**Other concerns**\n\nIt has also been noted that weight training does not interfere with growth by other means (Ramsey, 1990; Sailors, 1987; Seigel, 1989; Weltman, 1986). Research reviewed by Theintz (1994) seems to suggest that sport training for less than 15 hours per week was not disruptive to hormonal status, growth or puberty (Reported [here](http://www.exrx.net/WeightTraining/Weightlifting/YouthMisconceptions.html))\n\n**Anecdotal evidence**\n\nDave Draper, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Lou Ferrigno, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, David Robinson, Karl Malone, Michael Vick all started lifting weights in their early teens and are over 6\u2032 /1m82 tall ([StrongLifts](http://stronglifts.com/does-weight-lifting-stunt-growth/)).\n\n**Less injury prone**\n\n[Cahill (1978)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/686227) (mentioned [here](http://www.exrx.net/WeightTraining/Weightlifting/YouthMisconceptions.html)) noted that the number and severity of knee injuries was reduced in athletes who trained with weights.\n\n* Connective tissue\n\nStudies ([American College of Sports Medicine](http://www.acsm.org/docs/current-comments/rtandip.pdf), [Cahill (1978](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/686227), [Stone (1988)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3057317), [Flack, Fleck (1986)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00007256-198603010-00006)) show strength training increases in both the size and strength of ligaments and tendons, possible due to increase in the collagen content within the connective tissue sheaths.\n\n* Bone density\n\nPhysically active persons are at a reduced risk for osteoporosis, fracture or other ailments related to bone deterioration. Resistance training provides the greatest osteogenic (increase in bone mineral density) effect. As lower-body strength levels increase, the incidence of stress fracture is reduced. ([American College of Sports Medicine](http://www.acsm.org/docs/current-comments/rtandip.pdf), [Flack, Fleck (1986)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00007256-198603010-00006))\n\n**Additional precautions**\n\n* Learning correct form (technique) with a low weight.\n* Using higher numbers of repetitions with a lower weight\n\nOther Attributions\n\n* http://www.exrx.net/WeightTraining/Weightlifting/YouthMisconceptions.html\n* http://www.velocitysp.com/multimedia/docs/lehi/Hamill,_Relative_Safety-3.pdf\n\n\nI enjoyed making this.

Hopefully this helps to motivate people who were in my spot last year - tired all the time, lazy, and completely depressed with who I had become. Looking back, I feel ashamed I'd let myself go so much; I don't ever intend to return to that lifestyle again.\n\nSome quick infos:\n\n- The scar is from pyloric stenosis, an operation I had at a few weeks old.\n\n- I am a photographer full time, thus the many cameras.\n\n- Initially Jan through March I was pretty strictly 'cardio only'; April, however, I purchased a full weightlifting cage, barbells, etc. and began to focus on that as my main means of exercise during my cut. I would highly advise anyone who was in a similar spot body-wise to **lift as heavy a weight as you can during your cut!** . I am quite sure that a strong core allowed me to avoid stretch marks and the 'skinnyfat' look of someone who lost weight but still looks..'sloppy'. \n\n- My diet was pretty straight-forward; at least -500 calories a day from my estimated maintenance (though often more then that) based on a protein-rich selection of foods. \n\nAnyways, enough typing. I hope this maybe helps someone out - I still would like to add maybe 15lbs of muscle this year before I feel happy overall, but I'm proud of the first year of my new life. Cheers all.\n\n**edit** I'm 6'1\", late 20's. Oh so late 20's. :(  \n\n\n**edit2**\n\nUnimpressive lifts at present:\n\nBench went from 165 1RM to 240 1RM; squat when I started I thought was 230, but I later realized how poor my form was (I was barely doing knee bends), so now my 1RM Squat is 230 ATG (i think, have it written down in the gym).

At 220 pounds, I totaled 1660 (580 squat, 408 bench, 672 deadlift) and set the state record for my age and weight in the deadlift (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hve3gNOR4C0). I dropped from 220 pounds down to 207, and lost a ton of strength.*\n\nAbout one and a half months ago I started back up. I always felt like my squat was lagging behind, and furthermore, my depth was pretty pathetic, consistently about an inch above parallel due to lack of mobility. I started front squatting on a regular basis and this has been a giant help. If you look at the Bulgarian Method for powerlifting, which is one of the most intense programs I have ever read about, you will notice heavy front squat and back squat are done on a consistent basis. Hence, I have incorporated this into my programming which is already a mixture of the Candito 6 week program and Brandon Lily's \"The Cube\" method.\n\nToday was a great day. Not only did I get into the 6 plate squat club and hit a 6 lb. PR, I went on to get a 26 lb. PR at 605 lbs. I work outside a lot as part of my job and it can be draining, hence I like to think the 605 squat would be easier on a day off.\n\nIf anyone has any questions on how I train please feel to ask. Likewise, if you have any critiques on my form please let me know. I am always glad to receive constructive criticism. \n\nHere is the squat PR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOC62VtGOZ8\n\n*A note about the weight gain. Some might think it's fishy I gained so much weight in such a short period of time. I dirty bulked to gain the weight back. I am not a dietitian, but surely this is not the optimal method to gain weight for most people pursuing a rigorous training schedule. As far as diet is concerned, I focus on getting 220g+ of protein a day in my diet, eat lots of carbs before my workouts and avoid fats, and the rest of the day spend my time trying to ingest as many calories as I can.

It was a blast from the past. I could almost hear Joe Weider yelling at me, \u201cCome on Arnold, pull in your stomach!\u201d\n\nBut as I looked around, I saw people pumping up their chests, doing ab work, and curling. I also saw a plague spreading.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been in a gym recently, you might have noticed it, too. It\u2019s ripping through gym rats like the flu: CHICKEN LEGS.\n\nYou\u2019ve seen the guy in the corner of the gym doing 20 sets of curls Monday, hitting his chest from every angle on Wednesday, and nailing his shoulders on Friday. But what about legs? Somehow, despite all of his workouts, this guy never finds time for his legs. He walks around the gym looking like he might fall over any minute, with his huge upper body and his skinny legs. Or maybe he\u2019s the one who suspiciously wears long sweat pants, even though he\u2019s wearing a tank-top that doesn\u2019t leave anything about his chest or arms to the imagination. This is one of my pet peeves. People love to do their bench-press sets. They love to do their curls. I\u2019ve heard them talk about their hot tub muscles, or say things like, \u201cSun\u2019s out, guns out!\u201d\n\nBut if you are leaving half of your body unworked, you can never consider yourself truly fit. I don\u2019t care how ripped your six-pack is, or if you have 18-inch biceps. I don\u2019t care if you can bench 500 pounds.\n\nWork your legs. I can\u2019t say it enough. You don\u2019t think your glutes, your thighs, and your calves matter? They are some of the biggest muscles in your body. They are your primary movers and shakers. And let\u2019s not forget: A muscular set of legs always looks good.\n\nThe chicken leg phenomenon points to a bigger issue. When you work half of the body over and over but completely neglect the other half, you\u2019re leaving results on the table. You have to focus on the whole body. You need to see the big picture.\n\nIn the same way, even if you aren\u2019t in the gym every day pumping up your pecs\u2014if you just picked up this magazine because you said, \u201cOh, Schwazenschnitzel is on the cover\u201d\u2014you also need to see the big picture.\n\nBecause your health is a big-picture thing. If you\u2019re lifting, but still smoking a pack a day, you\u2019re doing the same thing the curling king with chicken legs is doing: You\u2019re leaving results on the table.\n\nWhatever it means for you, find a big-picture approach to your fitness\u2014and try not to catch that chicken legs virus.\n\nYours in Iron,\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Well put schwartzenschnitzel.

Sorry, I'm not one for fancy mirror work!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Motivation / Joining the Gym**\n\n\n185 was the heaviest and most unhealthy I've ever been, I yo-yo'd and didn't commit to a bunch of things but when I signed up to the gym and got myself into a one year contract I knew I had to be disciplined in my approach. The biggest help for me was using MFP to track my calories, I started to see immediate results and lifting was a lot of fun. I'd say enjoyment was and is the second most important thing for me, the first remaining to be discipline. Honestly, the first 3 weeks of dieting and forcing myself to ride a 4 mile round trip to the gym in November/December was horrid; it's because of this that my feeling of pride for finally making the change was so great. Of course, this was only the beginning. \"Be proud but never satisfied\"\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Diet: Calories and Macros**\n\n\nThe tl;dr part is 1600kcal per day, 110g protein, 50g fat. In addition to this, I adopted a vegan diet around 3 months prior to joining the gym, and I think it's fair to say the majority of my protein comes from Soy. I get close to 10 portions of fruit & veg per day, and have fats from a few different sources. In terms of meal timing, I am a binge eater so I would consume 2-3 meals within around 5 hours and then go without until the morning. I supplemented with protein powder (Soy Isolate because it's cheap) and Creatine Monohydrate. A typical day of eating for me would look something like this:\n\n\n* **Breakfast:** 1 Scoop of protein, 500ml Soy Milk, Creatine (~350 kcal). Optional: 1 banana, 20g flax seeds, 30g peanut butter.\n* **Lunch:** Roughly 4 cups of salad. Spinach, lettuce, cucumber, onion, peppers, tomato (I'm from the UK so don't judge me if these portion sizes are totally off). Always seasoned with black pepper, and I dress it with diluted humous - a few teaspoons of water will do the trick. This is usually 200-300 kcal, I weigh the peppers and tomato as they contain the most calories.\n* **Dinner A:** 1/2 bag of Meat Free Mince (TDP), Spinach, Onion, Pepper, Mushroom, Courgette. Either with diluted humous if I didn't have added fat for breakfast, or with canned tomatoes, and always 1/2 can of mixed beans or red kidney beans. This works out around 700kcal. \n* **Dinner B:** Sweet Potato, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Carrots, Gravy, and something akin to sausage or burger for the protein. If I go with this option, I normally need extra protein as there are no beans/TDP so I will have something extra with my lunch.\n* [Salad + Humous](http://imgur.com/a/KHxds), [Chilli](http://imgur.com/a/rIUsZ)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Training: 3 Days / Week**\n\n\nThe routine I finished was from the wiki, it was called The Average F*n Program (AFP) and it was very bare-bones in terms of volume. All final sets were AMRAP.\n\n\n* Day 1: Squat 3x5, Bench 3x5, Assistance: Chinups\n* Day 2: Deadlift 3x5, OHP 3x5, Assistance: Chinups\n* Day 3: Squat 3x5, Row 3x5, Assistance: Dips\n\n\nI progressed linearly on this program for around 3 months, then my OHP and Bench began to stall. Before I get into how I changed the program, I want to address some issues I had with squatting. Initially, I couldn't squat safely, my back would round and I would bend over. I owe my progress to this subreddit in that regard, my mobility increased a lot [over 4-5 weeks](http://imgur.com/a/Qquu0) thanks to [Tykato](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-7E1nG01ymuypsBm5E6aNg). In addition to not being able to squat, I was in pain from deadlifting and noticed my form was a lot better pulling Sumo so I reset my weight and started over, my deadlift and squat are still progressing linearly.\n\n\nI finished this program with 3x5 on OHP: 50kg, Bench: 77.5kg, Squat ~ 40kg, Deadlift ~ 100kg.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI got some help in the stupid questions thread and altered the program to what it is today, again all final sets were AMRAP. [Here's the spreadsheet I used](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wmcoZYGNABHUbtGhlhlbZQ-i8nLlylDUCpvnp-wFE4g/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n* Day 1: Squat 3x5, Bench 3x5 (at 80%, 90%, 100%), Row 3x5. Assistance: Face pulls, chinups.\n* Day 2: Deadlift 3x5, OHP 3x5 (at 80%, 90%, 100%). Assistance: Plank, knee raises, roll-outs.\n* Day 3: Squat 3x5, Bench 4x5, OHP 4x5 (both at 70%, 80%, 90%, 70%). Assistance: Face pulls, chinups.\n\n\nSo the main thing about this programming is that I used %s for my OHP and Bench Press as they had stalled, whereas I continued to do sets across for other exercises as they were continuing to progress linearly. The spreadsheet uses %s for all of the lifts from week 1 though.\n\n\nI finished with this program 3 weeks ago, which is when the after picture was taken. My lifts were OHP 57.5kg (1x5), Bench 85kg (1x5), Deadlift 120kg (3x5), Squat 75kg (3x5). It's incredibly awkward that my squat and deadlift are progressing at such contrasting rates to my upper body movements, but I can tell that they are nearing the point where they won't continue to progress linearly. I have recently swapped to %s for deadlifts at 135kg for 1x5.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI can't comment much on the last 3 weeks, I have been greatly enjoying my first \"5/3/1\" cycle - I use quotation marks because I am still using 3x5 for my Deadlift and Squat as the weight is still increasing every week. I think using joker sets and FSL on deadlift and squats has been a great addition though, as well as using Wendler's recommended assistance exercises in a superset format. This week I set a PR for my OHP at 67.5kg and my Bench Press at 102.5kg.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Goals**\n\n\nUnfortunately, my hip adductor has been giving me a lot of grief lately and I haven't been able to deadlift or squat this week - and I doubt I will be able to next week either. With that said, my goal now is to reach a 1000lbs total and stay within a weight range so my clothes still fit me. My current lifts are at 245 / 225 / 330 in S/B/D and I would like to reach 350/250/400. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThanks for reading, it's nice to actually reflect on my own progress and see how far I've come - looking over my old spreadsheets and Rep PRs, seeing my previous 1RM being used now as a warmup weight, it only serves to push me forward.

I want to do the same this summer but am having problems of getting to the gym and staying consistent. Last year I was super consistent all summer doing PHUL and missed probably a maximum of 2-3 days for 3 months. This summer, things are different. I'm trying to stay consistent and want to have a productive summer, working out, working a job and just improving myself. I am a fairly conscientious person, meaning I get guilty when I'm being unproductive or not doing the things I should be doing. Right now, I get thoughts of not going to the gym and they stick, they are hard to get rid of and make me dread going to the gym. It's weird because I understand and know how good I feel after the gym, but I'm irrationally dreading going to the gym. I like my program (doing PHUL this summer again), my gym, and the time when I gym. But, I'm still getting thoughts of dread going to the gym, then feel guilty about it, because I'm not staying consistent when I want to.\n\nTrying to unplug my emotions and just getting to the gym hasn't worked that well, because I just think I'm lying to myself and there is a deeper issues at hand than some feelings taking over my thoughts. \n\nAny ideas or knowledge that would help me get out of this tough spot?\n\nThanks.\n\nEDIT: I got lucky with this post getting big.

I had a poor mind-muscle connection and I had a hard time really working the biceps effectively.  I would feel soreness in my forearm flexors and deltoids and to a lesser extent the long head of my biceps, but I couldn't really build the biceps muscle itself, especially the short head that makes up the thick inner portion- the \"peak\" of the muscle that shows when you fully flex the muscle.\n\nI've learned that basically what was happening is that my forearm flexors, specifically the brachialis and brachioradialis were doing the bulk of the work in my \"biceps\" workout.  This make sense because their job is to flex the elbow and they insert much lower on the arm than the biceps, so they are able to perform elbow flexion more efficiently than the biceps.\n\n[Here is a picture that is helpful.](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=2817331&d=1288643063)\n\nNormally I am not a fan of arbitrary supersets for different muscle groups.  A lot of people do multiple exercises for the same muscle group simply because different must be better.  In some cases this is true, as you can work different aspects of the muscle group especially if they perform multiple functions.  For instance, the triceps not only extend the elbow but they also help extend the shoulder joint in the sagittal plane.  Thus to work the whole triceps you need to do both.  For instance, doing regular tricep pressdowns as well as straight-arm pressdowns (doing this on a lat-pull machine is heavenly.)\n\n**The solution:**\n\nI've devised the following superset with the goal of pre-exhausting the forearms flexors before working the biceps themselves, particularly the short head.\n\nThe exercises, performed in order and without rest, are:\n\n1. [Cable hammer curls.](http://www.bryankrahn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/002-Biceps-STANDING-CABLE-CURL-WITH-ROPE.jpg) You can also do regular hammer curls but I feel using the rope attachment with a pulley is superior.  Perform with a weight that will get you to muscle failure in 8-15 reps.  Do a few cheat reps at the end where you really focus on the top (fully contracted) position of the exercise.  This should completely fatigue your brachioradialis because when your hands are in a neutral position (thumbs pointing up, palms facing together) the BR is dominant in elbow flexion.\n\n2. [Reverse grip ez-curl bar curls.](http://munfitnessblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/reversed-ez-bar-curl-for-forearms-and-biceps.jpg) Grip the bar with palms down and thumbs on the underside of the bar.  This position will maximize the role of the brachialis, completely neutralize the short head of the biceps, and greatly weaken the BR and biceps long head. I recommend bringing your elbows backwards slightly so that you can get maximum load in the fully contracted position.  Again, perform to failure including some cheat reps.  We want the forearms flexors to be massacred before our biceps works.  \n\n3. [Concentration curls](http://workoutlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/watermarked/Concentration_Curls1.png)  Use a LIGHT dumbbell, probably 50% or even less of the weight you typically use when you perform your regular, bouncy, worthless bro curls.  I am 225 lbs and can bullshit curl 40lbs dumbbells all day but I use 15lbs for my concentration curls.  You can perform these seated or in a standing/bent over sort of position.  The key word here is **supination**. Supination is what you are doing when you turn your hands from palms-down to palms-up.  The majority of weight should thus rest on the fat part of your outer palm.  We do this because the short head of the biceps is primarily responsible for supination.  Your elbow should be down so that the area just above the elbow is resting against the inside of your knee/thigh.  Your forearm should basically be pointed across the gap between your legs.  Curl the weight up.  When you reach the top the head of the dumbbell nearest to your body should touch somewhere on your chest.  **Squeeze, motherfucker, squeeze.** Pretend that you are trying to rotate that dumbbell through your weak, pathetic chest. **Squeeze.**  Prepare to feel your short biceps head spring to life.  \n\n4.  Cry.  Repeat for 3-5 sets.\n\n\nYou can swap the order of #1 and #2.  I'm experimenting to find if one is superior or not.  However #3 must be performed last.  I highly recommend using a pulley, ez curl bar, and dumbbell because you can put them all out in front of you and perform exercises rapidly without having to change attachments or hog the curl bar rack.\n\nEnjoy.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "How to murder your biceps, especially if you are tall.", "post_ups": 1882, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/34gkf9/how_to_murder_your_biceps_especially_if_you_are/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:18.439705", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "UpsilonPHI", "post_created_utc": 1441645432.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1441683390.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "3jzohv", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 182, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1882, "post_selftext": "**Lower crossed syndrome**: It is imperative when looking at preventive exercise, to start by looking at imbalances in different muscle groups. Imbalances occur when opposing muscle groups are in a constant shortened or lengthened position. In the case of looking at muscle imbalances in the hips and legs, it\u2019s important to look at several key muscle groups in the anterior (front) and posterior (back) sides of the lower body. Most commonly, people will have the imbalances discussed in this post. Generally, you will have **weak** abdominals crossed with weakness in the gluteus maximus muscles. Furthermore, you will have **tightness** in the erector muscles/ fascia, as well as tightness in both hip flexors (psoas m. group). The aforementioned impairments cause an **[Anterior Pelvic Tilt](http://i.imgur.com/jxXcxr9.png)** of the pelvis. There is another lower crossed syndrome in which there are different muscles in a shortened/ lengthened position causing  [Posterior Pelvic Tilt](http://i.imgur.com/7C030lE.png), but that will be for a different post. Also, there are several scenarios of upper-crossed syndrome which will be discussed in another post as well.  \n\n\n**Causes**- Overuse, improper movement mechanics, faulty work ergonomics, imbalance in muscle strength/ length, increased muscle tone. Many people have tight hip flexors from sitting for prolonged periods of time. Because you are sitting, your hip flexors shorten, and the body adaptively shortens these muscles into this new position.\n\n**Effects**- Anterior pelvic tilt resulting in low back, SI joint, hip, knee, and ankle pain. Increase in compression at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 segments. Also, leads to change in posture and other chronic conditions. Additionally, to compensate for excessive hip flexor tightness, the hamstrings start firing to posteriorly rotate the pelvis. Constant firing of the hamstrings will cause an increase in tone in these muscles, leading to a hamstring dominant firing pattern with walking/ running (glute max should be extending the hip as this is the biggest extensor). Also, anterior pelvic tilt causes femur internal rotation and tibia internal rotation, which can lead to excessive ankle pronation (causes flat fleet), and creates a whole array of problems.\n\n**What to look for**- [Tightness of rectus femoris or iliopsoas via the Thomas Test](http://www.pthaven.com/page/show/157779-thomas-test). \n\n*Lack of Full hip extension with knee flexion less than 45\u00b0 indicates iliopsoas tightness. If full hip extension is reached in this position but the person still has knee extension, it would indicates rectus femoris tightness. If any hip external rotation is observed it may indicate ITB tightness.^1\n\n**Potential solutions**:\n\n1. If you have tight hip flexors (iliopsoas), do these exercises: [Iliopsoas stretch 1](http://imgur.com/6fZkZuM), [Iliopsoas stretch 2](http://imgur.com/pXWxmJx)\n\n2. If you have tight erectors, do these stretches: [Erector Stretch 1](http://imgur.com/7zomcd4), [Erector Stretch 2](http://imgur.com/jDN5PnF)\n\n3. If you have tight hamstrings, stretch your hamstrings in a manner you prefer. Stretches should be held for 10 seconds, and repeated 10 times. Also, if you are having tight hamstrings you may want to try rolling out your plantar fascia with a tennis ball, baseball, or lacrosse ball--[Plantar Fascia Rolling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhvDEKI69-M)\n\n4. For core strengthening you should be focusing on [Transverse Abdominis Exercises]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8O04WLXFt8), [Internal/ External oblique exercises]( http://imgur.com/VyCjEgH), and [Multifidus Exercises]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t9bZpl4EEY).\n\n5. This is not an all inclusive list of exercises however, it is a beginning guideline on what to begin strengthening/ stretching.\n\n6. Weak hip extension, focus on training glue max. You can perform many variations of hip extension exercise that is within you your fitness and comfort level. Some examples would be double/ single leg bridging, bridging on a foam disc, hip thrusts with weight, and of course the most functional exercise, squats (ensuring proper form). \n\n\n1.Magee DJ.

This has been long overdue but I recently got a good push from a number of you. /appreciate\n\n\n**MY STORY:**\n\nEmbarrassingly, it all began with a tragic ice-skating accident. I mustered up the confidence to attempt an axel on the ice, which was the best idea I\u2019ve had since wearing a thong for my high schools opposite sex day.\n\nHalfway through my spin, the toe pick on my right skate got caught in the ice as I\u2019m rotating and SNAP, there went my fibula, right in half.\n\nMy punishment was 3 months in a cast and crutches. My activity declined to 0, but my appetite did not. I ordered take out at almost every meal, picking all the wrong choices and just when it couldn\u2019t get worse, I became incredibly addicted to video games. Since sports were no longer an option, video games filled the competitive void that was missing.\n\nOn a real note\n- this was one of the darkest moments of my life. I hadn\u2019t experienced isolation like this before, being unable to do a lot of activities I loved. I (an extrovert by nature) became considerably introverted and locked myself away in my room for hours upon end every day. \n\n3 months later I was a competitive and feared gamer (n00bs), but it wasn\u2019t until then, when I was out of my cast and left the man cave, which I came to realize I was no longer Batman in Gotham City. I was his arch nemesis the Penguin, relatively speaking.\n\nOver the next 2 years, I made a life changing transformation that changed the way I thought, the way I felt, how I carried myself, and what I believed was achievable. A lot of trial and error was involved, and there are certainly things I would have changed, but this is how I got there.\n\n \n\n**MY WORKOUT:**\n\nI never worked out on the weekends, not because I couldn\u2019t, but because weekends are too unpredictable. Relatives come to visit, bros want to hang out, girlfriend wants to go for a spa day, etc. I worked an 8-hour shift, Monday through Friday, and treat my workouts as an extension of my workday.\n\nI cycled my workouts every 6-8 weeks, taking a week deload for every month of training, so in this case, roughly 2 weeks in-between each cycle.\n\nYour body responds differently to certain types of training just as it does to particular foods, and this is where trial and error comes in. There are many training types that will work, but you want to find the intensity, frequency, volume, and training type that work best for you.\n\nI always rotated between a strength cycle (4-6 reps) and hypertrophy cycle (8-12 reps).\n\nI experimented with many training modalities ranging from 2-day full body splits to 6-day splits that hit every muscle group twice per week. I also tried separate resting protocols, ranging from your traditional 3-minute rest between sets to different types of MRT (Metabolic Resistance Training) where I did reps for time with as little as 20 seconds of rest between sets. What I eventually found to work best for me was a 5-day hypertrophy split, Monday \u2013 Friday working separate muscle groups each day paired with traditional rest times between exercises (1-2 minutes).\n\nI\u2019m an 20/80 guy, meaning I believe that 20% of the exercises gets you 80% of the results. I stuck with many of the basic compound & power lifts for both cycles (strength and hypertrophy), but added more targeted exercises in my hypertrophy cycles to focus on definition in a few key areas.\n\n\n\n**KEYS TO MY WORKOUT SUCCESS:**\n\n* Correct compensated movement patterns.\n\n    People joke about Quasimodo but I\u2019ve seen a few of these mythical creatures lurking in the gym, and we can best assume it\u2019s in part to compensated movement patterns. Before you begin lifting seriously, you need to have your foundation in check. Your form should be spot on before beginning any lifting program; otherwise you risk building strength on top of dysfunction.  This will lead to muscular imbalances, compensated movement patterns, and ultimately injury.\n\n* Train in proper postural alignment.\n\n    Ensure that with each movement, you\u2019re going through the motions of your lift with proper posture and joint alignment. If you\u2019re doing a seated cable row with your shoulders rounded forward (internally rotated), the rotator cuff muscles are extended, the anterior deltoid is shortened, and you\u2019re developing the muscle fibers in this position. Again, avoid the Quasimodo.\n\n* Make a mind-body connection with your muscles.\n\n    This sounds like a total hoax but I kid you not. You have to make a mind-body connection with your muscles, and it\u2019s a completely different sensation than lifting the weight up and putting it down. If you\u2019re doing a pull-up, this means engaging the core, contracting the musculature involved (primarily the lats), and imagining the muscles being worked throughout each inch of the lift. Help your body connect the dots on every rep.  \n\n* Don\u2019t bullshit your workout, get in the zone.\n\n    You need to take your workout seriously. When you\u2019re at the gym, it\u2019s not time to chat with your friend on the phone, check your email, or mingle with others for minutes on end. You need to make the mind-body connection with your muscles, make sure you are in proper postural alignment with every rep, ensure your form is nothing short of perfection, and strictly adhere to your rest times. That\u2019s a lot of shit, and you need to be on top of it.\n\n \n\n**MY AB WORKOUT:**\n\nLet me make clear that abs are made in the kitchen, not the gym (upcoming blog post on this). Your diet exposes your abs, but it\u2019s the work you put in the gym that carves them. You don\u2019t eat a couple pieces of celery, 3 grapes, and a carrot stick and leave the house with a shredded 6 pack.\n\nMy abdominal workout consisted of 4 ab workouts per week, with 2 ab exercises per workout. I chose exercises that allowed me to apply progressive overload, just as I do with every other muscle group. Rather than increasing the intensity of an exercise by increasing the number of reps, I did so by increasing the resistance or difficulty.\n\nHere is an example ab routine from one of my 5-day splits:\n\n\n* Monday (exercises superset, 2 rounds)\n\n    Weighted Sit-ups: 25lbs @ 20 reps\n\n    Hanging Knee Raises: 15 reps @ 2-0-2-0 tempo\n\n    60 sec rest\n\n* Tuesday (exercises superset, 2 rounds)\n\n    Plank: 1 minute\n\n    Weighted Cycling Russian Twist: 25 lbs @ 15 reps/side\n\n    60 sec rest\n\n* Thursday (exercises superset, 2 rounds)\n\n    Barbell Floor Sweeper: 185 lbs @ 12 reps\n\n    Weighted Toe Crunch: 25 lbs @ 20 reps\n\n    60 sec rest\n\n* Friday (exercises superset, 2 rounds)\n\n    Decline Reverse Crunch: 12 reps @ 2-0-2-0 tempo\n\n    Side Plank: 1 minute (both sides)\n\n    60 sec rest\n\n\n[Here's a copy of the ab workout](http://thryv.com/workout/plans/467)\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that I did no more than 4 sets of abdominal work for each ab day, with reps staying below 20. I\u2019m a firm believer in following progressive overload with volume low and intensity high for abdominals.\n\nThe exercises above were selected because you can progressively overload them by increasing the resistance for ab exercises that utilized weight, or increase the intensity for others by increasing the difficulty of the exercise [i.e., Plank --> TRXPlank, Hanging Knee Raises --> Hanging Leg Raises]\n\n\n\n**MY DIET & SUPPLEMENTS:**\n\nI didn\u2019t count a single calorie. While I did attempt to (a short-lived 2 days), tracking with pen/paper was about as exciting as watching grass grow and every food-tracking tool I tried was inefficient and frustrating.\n\nWhat I did count was the single handedly most important macro, protein. I always shot for roughly 1.5g/kg (~0.7g/lb) which was surprisingly easier to achieve than I thought.\n\nOther than counting protein, my dietary regiment consisted of common sense, balance, and a dash of bacon. \n\nBefore long, eating became a chore. I was never quite bothered with cooking before (although I am now), so my laziness forced me to eat the same breakfast, lunch, and dinner (for the most part) at every meal. Food was there to serve the purpose of giving my body the energy and nutrients it needed to continue growing.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what \u201cPaleo\u201d was at the time I was going through my transformation, but my dietary habits consisted of the same principles the Paleo diet follows. For that reason, I\u2019m going to skip the diet details here and send you over to [/r/Paleo](http://www.reddit.com/r/paleo)\n\n**Supplements**\nMy goal was (and still is) to stay completely natural, so for that reason I only used 3 supplements and a fat burn stack.\n\n    Pre-Workout: NO-Xplode (cycled)\n    Post-Workout: Whey Protein\n    Night-Time: Casein Protein\n    Fat Burn Stack: Green Tea Extract, CLA, Fish Oil\n\nPertaining to the Fat Burn Stack, I\u2019ve been asked a number of times how this helped and honestly, I can\u2019t say. I don\u2019t have any data to quantify the difference it made in my personal transformation, although there are a number of people who live by it.\n\nBut on a side note, fish burps are the worst, seriously.\n\n\n\n**KEY THINGS THAT KEPT ME HEALTHY DURING MY TRAINING:**\n\n* Dynamic Warm-ups\n\n    You need to prepare your muscles for the movements and stresses they are about to endure. Working on chest? Do some Rolling T-Pushups to work the concentric/eccentric movements of the chest/triceps and stabilization of the shoulders. Leg day? Get in some lunge + rotation\u2019s to warm-up the lower body musculature / core or perform a few alternating groiners.\n\n* Adequate Rest\n\n    I can\u2019t stress this enough. Not just rest between workouts, but rest between exercises. The rest time between exercises will vary depending on your rep range (3-6, 8-12, 15+), and training modality (MRT).  It\u2019s completely natural to be itching to workout on your off days but stay disciplined. Exercise induces micro tears and inadequate rest is the quickest 1-way ticket to overtraining.\n\n* Foam Rolling\n\n    Also known as SMR (Self Myofascial Release). I attribute much of my recovery speed to foam rolling. It provides a good deep tissue massage and increases blood flow to the muscle, reducing your recovery time between workouts. To the previous point about exercise induced micro tears, foam rolling helps to break up adhesions in the muscle.\n\n\n\n**MORALE OF THE STORY:**\n\nGetting to 5% was one of the most difficult things I\u2019ve ever done, but also one of my greatest accomplishments.\n\nYou always hear the clich\u00e9 \u201cfitness isn\u2019t temporary, it\u2019s a life long journey\u201d, and this is true. Therefore you need to begin with a solid foundation and work your way from the basics.\n\nMy advice?\n\nExperiment with different training modalities and focus on outcomes. Quantify your results and understand your body. Then keep your diet and workout SPE; Sustainable, Practical, Enjoyable.\n\nIt\u2019s great to have your fitness idols and strive to mimic their physique but you have to be patient, persistent, and persevere. You will hit plateaus, need to overcome mental barriers, and occasionally frequent the ideas of calling it quits but remember everyone started from the bottom, even Arnold.\n\n- KB\n\nEDIT - Text formatting\n\nEDIT - [3rd Picture with my head attached](http://i.imgur.com/KKdszHX.png) : [4th picture in the same room but different time (a little before)](http://i.imgur.com/dLNosPz.jpg)\n\nEDIT - Meetings and training for a few hours, be back around 7:30 est\n\nEDIT - [Current picture of me now for those of you asking](http://i.imgur.com/VA7iiM4.jpg)\n\nEDIT - I apologize for a typo I completely overlooked.

I\u2019ve been lurking here for a while reading and seeing  different transformations and trying to retain as many tips as possible to help me in my journey.  I\u2019ve been hesitant to post a picture on here because I don\u2019t really see my results as good but figured that it wouldn\u2019t hurt at this point and maybe I could get some tips that are geared more towards me.\n\n**A little about me.**\nI was never athletic growing up.  At home we ate lots of greasy, fried and delicious Caribbean foods.  I was never what you would call \u201cFat\u201d but I was definitely flabby.  I guess that being over 6\u2019 tall since I was in Junior high helped hide it.\n\nI was in the military for 4 years and managed to do the bare minimum as far as physical fitness was concerned but never achieved anything remotely resembling muscular, or having abs of any sort.  After the military I started experimenting with \u201ceating less\u201d and counting calories which resulted in weight loss that I quickly regained once my eating went back to normal.  I never incorporated exercise into these attempts at losing weight.\n\nEventually I got married to a woman that just accepted me as I was even though she did always say that it would be nice if I took better care of myself.\n\n**How change Started**\nAs I approached the age of 40, so did my waist size.  I realized that I was always tired and winded.  I slept horribly and I always woke up with back aches.  It was common for me to wake up with numbness in my fingers\u2026and apparently I snored really bad.  I decided that I needed to change and in January of 2014 I picked up a used bowflex sport and started to work out doing the bowflex body plan.  I started counting calories and began to feel some changes after 3 weeks.  Unfortunately, I immediately got two rotator cuff injuries due to what I can only explain as the Blowflex sport\u2019s horrible design.   I couldn\u2019t put my clothes on\u2026.let alone work out.  I had to stop.  Depressed about this my weight ballooned to almost 240.\n\nBy the end of 2014 my shoulders had healed and a friend of mine suggested I buy a Fitbit to help me track my steps and estimate my calories burned.  I got the fitbit, a bench and some free weights and began working out again.\n\n**Stats Starting Out**\nSquat \u2013 90 lbs\nBench \u2013 75 lbs\nBarbell Curl \u2013 50 lbs\nTricep Ext \u2013 50 lbs\nShoulder Press \u2013 45 lbs\n\nWhen I first started I did a full body workout 3 times a week.  After about 3 months I switched to  PPL.  I then switched that to  Chest/Arms, Back/Shoulders, Legs.  I would take one day off and repeat, then 2 days off.  My off days were never the same.   On my off days I would run 2-3 miles.\n\nThe weight began to drop and I started to get some definition, but I wasn\u2019t necessarily getting bigger.  My waist went from 38 to 34.   I\u2019m not sure how accurate the fitbit measures calories burned but it said I was burning around 3100 per day which is in line with what most online calculators estimate.  I was trying to eat 2100 calories per day and have a 1000 calorie deficit.  I really didn\u2019t pay any attention to macros and probably was only getting about 50-90 grams of protein a day.\n\nThen one day I started to have pain in my knees from the running so I began to run less and less.  To the point where I was running maybe once a month if that.  The weight started to come back even though I was allegedly still eating at a 1000 calorie deficit.  My buddy that suggested the fitbit suggested that I start getting at least 200 grams of protein a day so I started doing that\u2026through  lots of chicken and also protein shakes.  I also tried to keep the carbs down to 100 grams or less per day.  \n\nI have been doing that for about the last 9 months and I guess I\u2019m having trouble analyzing exactly what has happened.  My weight which had started at 240 and dropped all the way down to 211 is now up to 233.  Psychologically I feel bad that my weight is creeping up like that.  Everyone tells me not to focus on the weight and focus on body composition.  That\u2019s a problem too.  My body fat was 30 when I started and had dropped down to 17 with all the running.  Then I stopped running and it\u2019s gone back up to 26%.  As you can see from the pictures, it certainly looks like I\u2019ve done something.  I think I\u2019ve gotten bigger and I\u2019ve definitely gotten stronger.  My numbers now are: \n\nSquat \u2013 200 lbs\nBench \u2013 190 lbs\nBarbell Curl \u2013 90 lbs\nTricep Ext \u2013 125 lbs\nShoulder Press \u2013 120 lbs\n\n\nI feel like I\u2019m struggling to lose fat.  I\u2019m getting big but without much definition.  My waist size is back up to 36.   I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s my diet that's off\u2026.if I need to start doing cardio again\u2026.or if I just don\u2019t lift enough.  The size I\u2019ve gained makes me think it\u2019s not a matter of not lifting enough and probably has more to do with diet and cardio\u2026.but I don\u2019t know where to begin.\n\nI\u2019m currently not doing any cardio but just picked up Bowflex Maxtrainer M5 (used and cheap!) in hopes that I can do it without hurting my knees.\n\nAs far as my diet goes, it\u2019s pretty varied.  Every day my main focus is to get 200 grams of protein, 24 grams of fiber, keep my calories to about 2000 and avoid anything fried.  Breakfast is usually some bran cereal, a couple of scrambled eggs and some almond milk.  Sometimes I\u2019ll have a protein shake instead of the eggs.   For snacks I have tuna or a protein shake.  Dinner and lunches tend to be grilled chicken breast, brown rice, black beans and salad.  If calories and macros allow, I will occasionally have some dessert.\n\nOkay, I\u2019m sorry for such a long post but I\u2019m hoping you might be able to read this and offer some advice.  I really appreciate any input and will take it to heart.  And if it makes any difference\u2026.I\u2019ve been told that I have a little body dysmophic disorder\u2026..but I really do see myself as fat and feel uncomfortable taking my shirt off in front of others.  My weight, waist size and body fat % reinforce that.\n\nEdit:  I was able to find a picture of where my body was headed before I stopped running and cardio.\n[This was about 5 months into working out and running](http://imgur.com/eIeqg77)\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "45 y/o 6'2 240lb to 233lb two year transformation", "post_ups": 1866, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5j7oi5/45_yo_62_240lb_to_233lb_two_year_transformation/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:18.439705", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "BePatient7", "post_created_utc": 1451671555.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1451686139.0, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "3z1eiy", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 162, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1869, "post_selftext": "It has been about one year since I began seriously doing Calisthenics & Gymnastics. \nI\u2019d like to share my story in hopes of providing some inspiration for the New Year!  \n\n\n\nThree years ago, I started to battle with an Eating Disorder which could have killed me. (On multiple occasions it almost did.) Without getting too nitty gritty, let\u2019s just say when I was very ill my heart was struggling to beat more than 30 bpm. \n\n**Backstory**\n\nI\u2019ve always loved doing amazing things with my body: movement gives me confidence, joy and relief. During grade school, I spent a lot of my time practicing/competing in freestyle skiing, avidly mountain biking and running track. I was relatively happy and had love for life until my senior year of high school, were things started to take a turn for the worse. \n\n\nOver the next 3 years I experienced a bout of severe injuries, was diagnosed with chronic illness and the family experienced a cascade of tragedy (death, parents divorced, dog passing). The injuries had left me permanently incapable of pursuing the sports I loved and I fell into a state of depression. To make things more difficult I had moved away to go to University and was in an unhealthy living situation. The program I enrolled in was incredibly demanding (60 hrs / week) and it compounded my depression. I stopped doing all of the things I loved, isolated myself from friends and barely had any time to take care of myself. \n\nFeeling out of control, I took up running to escape from my problems. I initially didn\u2019t have much intention of losing weight but it slowly began to come off. It wasn\u2019t long before I started getting compliments from classmates and I also noticed my run times improving. I began tracking calories, becoming increasingly more rigid with my diet and pushing harder on my runs. I finally felt I had something I could control: how much I weighed and how far I could run. This was short lived as my body rapidly dropped weight, it began to rebel: my mood was terrible, performance sucked and l felt foggy all the time.\n\nAfter you reach a certain BMI, it seems that you lose rational thought and kind of works like an addiction; I couldn\u2019t justify eating over 800 Calories in a day if I hadn\u2019t ran enough. \nToo make a long story short, I wound up weighing 100lbs at 5\u20199\u201d and found myself in a hospital bed. The next 2 years were spent in and out of treatment facilities and attempting to finish school. I told myself I could get better on my own but remained an extremely low weight; I was still very attached to my eating disorder. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until January of 2015 that I looked in the mirror one day and decided I wanted this year to be different. At the time, I came across a video of Ido Portal doing calisthenics and I was amazed. I remember thinking to myself \u201cThat actually looks like fun and I want to try that.\u201d  I attempted my first Calisthenics workout and I needless to say I absolutely sucked at it. It inspired me: It didn\u2019t feel like a \u201cworkout\u201d it felt like play, it was a new challenge and it made me forget about calories, numbers & times.\n\nCalisthenics was not the sole reason for my recovery but it did finally motivate me to reach out for the help that I needed. I got in touch with an excellent therapist and started tackling my fears, eating more and digging into why this happened in the first place.\n\n\nIt\u2019s been quite the battle since then, a lot of healing has taken place and a lot more is still needed. Recovery is a journey and it\u2019s been the greatest learning experience of my entire life; I was assigned this mountain to show it could be moved.\n\n\n\n\n**Progress That I made in 2015**\n\n[Before/After Photo](http://i.imgur.com/EHt9fF8.jpg?1)\n\n[Front after](http://i.imgur.com/z0BFEeC.jpg)\n\n[Extremely sick](http://i.imgur.com/KE7N9l9.jpg)\n\n* 1 Chin up -> [Chin up + 65lbs](https://www.instagram.com/p/_dQTF5P12t/?taken-by=positivelymove)\n* No handstand -> [Handstand for >1 minute](http://imgur.com/TjOnMgJ) \n* Bench press 55lbs -> 175 lbs (only train push up variations)\n* Deadlift 95lbs -> 275 X 3\n* Barely hanging on bar -> [Back Lever](https://www.instagram.com/p/4wslmfv15U/?taken-by=positivelymove)\n* 5 second foot supported L sit-> [20 second full L- sit](http://i.imgur.com/DrWGQ3P.jpg)\n\n**In this past year, I\u2019ve also had pretty awesome experiences:**\n\n[Did Handstands everywhere](https://www.facebook.com/100009133875431/videos/1522672378047210/?pnref=story)\n\n[I ran two spartan races](http://imgur.com/5f5ioI0)\n\n[I did a tough mudder](http://i.imgur.com/0GBR7jH.jpg)\n\n[Got certified as a yoga instructor](http://imgur.com/BWgWG0G)\n\n\n\nMovement is love, movement is life :)\n\nHuge Thanks to the supportive community at /r/bodyweightfitness\n\nGoing to keep working on doing my thing in 2016 \n\n**Thanks for reading.**\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "(M21) One year Eating disorder recovery & Calisthenics", "post_ups": 1869, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3z1eiy/m21_one_year_eating_disorder_recovery_calisthenics/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:18.439705", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "JamieT567", "post_created_utc": 1367448610.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "1dih6u", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 575, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1869, "post_selftext": "So I've been looking at a new gym, I joined about a month ago but I has having second thoughts about it, wasn't sure if I wanted to stay or and what not.

I know this! The post is meant to highlight trial and error a lot of people go through until you finally get it right. \n\nSo 4 years ago I decided enough is enough.  No more smoking and drinking on the daily, feeling sorry for myself for snacking on shit every night and ultimately taking it out on everyone around me because I was unhappy and lethargic.\nI joined the gym with a friend and I've got to say that although this was a good start and I used these first couple years to get a good understanding of the equipment and what I enjoyed lifting, I spent a lot of time just winging it and never feeling satisfied with the workouts. I wish I'd researched more and put more effort in to my recovery and nutrition.\nIn December 2015 I wrote a real routine down which consisted of 3x full body splits where I would hit all the important areas of my body with different exercises: squats, lunges, leg press, OHP side and front raises, bent and straight leg dead lifts, flat, incline and decline bench. The rep ranges where typically 4x8-10.\nI would also do a forth day in the gym at the weekend where I would do whatever I felt, but would always do extra pull ups, dead lifts and squats or atleast a variation of these.\nI was getting good results, but still not sleeping enough, putting too much pressure on myself to do other hobbies and activities and my nutrition wasn't great, most importantly I never ate enough because I was scared of getting fat.\n\nSo next I began a low carb (modified keto diet) that lasted about 6 months from March 2016 until August. I lost 25 pounds but I began to over do it with the peanut butter and other nuts and the body fat wouldn't drop.\n\nNext I got a bike and began to cycle to and from work 2 miles each way and to the gym and back 4 times a week (roughly the same distance).\nStarted doing yoga at home on rest days and extra abs as well. I would sometimes throw in a 5k run Sunday night if I was bored/motivated enough.\n\nI now force myself to get into bed by 10pm and aim to put my phone on airplane mode by 10:30.\n\nIn the last 2 weeks I have upped my micronutrients and began to monitor my macros and calories going in.\nI'm eating 3300 cals and I've upped my carbs from under 100g to 200g to begin with. \nMacros are C25% P25% F50%\nI will increase carbs if I feel that I need to.\nI'm currently 198 pounds 6 foot.\nI don't have a weight goal as this is the first time monitoring calories. If I go up or down it doesn't bother me, I'll see how I feel and look and go from that.\nMy legs have grown significantly, but I haven't photographed them yet.\n\nI have changed my routine this week also,but I'm still working it out so I can't really post about it yet.  Basically it's heavy weights working on a proper split routine and less reps (around 4x6) 3 days a week, then on a Sunday I smash higher reps till failure. I also train with better intentions mentally, I don't just do the reps I have written I'm my little journal, if I can il bang another rep out or add a plate and just go for it.\n\nI wish I knew what I now know at the beginning, but researching and using your body for your own experiments is part of the fun. \nStretching I feel is over looked, for me it helps me to unwind and feel more in tune with my body. \n\nI don't ever train 1 rep max so I'm not sure of the numbers sorry\n\nEDIT:\nMAX LIFTS 4 sets x 6 reps\n\nDeadlift - 330lbs\nSquat - 286lbs\nOHP - 127lbs\nBench - 198lbs\n\nEDIT 2: For those interested in the nutrition.\n\nWhen I was on a low carb diet i found it really easy to cook the meals as they were fast. Only problem was coming off sugar was really hard for me, I felt like total shit for a couple weeks.\nI also believe that keto diets are great for all day energy and stop those hunger pangs mid day, however, I felt like I had less energy when training, but that's just me, I know it works wonders for people.\n\nI would eat microwaved frozen cod,2 eggs in coconut oil with avacado, spinach and some seeds for breakfast at 7am.\nTake a bullet proof coffee to work.\nI'd take a protein smoothy to work with kale, pear/apple, almonds,ginger, garlic,cucumber and celery to have at 10-11am.\nThen for lunch at 12:30 it'd be brocolli, carrots and fatty meat  my favourite was lamb mince.\nI'd then eat nothing until dinner at 5:30 which my wife and I would take turns making. Typically this was salmon/beef/lamb/chicken thighs with skin on with sweet potatoe,butternut squash,carrot and greens.\nFor snacks it'd be protein shakes and spoons of peanut butter and mainly brazil nuts.\nI calculated nothing and began to bulk slowly.\n\nNow that I'm eating 200g of carbs my day looks more like this.\n\nBreakfast is porridge with peanut butter or weetabix and milk, eggs in coconut oil and spinach.\nBullet proof coffee with whole milk instead of cream like when on the keto diet.\nI'd make the same smoothy but make it larger and just swap the almonds for 50g of raw oats. Half comes to work and half stays in the fridge at home.\nLunch tends to be brown rice, lean meat or tuna with veg, nuts and seeds.\nDinner is usually the same actually, sometimes more greens than sweet potatoes if not training that night or planning on having dark chocolate with milk as a late snack.\nAs for snacks, my house is full of nuts and seeds for fats. I can now have milk, left over sweet potato or left over smoothy, more fruit, dark chocolate and the likes for carbs.proteins easy because of shakes and Tuna,  left over meats. My wife's a great cook and enjoys making me snacks that fit my macros like brownies using dates and nuts.\nSo far I've stayed away from pasta and bread, but I know if it fits my macros it'll be fine with it.\nRye bread is also a good thing for breakfast with banana and peanut butter.\nI track it all on MFP now.\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "After nearly 4 years of working out and I'm finally showing progress that I'm proud of.

I was failing out of college, just got dumped by my long term girlfriend, was rapidly losing friends (due to my bad attitude about things) and knew I needed to make a change. \n\nFast forward to around this time last year where I started reading through many of your all's posts and posting some questions of my own, I learned all about the wonders of actually creating and sticking to a diet and how to treat my body the correct way to achieve the goals I sought after. I was still at about 310 at this point, but what better time to start trying to achieve your goals than at New Years, right? \n\nI set my goals and really pushed to keep them! On New Year's morning, I weighed 297.5 pounds. This morning I woke up and weighed myself at 221.7 pounds! I'm still not to the fitness level that I WANT to finish at, but I am lifting regularly, eating healthily, running way more than I ever thought I would (and enjoying it \ud83d\ude05) , have a steady girlfriend, graduated from my university with a degree in physics, gained many great friends, AND in a few months I am going to join the United States Navy as a pilot*! I am living a much happier life now, and I feel like a completely new person! New year, new me actually worked haha! \n\nThank you guys so much for all of your posts and your constant motivation.

[Skinny](http://imgur.com/WqDvrvj) At 125 pounds I endeavoured on my eternal bulk, and after almost 5 years of training (much/most of it done ineffectively) I finally got up to 185 pounds at the age of 22.\n\n[BEFORE-Nov 2015](http://imgur.com/a/dnDtM)\n\n\nI became so focused and intrigued by watching the weight on the scale rise, that I became disillusioned and didn't realize how much of the weight was actually fat. So finally at the end of October 2015 I realized I needed to cut back down, which to me felt like I was taking a step backwards, albeit a necessary step.\nI came across leangains and loved all the things people had to say about it, as well as the results people got. I also was never hungry in mornings to begin with so I thought this method would work great for me.\n\nSome stats:\n* age- 23\n* height- 5'10\"\n* weight- 180--> 150\nI followed the traditional leangains protocol. High protein all days, low fat high carb on workout days, higher fat low carb on rest days. More calories on workout days. I followed a 3 day split focusing on rpt with the big lifts. If anyone is interested in more I'll explain in the comments.\n\n\n[AFTER-May 2016](http://imgur.com/a/f6xtw)\n\nI'm fairly pleased with my progress. Although now I feel small lol. I'm looking forward to bulking now, but with less fat gain.\nAlso, my after pics were about 45min-1 hour after a workout so I had a bit of a pump still. I figure everyone may appreciate some realism so I'll throw in pictures of me from 30 min ago after not having worked out, and having just finished eating.\n[flatter/bit bloated pics](http://imgur.com/a/EkDwH)\n\n\nThere it is, if you have any questions I'll answer down below.

I go more in detail about my diet and other stuff in the comments there.\n\n=========================================\n\nEdit: I'm 27.\n\n[Pictures](http://i.imgur.com/HhqqIBo.jpg). The first one is toward the end of September, 2013, and the second one was April 16th, 2016. I weigh 180 lbs. in both at 6'1.\n\nDisclaimers: I (now, and for most of the 2.5 year time frame) use mostly weights for legs.\n\nI use some weights for upper body as well. I started doing calisthenics because I lacked equipment (although I ended up enjoying it as well). I have a pretty unpredictable life, and in those 2.5 years equipment availability has come and gone more times than I can count. Unfortunately, for long periods of time I had either no access to gym equipment at all, or just enough that I decided to do legs with weights and calisthenics for my upper body. If I had to guess, I've probably done about 75% calisthenics and 25% weight training... again, for upper body.\n\nNow that that's out of the way... Training:\n\nI started doing strength based calisthenics around the time of the first picture. I had very little money, so I bought a door frame pull up bar for cheap, and used chairs to do dips. This is still most of the equipment I have for my bodyweight routine. I eventually bought a pair of high push up handles to increase my ROM on handstand push ups, but that's it. I think I spent maybe $20 on fitness for the first 2 years.\n\nMy first routine was something like the recommended routine here, but a bit split up. I did push ups, dips, L-sits and handstand practice on one day, pistol squats, pull ups, bodyweight rows and eventually front lever training the next. I just alternated days and did this about 6 months.\n\nAfter 6 months I started having on again-off again gym access. Since exact exercises varied so much based on what equipment I had, I have to be general here. I changed my \"split\" up from what I had been doing to PPL, and did this for about 6 months.\nOne day it dawned on me that I could do push and pull on the same day. Since there is little carryover between many push and pull exercises, I tried supersetting them. I made a PPL - upper/lower hybrid with the volume of PPL and the frequency of a full body split, and have been doing that ever since.\n\nOn an upper body day where I only use bodyweight, I will typically do these movements:\n\nPlanche training\n\nFL training\n\nPush up progression\n\nPull up progression\n\nHandstand push up progression\n\nBodyweight row progression\n\nDip progression.\n\nOn days where I have access/decide to use weights, my routine will look something like:\n\nDL\n\nBench\n\nOHP\n\nPull ups\n\nDips\n\nBodyweight rows\n\nIncline bench\n\nRows on incline\n\nmiscellaneous isolation for arms and shoulders.\n\nRegardless of whether or not I use weights, work outs are usually between 20-25 sets for each group (20-25 each of push and pull on upper days, 20-25 sets of legs on lower day). [Edit: this seems to be confusing some people. I do 20-25 sets per workout, normally 3-6 sets of a given exercise. For my upper body day I do 20-25 sets of different push exercises supersetted with 20-25 sets of different pull exercises.]\n\nDiet: I do cut/bulk cycles. I prefer to eat around 1g/lb of bodyweight of protein, about the same number of calories from fat, and the rest of my calories from carbs, per day. If my weight stalls for more than 2 weeks I adjust my calories (usually carbs) accordingly. I am a fan of relatively steep cutting, and slow bulking.\n\nBetween the pictures: After the first pic, I cut, because I did not want to get fat. I got down to almost 160, and had abs, but was just tiny and looked borderline emaciated. But the plan was to bulk up eventually, which I did for about a year and a half, going from 160-200 lbs. I started cutting again in early February this year, and took the second picture yesterday when I noticed I had reached my original weight again, and wanted to compare.\n\nI injured myself being an idiot while deadlifting in summer of 2014, and it has just gotten better the last few months. This kept me from doing a handful of exercises which aggravated my injury.\n\nThe future:\n\nI finally have stable gym access (home gym), and have for a few months. I still do just as much or more calisthenics than weight training for upper body, because I just love it. I plan on cutting down a bit more and then doing another long, slow bulk.\n\nFor legs here is my current routine in case any of you are interested:\n\nHigh bar back squats\n\nDeadlifts\n\nFront squats\n\nBarbell hack squats\n\nRomanian DLs\n\nStraight leg DLs\n\nFloor Glute Ham raises (gotta do a bit of bodyweight, right?)\n\nCalf raises (though these don't count towards the 20-25 sets!)\n\nThanks for reading!", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "~2.5 years of mostly calisthenics (upper) bodybuilding.

I started hitting the weights, not following any program, or tracking my progress at all. My 1 rep max on the bench was 95 pounds when I first began my journey. Same number for squat, and I didn't even know what a dead lift was at the time.\n\nI rose back to around 150ish with this \"program\" where I would basically just use whatever machine in the gym I felt like using at the time, and an absolutely trash diet. I wasn't getting much stronger, and I wasn't looking any stronger either. I actually ended up relapsing and going on a bender, dropping back down to 140ish pounds and ultimately ending up in the hospital. \n\nIt was after I got out of the hospital that I decided that I was going to be serious about getting in shape. I think that was the last push I needed to snap out of my jaded mental state.\n\nI started slowly cleaning up my diet. Every week I would take something out of the equation and replace it with a healthier alternative. I started doing more research on what I should be doing in the weight room, and what would actually push me outside of my comfort zone and make me stronger. \n\nAnd I began to see results. [160 pounds](http://media.tumblr.com/bf89cc7573afdb4d9e592a184996f44b/tumblr_inline_mxtmgzHArA1ryaoi6.jpg) After I started seeing noticeable differences, it only motivated me more. I was getting stronger, and honestly, it was pretty exciting. Somewhere in the process, it stopped becoming a chore, and I started to \"embrace the grind\". After every workout it seemed like the only thing I could think about was adding more weight to the bar next time. \n\nEventually I hit [170 pounds](http://38.media.tumblr.com/f4b84bc59dd397808e626d8e3d3372ef/tumblr_mvtnw45YVk1rj6d93o1_500.jpg), which was my original goal weight.

Thoughts of relapsing went away, I was no longer fueling my body with trash. It's hard to explain, but I guess I just felt much healthier. \n\nI walk around at around [192 pounds](http://38.media.tumblr.com/195a778a1df3477fbbc5938ce6023f1c/tumblr_n6agrkm93k1rj6d93o1_1280.jpg) nowadays. I feel stronger than ever, healthier than ever, and even my life outside the gym seems to be falling into place. A few more pics at my current weight\n\n[192](http://31.media.tumblr.com/90799e93414b170fbcd1f5a8bdb3832a/tumblr_n6agrkm93k1rj6d93o2_1280.jpg)\n[192](http://31.media.tumblr.com/1a3fb5adacc2a57864540bc0dc6dcdf7/tumblr_n6agrkm93k1rj6d93o3_1280.jpg)\n\nAs dumb as it may sound, the weight room has changed my life, my outlook, almost everything. At the risk of looking like an idiot, I felt it was important to share my story. It keeps me motivated and maybe, just maybe it would help someone out or motivate them as well.\n\n\nBecause people have asked, I'm currently running a PPL split and trying to cut down body fat. I stick to  compound lifts with all accessory exercises being done to drop sets. I still haven't followed any specific programs such as 5x5 or 5/3/1, but I am definitely going to consider it once I slim down a bit \n\n\nCheers guys and gals.\n\nEDIT:\n\nYou guys are awesome, thanks for the positivity and encouragement, it's really appreciated :]\n\nEDIT 2: \n\nHonestly I didn't think that I would get the kind of positive feedback that I'm getting right now. I'll keep this with me through my ventures to remind me how supportive people can be.

I will try to go into some more detail. If you have any specific questions, please feel free to ask!\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**DIET**\n\nSo as I mentioned, I was on almost a year long cut after being a chubby guy for the latter half of my college years. I went from 215 to 175 over the course of 7-8 months by eating around 1900-2200 calories per day, lifting 5x/week. I stalled around 175 but I was happy with being thin & didn't want to eat more. \n\nNeedless to say, I was miserable. Tired all of the time, unmotivated in the gym, my lifting numbers were pathetic, especially given how long I'd been lifting. I was just so afraid of getting chubby again that I never wanted to bulk. Thanksgiving of 2014, I had the most glorious, shameful cheat day of all time. A total binge, it was magnificent. It was that moment that I decided, well it's now or never.\n\nThe next day, I started eating 3000 calories per day. What I found was that even with 3000 calories, I was still maintaining my body weight. Every couple weeks, I'd bump up my intake by a hundred calories or so, and continue to monitor it. It wasn't until about 3600 daily calories that I began to gain weight, but even still - very slowly. I also cut back to 4x/week because 5 was just getting to be too much. I'm currently at about 3800-4000 per day.\n\nI'm a subscriber of \"IIFYM\" to a certain degree. My diet isn't great by any means but it's just so hard to eat 4000 calories of \"healthy\" food. So I definitely toss a bit of junk in there (pop tarts, chips, cookies, etc.) because those things are cheap, non-filling, and very calorie dense.\n\nThe only real target I follow is (1) Calories and (2) Protein. I aim for 1g of protein per lb of bodyweight. So about 190g for me. If I end up with 170g, I don't sweat it. As far as the carb/fat split - My phone app has fat at a little over 100g and carbs at a bit over 500g. But all honesty, the split of these too is FAR less important than overall calories & getting enough protein. So once I hit protein, I don't worry much about carbs or fat as long as my calorie goal is met.\n\nI'm a big craft beer fan, so all throughout this bulk, I've enjoyed probably a beer a night on average, and had plenty of weekends with multiple beers. During the week, I would count the beer calories just as I would any others. They don't have nutrition labels, so you can't be exact, but a decent estimate is 30 x ABV% for a 12 oz size. Beers like stouts and barleywines are more sugar dense, so you can multiply by x1.1 or x1.2 for these types of beers. But some beers are also less, so over time I think it all evens out. I usually estimate carbs as 10% of the calorie content. No doubt the beer may have slowed progress, I guess I'd never know since I've always drank it - but it hasn't halted my progress ever, and I still drink in moderation, plus I ACCOUNT for it.\n\nOn average, I have one cheat day per week. I know, cheat day during a bulk sounds ridiculous, but I mean, it would just be a day where I would free myself of having to count calories. But since my goal was BULK, I would make sure to eat a LOT of food on those days. I'm sure I went over 4000 many times, but also probably came under quite a few times, too. But If you're hitting your target 6 out of 7 days of the week, you'll be fine.\n\nObviously this many calories won't be perfect for every one. I think I just have a big metabolism. I work out 4x/week for about 1.5 hours. I have an office job & do not do any physical activity outside of the gym days. No cardio, ever. But what works for you WILL BE different, so start with a goal - be CONSISTENT - and monitor/adjust over time.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**ROUTINE**\n\nFrom January until about April, I did an accelerated version of 5/3/1. From April until now, I follower regular 5/3/1. Basically for the accelerated version, all I did was calculate my original Working Maxes for the program (you can find a pdf of 5/3/1 on google easily) and instead of progressing the way the manual said, I would add 10 lbs to every single upper body set during the next cycle, and 15 lbs for lower body sets.\n\nSo basically I calculated what I would do for three weeks: the 3x5 week, the 3x3 week, and the 5/3/1 week. No deloads during this time. Then, for the next three week cycle, each working set was +10 or +15 lbs. This got me to a point where I could no longer linearly(?) progress pretty quickly, so at that point, I swapped into the full 5/3/1. \n\nI won't describe 5/3/1 in details (like I said, you can find it online), but I will take you through the basic outline of what I did:\n\n**First:** Start every day with your \"BIG\" lift of the day. This was either Bench, Squat, OHP, or Deadlift. Follow your regular protocol for that week, whether it be 3x5, 3x3, or 5/3/1. This is the \"main\" set. I would also do 3 warm up sets of ~50% weight.\n\n**Second:** After the main lift was complete, I would always do \"Joker\" sets. This is described in the pdf called \"Beyond 5/3/1\" (also easy to find). Basically if you are able to complete your last set of the main set, you bump up the weight by 5-10% and do however many reps your target is that week. If you are able to do that, repeat until you can't any more.\n\nAt this point, I'm very close to my potential, so many Joker Sets just end up being heavy progressing sets of 2 reps or 1 rep regardless of the week. Either way, if you're doing a couple sets of REALLY heavy shit after your main set, you'll be okay. It's just a good wait to constantly push your limits. Lots of PR's will happen this way.\n\n**Third:** After joker sets, which may last for 1 set or 4 sets, I would do a group of lighter sets. I changed the weight constantly - You will just have to get a feel for how much weight is right for you. But I would always aim for anywhere from 3 to 5 sets of 5 to 10 reps. Again, it depends on the weight and HOW YOU FEEL. I would always judge this \"on the go\".\n\nFor example, if I had a killer dead lift set of jokers, maybe my back was torn up, so I'd do a much lighter weight than usual, and pull of five sets of 10 reps making sure to focus on form. Some days, I'll have a much heavier weight, but just do 3 sets of 6 reps if that's all I'm able to do. Just do SOMETHING. Some extra sets. Use that energy up.\n\n**Accessory Stuff:** I switched accessory lifts every day, but I followed one rule: NO MORE THAN 5 accessory lifts per day. Feel free to do less if you truly feel fully taxed and tired, nothing wrong with that. This made sure I wasn't overworking or overthinking things, plus it curbed my gym time to 1.5 hours or less. Don't over-think these, either. Just do five lifts that complement whatever muscle group you're working on. 3 sets of 8, 5 sets of 10, whatever. Just lift and get big. DO NOT OVER COMPLICATE ACCESSORY LIFTS!\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**EXAMPLE FOR EACH DAY WITH TYPICAL LIFTS I'D ROTATE IN & OUT** ...*Edit: to clarify, I don't do every single thing listed below every day. I do 5 accessories MAX - sometimes only 3 or 4 if I'm extra sore, tired, or in a time-crunch. The listed exercises are just some examples of things I'll rotate week-to-week for a given slot. E.g., on chest day, I like to hit my upper chest with either barbell include or dumbbell incline as listed below. But I don't do both. Then Lower chest, either BB decline, DB decline, or low angle flyes, etc.*\n\n.\n\n>**Chest Day**\n\n>* **BIG LIFT:** *Bench Press* - main lift, Joker sets, light sets\n\n>* **Upper chest:** *BB Incline, DB Incline*\n\n>* **Lower chest:** *BB Decline, DB Decline, Low angle flyes*\n\n>* **Outer chest:** *Cable flyes, lying DB flyes, Pec Deck*\n\n>* **Triceps:** *cable pull downs, close grip bench, skull crushers*\n\n>* **Dips:** *always do dips. weighted if you can*\n\n.\n\n>**Leg Day**\n\n>* **BIG LIFT:** *Squat* - main lift, Joker sets, light sets\n\n>* **Hamstrings 1:** *Ham curl machine, SLDL, good mornings, weighted lunges*\n\n>* **Quads:** *Leg press, front squats*\n\n>* **Hamstrings 2:** *something else from the list above*\n\n>* **Biceps 1:** *hammer curls, preacher curls, twenty-ones, etc.*\n\n>* **Biceps 2 / Wildcard:** *another type of curl, or abs, or even legs if you want*\n\n>*I did curls on leg day because I felt my legs got more than enough work-out with the first four lifts, so I had extra space to do curls on leg day and free up back day for more back focus*\n\n.\n\n>**Shoulder Day**\n\n>* **BIG LIFT:** *OHP* - main lift, Joker sets, light sets\n\n>* **Rear delt:** *Cable pull backs, DB rear flyes, face pulls*\n\n>* **Front delt:** *DB Overhead press, Arnold press*\n\n>* **Side Delt:** *Straight arm DB raises, cable raises*\n\n>* **Wildcard:** *Upright row, school buses, any other shoulder lift you want*\n\n>* **OHP Burnout:** *I would always finish with a seated OHP burn-out set with a lighter weight. Just made my shoulders feel good.*\n\n>*I used to do shrugs, but stopped eventually because Dead Lifts were getting so heavy that they worked my traps out more than enough. Plus, I would often do Upright row & Face pulls which helped a bit, too.*\n\n.\n\n>**Back Day**\n\n>* **BIG LIFT:** *Dead Lift* - main lift, Joker sets, light sets\n\n>* **Combined back:** *T-Bar rows, Cable rows, any type of row basically lol*\n\n>* **Lat 1:** *Pull ups, Straight arm pull down with a bar or a rope, Lat pull down (change grips from close or wide)*\n\n>* **Lat 2:** *Something else from the list above*\n\n>* **Separated back:** *Dumbbell row, one-arm cable row, something to work each side of your back independently*\n\n>* **Barbell Row:** *Yates style, Pendlay style, traditional BB Row style*\n\n>*Don't be shy in switching your grip style, grip handles, grip width, pull angle, etc., of any of these row types.*\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSo hopefully there's a good amount of stuff to digest. At my work, I have a graph of my progress which tracks actual max over time. I can post those tomorrow if anyone cares. Otherwise - if you have any questions I'd be more than happy to ask! Sorry for no video :( But I've never been the type to video myself in the gym. I have two people who can vouch for me though :)\n\n**Edit:** Those asking for video of the lifts... Sadly I have none, and I'm not the type of guy who normally videos myself in the gym with tons of people around. I just feel like a douche lol.

My biggest ever recorded weight was 400 or more (wow). That was in February of 2016 when I recorded that to MyFitnessPal.  I didn't actually start taking progress pics until about a week into juicing and my weight was about 380 or 385.  I weighed myself last night after chest workout and was officially 319.5 on the gym scale.\n\nDiet:\nMy wife and I started in October of last year. We bought a new juicer since our old one was shit. We increased our weekly food budget to about $140 and juiced until the end of November. The longest juice only stretch (without cheating at all) was 17 days straight. I was down about 35 lbs or so.\nAfter that I started doing more research and we decided to become vegetarian. I also started looking into Intermittent fasting. I did that for a couple weeks while still researching;  so much information. I started counting calories and began to only eat one meal a day. I love eating and I've found that eating one meal a day is amazing for me. When I eat I like to feel full. I limit my calories M-F to 1500. On Saturday and Sunday I eat 2000 to mix it up. Sunday I allow two meals.  The food has been outstanding. My wife is a great cook and even though we aren't eating meat, it has been awesome. (Side note: I believe animals are here for us to eat. I'm doing it for health reasons)\nI track everything on MyFitnessPal and eat 1500 calories in one sitting. I eat within one hour a day. I take fish oil, multi vitamins and B12 when I eat.\n\nExercise:\nAt first I did a lot of cardio. I used to be in excellent shape when I was 18-19. I weight lifted all the time. I know how, I was just embarrassed to do it since I was so much bigger and now weaker. I mainly did cardio and light lifting October to November. Now, all I do is weight lift. I'll walk for about 10-15 minutes a day, but that's it. I don't mix cardio and weight lifting in the same session. I'm lifting heavy for gains, and also because I've read that it burns more calories to push your body in weight lifting.\nQuick breakdown of my routine\nMonday: Shoulders\nTuesday: Legs\nWednesday: Biceps and Triceps\nThursday: Deadlift and Back\nFriday: Chest and Light Abs\n\n\nWrap it up:\nSo everything has been working pretty good so far. I had some slip ups at first but now I don't cheat ever. I lose anywhere from 3-5 lbs a week lately. \n\nAny tips are appreciated. My ultimate goal is to be about 210 with lots of muscle.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the feedback it really means a lot!

I design for a living and lived a sedentary lifestyle up until about 6 months ago. I smoked, never played sports, overweight for the most part of my life, had severe sleep apnea, and was a former meth addict (college years. The habit forced me to drop out of an engineering degree on my 3rd year.) \n\nA couple of years ago I was diagnosed with severe anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I was taking a progressive dose of anti-depressants. The meds were supposed to make me feel somehow confident and uplifted- and was supposed to help me cope with my OCD as well. It made me feel OK at first but later on it made me feel empty and suicidal. After a while of taking it, I found myself no longer enjoying that things that I used to enjoy- like making art, designing merchandise, and cooking. I suspect these activities are somehow tied to my OCD.\n\nI spoke to my family doctor about it and she suggested that perhaps I should try natural means of defeating my mental illness such as exposure therapy and exercise. Due to my plantar fasciitis and joints, back, and knees problem- the only exercise that she would allow me to do was swimming. Thanks to my social anxiety- I abhor swimming. \n\nJuly 2015. My 15 yr old girl and 6 yr old boy joined a Muay Thai gym in our area. Driving them and picking them up from the gym became my exposure therapy of sorts. I like the vibe but was very hesitant because I always had the mindset that I was not made for sports. At the urging of my wife and kids (we live in a tiny apartment and, thanks to my severe apnea, they can't stand my snoring anymore) I decided to join them. My doctor was against it but I was born a rebel so I persevered and I found that I thoroughly enjoyed the sport.\n\nI have since lost more than 20 lbs and I continue to burn anywhere between 1-3 lbs per week. My relationship with my wife and family is now waaaay better and I no longer need my prescription. Being physically fit changed my life.\n\n[Here's my Before and After photo. 5 months difference.](http://i.imgur.com/Zlupy3p.jpg) Sorry I have to watermark it, I don't want to fall prey to those with mercenary motives who steal photos like this and use it for their own profit. \n\n[This is me hitting the heavy bag with my wife.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BDHr0IaQu5C)\n\n[Me shadowboxing.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BDMZoJzQuw4)\n\nTL;DR An overweight, depressed, traumatized, and sick 35 year old father of four who never played sports his whole life tried Muay Thai and almost 6 months later became awesome. :-D\n\nEdit: I violated Rule 4: Progress/Achievement posts require relevant information.

From December onwards- I pretty much eat anything that I cook and serve my kids but in moderation (I have a Filipino background and we consume a lot of rice. I used to eat more than 2 cups per meal but now I'm down to 1). I have my cheat days on Fridays and have pizza and soda. On Saturdays I workout even if I don't really have to so I can eat my Tim Horton's chocolate dip donut. I drink a medium sized 1 cream 1 sugar coffee in the morning and sometimes at night as well. I smoke marijuana 10 minutes before workout and throughout the day actually. I still smoke the occasional cigarette but I can now go for days without it. I have four kids and a business to run so I sleep anywhere between 3-6 hours only every night.\n\n*********Exercise routine:*********\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: Muay Thai conditioning and some bag/pad work\nSaturday: Light warm up and some bag work\n\nWhat is Muay Thai conditioning? It varies but basically it's about 45minutes - 1hour of nonstop workout followed by about half an hour of hitting the pads or the heavy bag. Here's a sample workout: \n\nWarm up routine:\n*3-10 minutes skipping rope or 10-20 minutes run\n*3 sets of 40 jumping jacks, 40 front back front, 40 alternating knees, 40 right kick ups, 40 left kick ups, 15 jump squats\n\nHeavy bag routine:\n*4 sets of 25 right swing kicks, 25 left swing kicks, 25 right push kicks, 25 left push kicks, 50 speed jabs and cross punches. [Here's a video of me and my wife doing 50 swing kicks each each leg](https://youtu.be/R30EIHJZjTo). \n\n*********Here are some tips that help me get from point A to point B.*********\n\n* BE TRUE TO YOURSELF. I admitted to myself that I was sick and I needed help. And so I did admit and I did it publicly. I joined Movember on 2014 and [I blogged about my struggle on my own business website](http://www.fraternalties.com/blogs/news/15850180-demons-depression-and-mustache). Some people thought that it would be the end of my business career for coming out like that but instead my business received more interest. Nobody joined me on my Movember campaign though.\n\n* USE SOCIAL MEDIA. Let your intent be known. I always wanted to be fit but the attachment to my bad habits was strong. When I was trying to quit smoking, I read somewhere that it would be helpful if you let your family and friends know that you're quitting. There's a psychology behind this but that's beyond my area of expertise. So on November 2015 I participated in Movember once more and told my followers in Facebook about it. I also made a cringe-worthy [Movember day 1 video](https://youtu.be/LTpj8xtMTLs). I only managed to get 1 MoBro supporter- my personal trainer but that was enough to motivate me.\n\n* ADD SOME GIMMICK. The more dramatic the better. It's fun for you (and your audience and those around you will react positively!). Example: [I ate nothing but sardines with rice and olives](https://www.instagram.com/p/998s1EQu2Q) for breakfast, lunch, and dinner everyday for the entire month of November. [I skipped rope with PVC rope wearing my suit and tie](https://youtu.be/KqGzMqaOPtM). There are other crazy stuff that I did but the idea is to push yourself and enjoy doing it.\n\n* INVOLVE YOUR LOVED ONES. Be an inspiration to each other. Actually, in my case, my wife and kids involved me. My kids are so into Muay Thai that my 6y/o asked me to make him a [Youtube channel dedicated to Muay Thai](https://youtu.be/B-P-2wQY8gE). My 15 y/o girl can't wait to fight in the ring, and even our [2 y/o twins are active in the gym](https://youtu.be/Y9_h6zBAeZ0). \n\n\nEdit 2: 50 kicks each leg for a total of 100 kicks per person. \nEdit 3: Trying to fix formatting to make it more readable.

It covers a lot about strength training and is a *very long read* (much like this post itself!) \n\nSince most of the users in this subreddit are novice to intermediate lifters I figured I'd just copy/paste the most relevant section: \n\n\n**GZCLP**\n(GZCL Linear Progression for new lifters)\n\n[This infographic will improve understanding of terms and concepts in regards to the following paragraphs.](http://i.imgur.com/I5F2X7n.png)\n\nNovice lifters and coaches are familiar with traditional, popular models of linear progression programs. Starting Strength, Greyskull, etc. are all the top performers in this class of programming for a person new to strength training. As an option, these lifters can use GZCLP to transfer into a progression scheme with a GZCL format that eventually morphs into their own personalized GZCL program.\n\nGZCLP utilizes the below T1 progression scheme:\n\n*Weight x Reps x Sets*\n\nTake the last weight from previous LP program (or start new with GZCLP!) and perform these workouts:\n\n**Workout A**\nT1: Squat x Bar (or Last LP Weight) x 3 x 5+\nT2: Bench x Bar (or Last LP Weight) x 10 x 3\nT3: Lat Pull Down x Z-Weight x 15 x 3+\n\n**Workout B**\nT1: OHP x Bar (or Last LP Weight) x 3 x 5+\nT2: Deadlift x Bar (or Last LP Weight) x 10 x 3\nT3: DB Row x Z-Weight x 15 x 3+\n\n**Progression Guidance** \n\nWhen workouts A & B are repeated the T1 and T2 flip flop, meaning Workout A the second time around would have T1: Bench and T2: Squat. Each workout alternates between a T1 squat or deadlift and a T1 bench press or OHP. Squat and deadlift T1 should not follow each other, likewise for bench and OHP. It is suggested that a day off minimum be taken between workouts, which makes this a 3x per week schedule, like most LP programs out there.\n\nThis does have the negative aspect of slower progression (at least when reading, but in practice definitely not) than something like Starting Strength where all movements are performed each movement and weight is added each workout. A second negative aspect is the lower lift frequency since the lifter is not performing the squat, bench, and deadlift each workout. However, the benefit of GZCLP over other linear progression programs is the added volume per workout for each lift through AMRAP sets on the T1 lifts for the day, as well as the 10 rep sets when that movement becomes a T2 a few days later. The effort required to continuously push the T1 and T3 progressions via AMRAPS is what sets GZCLP apart from other linear progressions; for this reason lifters should push their AMRAPS every workout to 1-2 reps until failure. (As always recommended with AMRAPS and MRS.)\n\nMany common LP programs follow an extremely low volume approach with moderate frequency. This is disagreeable because new lifters need practice, and that requires reps. It is important to understand that when coming from no base of fitness or strength training history this higher volume and effort may require a significant deload of bar weight (\u201cintensity\u201d for those new to strength training) and it is recommended that recovery means be of the highest importance when making a transition to lifting, in particular when choosing to use GZCLP as your ticket aboard the Gains Train.\n\nWhen needing more recovery while on GZCLP more reps can be left in the tank, thus lowering the overall effort of that workout. This then reduces training stress and lessens the recovery debt of that workout.\n\n**GZCLP T1 Progression**\n\nStart with three reps for five sets, last set AMRAP (3x5+) adding weight workout to workout and when base volume of 15 is missed (because the lifter did not think they could do 1-2 more, not because of actual failure) then the lifter would use that same weight they missed at and continue progression by dropping to 2 reps per set, for 6 sets, last set AMRAP (2x6+). This would then start progression again, adding weight workout to workout until they failure to achieve base volume of 12. Once failure with 2x6+ occurs then the reps would drop a third step to one rep per set for 10 sets, last set AMRAP. (1x10+) Continue to add weight workout to workout with the ten singles. When failure to reach base volume of 10 occurs rest for 2-3 days and test for a 5RM.  Use 85% of this new 5RM to start the next cycle of 3x5+ and progress in similar fashion to the previous cycle. Each successive repeat through 3x5+ will be shorter due to the lifter now being stronger.\n\nIt is recommended that no more than 5/2.5 to 10/4.5 (LB/KG) be added workout to workout for novices and early intermediates. Do not push AMRAP sets beyond 10 reps even if there\u2019s enough gas in the tank to do so.\n\nDo not add weight set to set for any of the workouts. These are to be done at a fixed weight across all sets. Weight is only added when repeating the workout with that movement as a T1.\n\n**GZCLP T2 Progression**\n\nProgress ten reps for three sets (10x3) adding weight workout to workout until the failure to reach base volume of 30 reps. When failure to reach base volume of 30 reps occurs drop to eight reps for three sets (8x3) and continue to add weight, this too will eventually end with failure to reach base volume of 24. Once 8x3 ceases to improve drop to six reps for three sets (6x3). Once failure to reach base volume of 18 restart the process for two to three cycles more, each cycle resetting at 10x3, but at a slightly heavier weight than previously used- no more than 20/9. (LB/KG)\n\nContinue attempting to progress a core T1 lift (Squat, Bench, Deadlift, or OHP) in the T2 until comfortable moving into a more traditional GZCL method structure using an optional variety in the T2; incline from OHP as an example. This will help introduce variety, a staple of the GZCL Method, to newer lifters.\n\n**GZCLP T3 Progression**\n\nProgress by using the last set AMRAP. Once the weight can be lifted for 25 reps on that last set an in increase in weight should occur. A back isolation movement such as a row or lat pull down (or pull up if possible) should be used as the initial T3 movements for Workouts A &B. Be modest in this progression because T3 movements will have lower thresholds of weight increases. Eventually these T3 movements will build intensity and volume to match requirements needed for a potential T2b movement in a full scale GZCL program, if necessary or desired. (Since back isolations can be T2 movements as explained earlier.)\n\nOnce GZCLP recovery is stabilized and progression through two to three cycles is complete adding volume from the bottom up in order to more completely transfer to a truer GZCL approach is recommended. This approach is detailed below.\n\nTransferring to and Going from Novice to Intermediate on GZCL\nWhen first considering switching to a GZCL Method style of training understand that the workload is typically more than what\u2019s expected. This can be mitigated by accepting that going full steam into a new training program is likely to result in disaster and a better decision is to get the feet wet first. Start with a single movement per tier, per workout, and keep volume at base levels for each tier. (T1: 10/ T2: 20/ T3: 30) By doing so the initial stress of switching to a GZCL Method approach can be recoverable. From there it is suggested that as an individual\u2019s adaptation occurs the volume then increase from the T3 up.\n\nStart increasing the volume of the T3 by adding a second movement (T3b) for a single set of 8-10 reps. This can be done for just one day or multiple days. If that is manageable increase that T3b by one set again the next workout while also adding a few reps to the existing T2 movement. These additional T2 reps can be tacked onto existing sets or by adding a whole new set to that tier. By doing so the volume base increases from the bottom up, just as a pyramid should. Each time the new T3 movement is performed another set should be added until it has reached a base volume level of 30. Do not add more than three movements; stop adding reps when each movement has a base volume of 30.\n\nAfter three T3 movements with 30 total reps each has been added, without any recovery issues, push the T3a movement up to 50 reps total each workout it is performed. This will expose the novice and intermediate lifter to very high rep sets and could act as an initial exposure to different effort increasing training methods, rest-pause as an example. This approach will finalize effort and work capacity needed to make a sustainable switch to a second T2 movement if desired. \n\nOnce achieved the lifter is essentially running a personalized model of GZCL built around their means and abilities. From there they have a solid understanding of how to adjust training variables up or down to achieve training goals. These variables are most commonly recognized as intensity, volume, and effort.\n\n*Warning*: If increasing volume from top to bottom were to occur the lifter would likely see an immediate positive impact from the added T1 volume, but they would quickly be adding too many reps (assuming it was done semi-intelligently with rep addition via singles to the T1) to the most intense tier and their work capacity could not maintain efforts, and recovery debt would require bankruptcy. Similarly, adding volume to each tier simultaneously results in like performance decline, just on a longer timeline. Building from the bottom up builds muscular endurance and work capacity, each of which are needed to successfully and sustainably progress all tiers.

The glenohumeral joint can perform these movements: http://imgur.com/J2Qltrc. \n\nThe second joint involved in the shoulder is called the scapulothoracic joint. This is the articulation of the scapula and the ribs (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7h2FJnSXyw). This joint is capable of these movements: http://imgur.com/5T019q2. The scapulothoracic joint is what you move when you perform shrug or shrug your shoulders forward. \n\n\n**The rotator cuff**\n\n\nI won\u2019t dwell on the rotator cuff much, this topic has already been wrote about in numerous threads. Here is a thread where I wrote about this topic: http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3avaia/the_rotator_cuff_and_how_to_train_it/\n\n\n**Muscles of the scapula**\n\n\nAs above, the shoulder joint is made up of two joints. Both of these joints should work together for optimal function of the shoulder. When the humerus is elevated the scapula should follow with upward rotation and this allows the ball to sit nicely into the socket (http://imgur.com/ZPEmVtF). So, basically the shoulder joint has two moving parts which need to move together to function effectively. \n\nThis process of scapula upward rotation is controlled by three (it\u2019s two really but easier to think of as three) muscles as shown in this picture: http://imgur.com/tsURIq0. The problem is that these muscles are an extremely common area for muscular imbalances, the upper trapezius should actually only contribute 3% to this upward rotation, but, due to it being overworked through shrugs and deadlifts it starts to overpower the lower trapezius and serratus anterior. The result is poor scapula movement. A tell-tale sign of a weak serratus anterior is a winging scapula (http://imgur.com/IJrZpih). \n\nTo solve this problem and avoid injury we need to strengthen up the serratus anterior and lower traps. I'm not going to lie, this is really hard. The lower traps can be worked through the \u201cprone one arm trap raise (Y)\u201d, \"prone horizontal abduction (T)\" and the \u201cW\u201d exercises. Cressey and Reinold give a much better explanation than I can here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzRpo0mv328 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxqUpHXv3dQ and http://www.mikereinold.com/2011/04/the-shoulder-w-exercise.html. For the serratus anterior, here is a way of isolating it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMyVvsiBNx8. As I have said above, training these muscles is difficult as hell, most people simply don\u2019t have the concept of how to contract these muscles because they have never used them. If you can\u2019t feel any of these (and you will know when you get them right) then I seriously recommend seeing a PT and asking to work on these muscles even if you are not injured. This will keep your shoulders healthy for years to come (hopefully).\n\n\n**Row the boat**\n\n\nRow exercises are a fantastic deterrent to shoulder pathologies. For example, rhomboids work against the pecs (which are normally overactive) and can prevent the rounded shoulders posture that is so common. Most people do include the row in training programs with good intentions, but, normally with poor execution where the row becomes very lat focused and the rhomboids do nothing. I recommend coming away from the barbell row and working on this in a more controlled movement with good form. Here\u2019s a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4ooY1N05Ig. Always aim for a 2:1 pull:push ratio, this will help to prevent the rounded shoulder posture.\n\n\n **Stay out of the impingement zone**\n\n\nAs with the hip there is a certain position which particularly irritates the shoulder joint. This position is flexion and medial rotation, adduction is also commonly quoted (http://imgur.com/HDll9Mx). As a rule of thumb, any movement that raises your arm above 90 degrees should not be coupled with medial rotation where possible. Some small alterations can be made to exercises to make them more shoulder friendly. Here\u2019s a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5sNYB1Q6aM. It should be noted that when he says medial delt, it should be lateral delt. \n\n\n**I do know that I have not spoken about flexibility. I do believe this to be of utmost importance and I plan on making a separate thread about this.**\n\nEdit: added ratio\n\nEdit 2: Any more suggestions for future posts are welcome. \n\nEdit 3: spelling/grammar, added T exercise that I somehow forgot about. \n\nEdit 4: I just can't get my anatomical language right these days. anterior->lateral\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "A brief guide to preventing shoulder injuries", "post_ups": 1789, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3du0lc/a_brief_guide_to_preventing_shoulder_injuries/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:20.016256", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "vgisverbose", "post_created_utc": 1320248518.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1320252118.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "lxrvn", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 465, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1790, "post_selftext": "My birthday was yesterday.

In a year and a half, I've cleaved myself in two. \n\n* My waist is 26 inches smaller. \n* My hips are 25.5 inches smaller.\n* My chest is 19.25 inches smaller.\n\nI get asked often how I was able to do it. The answer is inception. Through communities like these, an idea got planted in my brain that wouldn't have been planted otherwise. The idea was that I could be great; that I could take control of myself and become not just a functioning human being but an athlete and become better than I'd ever been. I spent years in a dark room, lit only by my monitor. Blue sky hurt my eyes. But then through the same Internet that helped me destroy my life, I found the foundation to rebuild.\n\n* [SomethingAwful's Ultimate Transformation Thread](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3334499) is similar to [LoseIt's Hall of Fame](http://www.flickr.com/photos/loseit/sets/72157626414086985/show/http://www.flickr.com/photos/loseit/sets/72157626414086985/show/) and it hit me like a ton of bricks. I scrolled down seeing people changing everything about themselves. Picture after picture of people on the Internet who took control.\n\nAfter years of self loathing and depression, I saw a tiny dot of light. It's easy to let yourself die when you think you have nothing to live for -- no purpose or reason to exist. But that tiny dot of light became everything to me. \n\n* [I started a fitness log and meticulously tracked everything I did.](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3292685&userid=0&perpage=40&pagenumber=1) \n* I did tons of research.

[Ketogenic low carb](http://josepharcita.blogspot.com/2011/03/guide-to-ketosis.html) fit my needs the best.\n* I took my fitness seriously but also took it slow.\n\nI knew that I'd quit if I tried to push myself too hard, which was a conclusion that I made from a large sample size -- a life spent quitting everything. I started off doing simple body weight exercises and used some lame 20 lb dumb bells to do presses and flys.\n\nI dynamically assigned myself workout routines based on the adaptation of my body to its new size as I got smaller. As I became more fit, I pushed myself more. I eventually felt good enough to start lifting heavier weights. \n\n* I got a weight bench because I knew I was too ashamed to work out in front of people and if I tried to force myself to do it, I'd quit.\n* I studied different lifting programs and ended up using [sean10mm's Modified Starting Strength](http://goonlifter.wikispaces.com/sean10mm's+Modified+Starting+Strength) program.\n\nLast year around this time, I still weighed 424 pounds. I'd lost 114 pounds but I was still super morbidly obese. This is what I think back to when people now ask me how I kept going -- how I found the will power to keep pushing forward.\n\n* [This is what I looked like on my birthday last year.](http://foodisforfuel.com/wp-content/gallery/progress/424-11-03-10.jpg)\n\nThe reason I kept going is because when I looked in the mirror, I didn't see that face or body. I saw what I would be today, and today, I see what I'm going to be in 6 months. In 6 months, I'll see what I'm going to be in a year.\n\nI was able to lose so much weight because I never thought about how flawed I was. I only thought about how I could become who I wanted to be and when that was the only thought flooding my mind, my imperfections became irrelevant because ultimately, they were temporary.\n\nNow I'm using [Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 weight training system](http://www.amazon.com/Simplest-Effective-Training-Increase-Strength/dp/0557248299/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1320247531&sr=8-1), which is more advanced, but works well with my goals and my declining strength as I cut weight. I modified it to include more volume as I felt able to do more.\n\nYesterday, I did 59 deadlift reps. I did 125 curl reps. I did 53 push ups. I did 57 overhead barbell squats. I lift weights 4 days a week. I play basketball -- just shooting by myself -- for something like 5 hours a week. I didn't have a cake because I no longer arbitrarily attach food to celebrations or holidays. I discovered that food is for fuel and that real joy needs to come from life experiences. The joy of mobility trumps the ever-living-hell out of the joy of icing.\n\nI can do that now because I didn't kill myself in a gym or on a treadmill a year ago. I didn't tempt myself to quit so I could push through it and become a \"better person\" for it. I didn't get a personal trainer's raging spittle all over my grill. I paced myself and my fitness evolved with my body. You don't have to render yourself breathless to be able to truly appreciate the air you breathe. You just have to keep breathing.\n\n* [Here's a video of my fitness evolution.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBBU-Cuosfg&feature=channel_video_title) I did my first dips with good depth last week.\n\nSo happy birthday to me. Next year, I'm going to be even better. My life still isn't what I want it to be but I don't give a shit what it is now. I'm interested in what it can be tomorrow, or the next week, or the next month, or the next year. And next year, I'll be focusing on who I'll be the year after that.\n\nI'm half the man I used to be but I'm nowhere near the man I'm going to be.\n\nEdit: [http://nuclearfuzzgrunge.com/tlcm/](http://nuclearfuzzgrunge.com/tlcm/) -- This is a mirror for one of the SA threads that got me started and has a ridiculous amount of information about low carb dieting on it.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "I'm half the man I used to be but I'm nowhere near the man I'm going to be.

It is the resultant posture of tightness and weakness in certain muscle groups of the core and pelvis that causes your pelvis to tilt anteriorly and downward. This can be seen pretty easily from the side in somebody that has it. You will notice an exaggerated curvature in the lower back and possibly even a protruding stomach. The belly is not protruding because of it being overweight (although it might be) but rather because the muscles of the abs are not strong enough to counteract the downward pull of the pelvis.\n In this video you will be shown how to reverse the effects of chronic sitting by addressing what muscles are causing anterior pelvic tilt and how to strengthen the areas that are weak.

I've been struggling with depressive tendencies for as long as I can remember, and if there's something I've noticed about working out with weights it's that the whole exercise is, in fact, almost entirely mental. The body can always do a lot more than you think it can, and the trick to a really good workout is getting into the right mindset - the hardest thing about lifting with depression is that you're really lifting two things.\n\nSo to this end I've been getting into meditation recently - it comes highly recommended from just about any source on mental wellbeing you care to mention and sits next to antidepressants and CBT as one of the most effective treatments for depression currently known. The interesting thing, however, is that a meditative exercise is actually a lot like lifting. To demonstrate, I want to share with you all an exercise I recently did with a group here at the London Buddhist Centre called \"Mindfulness of Breathing\" - don't worry too much about the Buddhism or the buzzwords - just because something good happens to have come from a religion doesn't mean it's a religious practice (indeed, after all, did we not get Modern Science from the Muslims?).\n\nTry this exercise once a day - before you go to sleep, and you'll sleep better; instead of drinking or smoking and it will help you cut down drinking and smoking; more generally, it will train your mind, giving you greater control of your thoughts, the way training your muscles gives you greater control of your body. All of these factors (sleep, drugs, mindset), as you already know, contribute to making a fitness regime more effective.\n\n## Let's Begin ##\n\nFirst up you need to find a suitable place to do this - you want as little distraction as possible, quiet and dimly lit, with a chair or a soft floor/mattress against a wall. The position in which you do this is everything: sitting (NOT LYING) with your back straight and your butt flat on something - the best way to do it is in a chair with your feet flat on the floor, but I usually do this on my bed with my back against the wall and my legs loosely crossed with as little weight sitting on my feet as possible - with a small cushion in the small of your back (not essential but I find it makes it easier to keep my back straight) and under your butt if you so desire.\n\nThe easiest way to find out how you should be sitting is to slip your hands under your butt and find the two little bony bumps near the tops of your legs. These are your \"sit bones\" (*tuber ischiadicum*) and as you rock your upper body back and forth you'll feel them press more or less firmly into your hands. You want these to be as firmly in contact with your seat as possible, so wherever you feel them pressing hardest into your hands, that's how you should sit.\n\nNow take your hands out from under your butt and put them in your lap. It doesn't matter where they are as long as they're still and comfortable - I usually hold them close to my belly, palms up, one inside the other, but they can literally be any way you want them to be, fingers entwined, palms down, one hand on each leg, wherever feels most natural.\n\nFinally, close your eyes.\n\n## Warm Up ##\n\nFirst thing you're going to need to do is take two deep breaths. Breathe in as deep as you can, hold it, breathe out. Repeat. Simple, and vital. This is analogous to **stretching** before you work out - it eliminates the initial tension (**stiffness**) that will hold you back for the rest of the exercise if you don't do it.\n\nNow we're going to do a \"body scan\" - this is akin to **warming up** - again, you can skip it if you really want to, but it will make the rest of the exercise a lot easier - this process will simultaneously relax your body and bring your mind into the particular mode/state which makes meditation possible. A body scan goes like this:\n\n1. Focus on the sensation in your toes. What do you feel? Perhaps you can feel your socks, the hair on top of your toes, maybe a bit of tingling, the skin of your toes against each other. Focus on this and nothing else. Notice what you feel - don't try to put it into words, don't try to change how it feels, just try to notice.\n2. Focus on the tops and bottoms of your feet. Same thing - what do you feel? Maybe there's a subtle ache from walking around through the day, some heat. Be receptive. If your feet are flat on the floor pay especial attention to the horizontal surface-to-surface sensation - this is your connection back to the ground, your solidity, your base, and there is a lot of strength here for the mind.\n3. Heels and ankles, same thing.\n4. Calves - carry a lot of tension - just feel it, don't try to relax necessarily - the attention itself will do the relaxing for you - tension is a very unconscious thing.\n5. Shins - maybe you can feel the material of your clothing - if indeed you feel nothing, focus on the lack of sensation itself, the negativity, the absence. It's a curious feeling, isn't it? It's rather strange when you actually notice it.\n6. Knees - and don't forget the backs of your knees either.\n7. Thighs - front and back, and as you go up toward your butt you're likely to feel a lot of tension here too (women especially carry a lot of tension in the buttocks) - feel the buttocks flat on the horizontal surface - again, here is your connection back to the base - feel your body heavy on this solidity, almost like you're a part of it (which you are).\n8. Lower back, and from here up the spine - this is the hardest part of the scan - feel the muscles radiating out of your spine - feel the spine extending all the way from the seat up to the back of the head - it's long! It's really long, and a lot of your muscles connect directly to it - feel all the aches and strains in your back as your focus moves upward (as slowly as it needs to) and outward to your shoulders.\n9. Down the arms - from the shoulders through the triceps and biceps, the elbows, the forearms and wrists - try to feel each of these muscles individually (a mental ability which, by the by, comes in very handy in the middle of a lift - if you can feel where in your body the lift is actually happening you're more likely to know if you're doing it as you intend it, and to shift the weight accordingly) and the skin on them - linger as long as you need to to register some kind of sensation, whatever it is.\n10. The hands - like the feet these are complex systems and require some time on their own - the tops and palms of your hands first.\n11. The fingers - whatever your hands are touching, you'll feel it most in your fingers - there is a lot of sensation here, so take the time to feel each finger individually, the touch of the fingers against each other and against the surface on which they're rested.\n12. Your belly and chest - there tends to be a knot of tension somewhere in this area - linger on it and feel it ever so slowly loosening - feel your ribs as they move, little by little, inward and outward with your breath - feel your diaphragm expand and contract - feel the tension under your armpits which spreads all the way back to your spine.\n13. Your neck - like your hands and your feet, your head is a complex area with a lot of muscles and a lot of sensation - and, perhaps more importantly, a LOT of tension - so we're going to do each individual little bit separately - feeel the muscles in your neck radiating toward your chest, your shoulders, your upper back.\n14. The back of your head and your ears - move your focus slowly up in a band around the back of your head and to the crown - you should be able to feel all the hair on your head (or skin if you've got no hair) - it might help to imagine what it would feel like to be massaged in this area.\n15. Your forehead - lots of tension here - from the hairline down to the eyebrows.\n16. The orbits and cheeks - ditto - linger as you need to.\n17. The nose and lips - you'd be surprised how much tension there is in the top lip and the little bit between your lips and your nose - feel it, let yourself feel it all.\n18. The jaw - this is the most tense part of most people's bodies - the ideal for meditation is that the jaw should be just slack enough that your teeth aren't touching - this is harder than it sounds.\n\nEasy, right? Now do this twice more. Try to feel each of these parts of your body relax progressively as you repeat the process. It can help to imagine light moving up and over your body as you do this, especially if you imagine this light comes from your belly - a warm, golden orange light - starting as a little ball in your *solar plexus*/*sacrum* and expanding out into a ring, then moving down to wrap in around your toes, before proceeding upwards as above.\n\n## The Lifts ##\n\nTo recap, you've done 2 x deep breaths + 3 x body scans. You will now do four exercises, analogous for our purposes to **lifts** - and each will involve a number of **sets** of ten **reps** - literally. The aim of these exercises is to focus on your breath. You want to be intensely aware of the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body and the way your body reacts to the air as it comes in, moves about, and then exits - and then, most importantly, that very still period between the breaths when your body is empty. Ultimately you should feel your breath in your whole body - this is why we do the body scan first, so as to bring the sensation of your body to the fore in your mind.\n\nDuring this time you're going to notice thoughts coming into your consciousness. This is where \"meditation\" properly speaking happens - the aim is to bring your focus deliberately back to the breath. Make no mistake: you're not trying to suppress your thoughts - rather, what you're trying to do is recognise your thoughts *as* thoughts (instead of as facts or realities) - these are mental phenomena, and (so the story goes) you do, in fact, have the freedom (if you train yourself) to choose how you respond to their presence in your life.\n\nEvery thought process is a train, and your consciousness is a train station - when the train pulls up to the station, you decide whether or not to get on. Much of life's happiness involves getting caught up in a thought train (read up on **Flow Psychology** for more info) but for the purposes of meditation your aim is not to get onto any of these trains. This is harder than it sounds - much harder - that's why you train.\n\nFor the first two exercises (or **lifts**) we are going to count the **reps** - 1 to 10 - for one reason and one reason only: the moment you realise you've lost count or stopped counting, that's when you know your attention has deviated - bring your attention back to the breath and start again from 1. Don't be discouraged when this happens - on the contrary, take joy in these moments, for each of these is a little triumph - you'll notice it feels almost kind of uncomfortable to do this deliberate focussing of the attention - this discomfort is analogous to **the burn** - and indeed when meditation is difficult (like lifting, sometimes it's easy and sometimes it's hard) you will have to **dig** to bring the attention back to the breath.\n\nHow to breathe? Naturally. Don't try to breathe slowly, don't try to hold the breath, just let yourself breathe - indeed what you want to do is notice - the whole aim of meditation is to notice, to watch your body react, to watch with curiosity and receptivity - notice how the breath changes, how the state of the body changes as you breathe and as your breath changes - you might feel your heart beating, you might feel your body temperature dropping - let all of this sensation become as bright and intense as possible - and indeed it can get very intense, sometimes overwhelming - stick with it, try to focus on the positive feelings you have.\n\nFocus always on the breath: the life-giving breath. Imagine the air is fresh and imbuing your body with energy - because, of course, as you'll already know from your reading on fitness, this is in fact what is actually happening. Oxygen is entering your red blood cells, which produce *adenosine triphosphate* or ATP, whose responsibility it is to transfer the caloric value of whatever nutritional intake you've provided for yourself to the rest of your body - your muscles, your organs, your brain. Remember: there are people in this world who live on 500 calories a day or less - for example, Buddhist monks, whose entire caloric intake is determined by what they can beg - and live to old age in great health. It's the breath that you need before you need anything else: whatever life throws at you, if you can breathe with it, you can be with it. Meditation makes you a hardier person - this is why we do it.\n\n**Enough talk!**\n\nLet's do it:\n\n1. First you're going to focus your attention on the little infinitesimal moment at the end of the exhale - as soon as you notice the breath stop moving, say to yourself in your mind: \"1\" - repeat, and this time, as soon as you notice the air stop moving: \"2\" - and so on and so forth. You're going to do three **sets** of ten **reps** for the first few weeks of your meditation - as you continue and develop, the time it takes for the distraction to happen grows, and the number of sets increases.\n2. Same thing again, but this time you're going to focus on the moment the breath **starts** - the tiny infinitesimal moment just **before** you **inhale** - and as soon as you feel the air start to move, say to yourself in your mind: \"1\" - repeat, and this time, as soon as you notice the air start to move: \"2\" - and so on up to \"10\" before beginning again at \"1\" - repeat this three times.\n3. At this point you're going to stop counting - but always remember, as soon as you notice yourself getting on a thought train, get off, and get back to the breath. In this exercise you are going to focus on the breath as a whole. The breath is a process - it involves your whole body and it moves in a cycle from beginning to end - feel the breath move through you, feel your body respond to the breath.\n4. Finally, you are going to focus - again, without counting - on *just* the place where you *first* feel the breath. This might be at the end of your nose, where you feel the cool air entering your nostrils; it might be your belly, where you feel your diaphragm drop; it might be your rib cage, where you feel your lungs expanding. These sensations all happen simultaneously, so which one you feel first will change each time you do this meditation, but for each individual meditation pick a spot and stick to it. Do this for as long as you can bear it, always looking out for thought trains. This should be the longest part of the meditation.\n\nFinally, **cool down** - all you need to do is sit, and relinquish control of your thought. Just be still for a moment. Slowly let your eyes open. Notice the room around you. Notice where your thoughts want to go. Let them go. Slowly start moving. Stand up. Stretch. Go forth. Be prosperous.\n\nBest of luck all.\n\nEDIT:\n\nWow this thread exploded. OK so to clarify some things:\n\n1. I'm very much a beginner - please do not take anything I've said as an authoritative opinion.\n2. This is very much a beginner exercise - more importantly, there are probably as many ways to meditate as there are people - this is just one - I like it because it's neatly structured.\n3. The reason I've shared this is that even with my very limited exposure to meditation I can already see it working in my life and I wish I had started doing it two years ago - meditation classes are often offered for free with an optional donation - reading a description has nothing on actually doing it with someone who knows what they're doing - this is just a call to anyone who might consider it to go and do it! It works for me - it makes life bearable - if you don't have difficulty bearing life you probably don't need to meditate! :)\n4. Whether it's \"bullshit\" or not really comes down to whether it helps or not - fortunately for us all someone has compiled a handy list of psych studies regarding meditation: http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/feeling-it/201309/20-scientific-reasons-start-meditating-today\n5. YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO STOP YOUR THOUGHTS - this is one of the main reasons people quit meditation: they think they're trying to clear their head entirely and give up because it's too hard - in fact it is impossible - what you are trying to do is deliberately NOT TO ENGAGE with your thoughts, instead only noticing them, becoming aware of them, just like all the rest of the sensation you're trying to notice, to become aware of, in this exercise", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Meditation is actually a lot like lifting and can add a lot to a fitness regime - allow me to explain", "post_ups": 1774, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2ed0v2/meditation_is_actually_a_lot_like_lifting_and_can/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:20.016256", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "ekuL8", "post_created_utc": 1502816245.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "6tvg88", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 416, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1782, "post_selftext": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316337441_PHYSIOLOGICAL_PROFILE_OF_MONOZYGOUS_TWINS_WITH_35_YEARS_OF_DIFFERING_EXERCISE_HABITS\n\nThis was mentioned on a recent Joe Rogan Experience episode with Dr Andy Galpin.\n\nThe experienced runner was found to have increased VO2 max and lower body fat %, but similar overall lean body mass and _lower_ strength + muscle quality in the legs.\n\nWhile this follows the general understanding among trained individuals of some of the limits of endurance cardio type training I think it's really interesting that the decades of running doesn't just have limited effectiveness for strength and muscle building, but rather could be detrimental compared to complete inactivity. \n\nObviously the study is based on only 2 people, but given that they have the exact same DNA it's pretty compelling.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Study of monozygous twins - one with 35 years avid distance running and one untrained - interesting findings", "post_ups": 1782, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/6tvg88/study_of_monozygous_twins_one_with_35_years_avid/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:20.016256", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "kikite", "post_created_utc": 1458598550.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1458636025.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "4bel97", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 138, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1781, "post_selftext": "I have thought several times about posting my story, but as a more \u201celderly\u201d Reddit lurker who is pretty shy, I have always held back. But reading the story of 35 year old u/2balls1cane today (Congratulations dude on the transformation!), I decided to post, at least so that other folk of my age know that they can change themselves and that it really is not that hard. First of all, the before and after:\n\nBEFORE and AFTER; http://imgur.com/XaxPokG\n\nMy story starts about 2010. Like most guys hitting middle age, I had pretty much woken up overweight wondering what had happened. I have always had the tendency to be a little overweight all my life, maybe an extra 20 lbs, but by time I hit 40 I had hit about 170 lbs and decided that now my BMI was past 25 (I am 5\u2019 7\u201d) it was time to take some action, not to mention I was pretty much down to the last pair of pants I could button up! With the help of Loseit! and portion control, I got down to 145 lbs. I didn\u2019t put any major exercise into this plan other than a brisk walk every day or two.\n\nBut then, disaster! I put it all back on in a year. Why? Cause I made the error of thinking that once you hit a weight, you stay at a weight, while quickly returning to my old eating habits. I remember the moment very well \u2013 it was Christmas and someone brought out a box of Seers candies, and I thought what the hell! What this taught me was that dieting works, can even be interesting and challenging, but keeping the weight off is the real challenge, and one that seems less rewarding as you feel that you have already made your goal.\n\nCome 2012, I gave it another shot. I started as I did before, just cutting my calorie intake to a net of about 1500 calories a day. The Loseit! charts for my weight, calorie intake and exercise calories are here:\n\nCALORIE INTAKE, BODY WEIGHT and EXERCISE CALORIES: http://imgur.com/sFPZW0j\n\nI think I was pretty lucky that I underwent a smooth weight loss, losing about 1.5 to 2 lbs a week. Once I hit 145lb I started increasing my calorie budget towards about 2100 calories a day, but supplementing in more and more exercise. I\u2019ll be honest, I have never really been into exercise, but I incorporated more and more of it simply so I could eat more. The exercise was always cardio-based \u2013 mountain biking and running, normally 5Ks or the occasional 10K about 3 times a week. I can\u2019t say I loved it, especially at first, but I was encouraged by the fact that I could see it having positive effects not just on my weight but also my cardiovascular fitness and my muscle tone. Hell, I was starting to see my abs! After about a year, I started including weights, and when I say weights, I mean pretty light weights, using some cheap ass dumbbells at home. A typical workout would be, two to three times a week:\n\n4 sets of 25 pushups\n3 sets of 20 curls, 15lbs or 20 lbs\n3 sets of 12 shoulder presses, 15 to 20 lbs\n3 sets of 12 overhead extensions, 10 to 20 lbs\n3 sets of 12 standing dumbbell flys, 10 to 15 lbs\n3 sets of 25 situps\n3 sets of 12 squats (no weights)\nAnd a bunch of stretching\n\nI would say this pretty much got me close to the shape you see me in in the after picture. What took it the extra step was substituting my home weights workout with the gym. There I would pretty much repeat the same exercises, but add some similar exercises for my chest (flys) and my lats (rowing pulls). My mission was never to get too bulky, as given my age, all I wished was to be toned, and somehow I felt at my age, being too pumped made me conscientious (like I say, I am pretty shy). Besides, I am not particularly strong, and I have never really loved lifting heavy weights.\n\nAs for diet, over the last couple of years, I have learned that watching you diet is everything, and as you get older. Those extra pounds are waiting just around the corner for you. So, if you let your guard down, they will be back in no time. All along, I have not had a particularly special diet. For me, just knowing how many calories I am eating is the most important thing. Even now, I get uncomfortable being in a situation where I do not know the exact calorie content of my food, such as a restaurant or a party. The only conscious effort I make towards my diet is trying to eat about 100g of protein each day, and at least 25 g of fiber. I try to pack in vegetables when I can and every so often I will go through phases of eating high protein bars, or protein smoothies, but I am not especially rigorous about this. I don\u2019t really consider any food as bad, though I tend to avoid high fat food simply because it is so calorie dense, and often comes with a lot of cholesterol.\n\nMy BMI is currently about 20.5, and my body fat less than 10%. What I find odd/interesting is the response I get from my friends and colleagues, who see someone at my age with such a low (though I would say normal) BMI as an oddity. Often they comment that I must have a \u201chigh metabolism\u201d, or that I can eat anything. But, I quickly reassure them, no, I simply watch what I eat and do about 3 to 5 sessions of 30 min cardio each week. I\u2019m not going to say that it doesn\u2019t require effort, but I think it is a small price to pay.\n\nFor anyone who is thinking of starting out on such a journey, especially at my age, I just want to say, you really can do it. Just 3 to 6 months from now, you can be a very different person. In fact, it is not as hard as you think and the challenge can be invigorating. It is a state of mind more than anything. And a state of mind that pays off in so many areas. You can see from my before picture, I would shroud myself in baggy clothing and not give a crap how I looked, telling myself that it was not important. But once you slim down, you see that clothes look good on you, and you care about them. Other people start to take notice, and treat you differently (a sad but true fact). The confidence one gains, along with the health benefits are immense. I was lucky that I hadn\u2019t gotten absolutely huge, and certainly, at our age, you may want to speak to your physician to make sure you are good to venture out on such an endeavor, especially if you haven\u2019t exercised for a long time, but again, it is not as hard as you think.\n\nFinally, I know the first few weeks can be tough, but what I want to reassure you is that each week you will see positive changes, and that these will encourage you massively. I read somewhere about a guy that lost an immense amount of weight, and he said the same thing. So, yes, think about the goal and stay focused, but also enjoy the journey.\n\nI am sure there is a load I have missed, so feel free to ask me any questions if I can be of help.\n\ntl dr; middle aged guy starts taking care of his diet and exercising, and positive results follow \n\n\n\n\n**EDIT/MORE INFO**\n\nThanks everyone for your positive responses and encouragement!!! I just wanted to elaborate on a couple of points and questions people have brought up.\n\nAs you can probably grasp from my original post, I entered into this venture rather reluctantly, focusing more on weight loss than fitness (though the two kind of go together). It was only along the way that I realized there were many extra bonuses to being a healthier weight and these encouraged me. This probably impacted the way I entered my changes in diet and exercise.\n\nDIET: As several have pointed out, 1500 calories a day for a middle age guy can be tough. The double whammy is that not only is 1500 below a normal daily calorie requirement, I wasn\u2019t eating a normal daily requirement before starting and that is why I was getting bigger. So the drop to 1500 was probably more like taking 1000+ calories out of my daily eating. \n\nThe first few days it was tough, but as I say, it became a state of mind. I had a small breakfast (e.g coffee and smoothie), small lunch (e.g. granola bar or two) and a modest dinner (e.g. taco and small burrito, rice bowl etc.). Any exercise I did allowed me to eat more but I stuck to the calorie budget I entered into Loseit! In this early phase, I really did not want to allow myself any wiggle room. I was also fascinated to see if the numbers simply added up, i.e. could I see a weight loss that exactly matched the calorie deficit, and the answer was pretty much yes.\n\nGenerally, I have little trust of myself when food is around, and my previous experience had shown me that was justified. So, I tried to avoid environments where sudden random eating can occur, such as standing around a buffet at a party, eating the birthday cake someone brings into the office. Because of Loseit!, I put myself on what I called the \u201cbarcode\u201d diet, as by eating purchased food that had barcodes, I could get a very accurate measure of what I was eating, leaving me in no place to fudge numbers and underestimate portion sizes. Oddly, when eating out, I found myself eating more and more at fast food restaurants, not because they tasted great, but because (a) I knew the exact calorie content versus say a mom and pop restaurant who don\u2019t have to post that kind of information, (b) with the minimum of effort, I could control the portion size as I knew what it was before being given to me, and (c) it meant I would eat, well, generally fast, meaning it was less of a social event that could too easily become a food grazing event. \n\nEven now after 4 years of calorie counting, I still stick to these rules as far as I can, though in answer to some of the questions, no, I don\u2019t avoid candy (it\u2019s a major weakness in fact), or alcohol etc. I just make sure that if I eat that stuff, I pay for it by eating less of something else or doing extra exercise. There are however a few foods a tend to eat in larger amounts, such as non fat greek yogurt, cause of the high protein and calcium.\n\nEXERCISE: I realized all along that if exercise was  \u201chassle\u201d I would find a reason not to do it. That is why I chose biking and running, as I can literally do it from outside my front door. If I had to drive 30 mins to the gym, workout, wait around for machines, drive home, I would just say it wasn\u2019t worth the time to me. For that reason, I did the weights at home, as I could work them into my day \u2013 I would be doing household chores between sets! Also, and again this is the lifestyle change, I looked for opportunities to do exercise in my daily life, so that I wouldn\u2019t have to set aside time to do it later.  It\u2019s all the simple stuff \u2013 take the stairs, not the elevator. A subway ride and walking take the same time? Then walk. Hey, you may even learn something about your town. Even when you walk around the office, don\u2019t saunter, make it brisk. These little things add up.\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Inspired by the 35 year old guy who got in shape to post my story.

I was down in the dumps big time, all at the age of 18. I was made fun of, ridiculed, harassed you name it.

Quite embarrassing, but you can see the redness and swelling in my feet. \nhttp://imgur.com/jCyGZJW\n\nAnother picture as well, up-close of my face(be warned, its scary):\nhttp://imgur.com/Dj4Jh4x\n\nAnyways, before all of this though. I met my now wife, when I was 18 and at my biggest online gaming. I was scared, terrified to show her what I looked like at first. As soon as she even started to talk to me on Skype. I started starving myself, all kinds of things to try and get the weight off since I knew \"that day\" was coming where I couldn't hide any longer. \n\nAbout 5 months of us chatting on Skype, she hit me with talk about BeachBody. Let me tell you, shes 5 foot, 100 lbs, looks absolutely gorgeous to me at the time. Anyways, she bought herself Insanity, and I would listen in on her working out over Skype. I tell you, I felt like the biggest(literally) pile of shit out there. I had to do something, she was getting these amazing results. On top of everything, I already thought she could of done 100x better than me any day. I kept telling myself, I had to do something, I was going to lose someone that finally showed they cared about me. That thought right there, haunted me for months to come. I didn't want to be alone again, I finally felt loved and cared for, over the internet of all places. \n\nSo, shortly after that thought, I looked into getting my own program. I got P90 - quit it the next day. I about died, haha. She heard me try, and heard my rage-fail. Weeks went by, before I touched it again. One thing she didn't do, is push me to do it. Surprisingly, its like she knew I would get off my lazy ass and get to it, eventually. I think with all the guilt of her constantly working out and me falling more and more in-love with her, finally did it for me. That point on, no matter what I kept going. \n\nPounds started flying off, 550 - 540 - 520 - 500 - 450, it just dwindled down from age 19 to 21. \n\nNow, I am a new man. \n\nHere I am, today. \nhttp://imgur.com/EMTJrcl\n\nAs you can see, I have tons of extra skin on me sadly. But hey, I did it. I got pecs, I got bi's, I got calves. I look back, and I can't believe I am here. \n\nOn top of that, my wife told me to \"stop being a shy little bitch\" and tell people about it. So yeah, here I am. \n\nHere is a picture of the both of us together nearly 8 months ago on our wedding day in Lima, Peru. \nhttp://www.chrisaivey.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1385231_10153456082745451_956857949_n.jpg\n\n(please dont break my website >_<, I don't think this will get much attention so I did not imgur it!)\n\nAnd yes, still going through the paperwork to get the woman who gave me a life to the states! \n\nAnyways, I am down to 250 lbs, no longer bigger than my refrigerator, tons of extra skin on my body.

I keep track of my calories I take in on myfitnesspal, and I aim for around 1700-2000 calories a day.  I workout 5-6 times a week, including cardio and weight lifting.  I also managed to complete two rounds of Insanity, which is probably the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nI've fallen off track a few times.

I was fat, shy, and depressed, I hated how I looked and felt. I was a redditor for awhile, but I then stumbled upon r/fitness. Determined to change myself for the better, you guys gave me inspiration. I read the FAQ, and my weight loss journey began.\n\nExercise: My first six months was pretty fuckity. I would \"workout\" three days a week. My workout would be twenty minutes on an elipctical, then do a circuit on the machines, full body. I didn't really under stand reps, sets, and to scared to use free weights (what a twat move).\n\nSecond half of my first year, I gave Strong Lifts a try based on the recommendation of this subreddit, not much to say, did stronglifts for 6 months.\nStart of my second year I did a bro-split: M:Chest/tris Tues:Legs Thurs: Back/Bis Fri:Shoulders, rest three days maybe cardio (rarely did it though).\nSummer of 2014 to now: I do a modified version of PHAT, and I bicycled almost everyday during the summer.\n\nLifts: \n\nBench: 95lbs->185lbs\n\nSquats: 135lbs->265lbs\n\nDeadLift: 135lbs->285lbs\n\nOHP: 45lbs ->105lbs\nStats are reps of 5, I don't do 1RM\n\nDiet:Cutting out calories from liquids was a big part of weight loss in the begining, I would drink a lot! Gallon of chocolate milk? Drink that in a day, on top of food. Orange juice, half carton, pop, a whole liter. Once I stopped drinking my calories, and eating junk food,  like chips, and fast food, I really started to lose weight. I currently eat around 1600-1800 calories a day. I don't eat much carbs, most come from fruit (I eat obscene amount of fruit, been known to eat a whole pineapple in one setting), veggies, and skim milk. High protein diet 140-160 grams of protein a day, and the rest whatever, I don't really follow my fat and carb macros.\n\nTips/Ancedotes: This may not apply to all of you who are trying to lose weight, or beginging on your fitness journey but here is my biggest advice: YOU ARE GOING TO FUCK UP! Sucess is just a series of continous fuck-ups, in till you fuck up less and less. You may fuck up a lot, eat to much, miss a workout, but remember, how you fucked up yesterday doesn't mean you will fuck up today. You are tough. Also find a program, and stick to it, lift weights, do cardio, a sport, but just stick to it.\n\nThank you /r/Fitness I am a much happier person now than I was two years ago. I feel great, I am a healthier person now, you guys literally saved my life.\n\nCurrent Goals: Started my first bulk in September, and ended it this november (short bulk). Ate 2500 calories and gained five pounds, I really just wanted to get stronger, I was sick of my strength plataeu, so I did a short bulk.

Simple sugars are rapidly absorbed from the digestive tract raising blood sugar abruptly.  Fiber slows the absorption of sugars slowing the rate of blood sugar rise.  In a state where the body needs a lot of energy quickly, a rapid blood sugar rise will be controlled by rapid cell use of the energy. \n\nHowever, when overall energy supply is high and utilization is low as with the current US lifestyle and diet, the blood sugar is not needed for energy as fast as it is being absorbed.  The blood sugar is then converted to the fat triglyceride in the liver.  Once converted these triglycerides are put into the circulation to be delivered to fat tissue for storage.  Fat production and storage is as much related to the pace at which sugars are absorbed as it is the overall amount in a given meal.  This is where fiber is supposed to come in.\n\nWhen adequate natural fiber exists in the meal slowing the absorption of sugars, the blood sugar rise is spread over a longer time interval allowing cell energy usage to keep up with energy intake.  The net result is that little or none should be converted to fat.  Two foods can be eaten with the identical calories and grams of sugar, yet they result in very different patterns of energy usage versus fat production.  Slowly absorbed carbohydrate is termed \u201clow glycemic\u201d load, while quickly absorbed carbohydrate is termed \u201chigh glycemic load\u201d.\n\nThe high-glycemic meal results in a rapid blood sugar rise in the first hour which results in a high insulin output to lower blood sugar.  As the cell requirements are not this great in the first hour, much of that sugar is sent to the liver and converted to triglyceride for fat storage.  This happens aggressively in the presence of high insulin resulting in the blood sugar dropping back to the fasting level in just a little over 2 hours.  This triggers hunger and thus a desire to eat again sooner.\n\nThe low glycemic load meal can contain the same calories and grams of carbohydrate but in a slowly digestible form.  The result is a very gradual blood sugar rise, much lower insulin output and complete use of the sugars for energy rather than for triglyceride production.  The gradual absorption of sugars over 4 hours sustaining energy levels suppresses the hunger response for a much longer interval.\n\nRemember, these two meals contain the exact same carbohydrate grams and calories, yet they have much different effects on fat production and hunger response.  Given this dynamic, what determines and controls the glycemic load of different carbohydrates is important.  The simplest and most useful marker is the sugar to fiber ratio.\n\nRemarkably, a good whole food, low glycemic load diet has about a 1:1 sugar to fiber ratio.  The current U.S. average is about 12:1.  This is the result of both adding sugar to just about all manufactured foods and the removal of fiber during processing.  The 1:1 ratio in a whole food diet comes from about 50 grams of natural sugars per day and about 45 grams of natural fiber.  The average daily intake of fiber in the U.S. is about 12-15 grams, while the average sugar intake is 180-220 grams.\n\nWhy would we be refining fiber out and adding huge amounts of sugar to almost everything when it has important adverse health effects?   Sugar drives consumption and fiber drives satiety or the signal \u201cI have had enough\u201d.  A high sugar to fiber ratio artificially manipulated in food gets us to consume and therefore buy more food.\n\n[Clip from the documentary \"Fed Up\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0ih67FsRNY)", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Cutting Fat?

The bulk of the scientific literature uses subjects that are either completely untrained, or, at best, \"somewhat trained,\" but I was interested in seeing what sort of impact these factors had on strength gains in people who actually take lifting seriously.\n\nSo, I hit up [Open Powerlifting](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/) and downloaded their dataset of powerlifting meet results.  I filtered the results down to people who'd competed at least twice and had complete data.  For all analyses, I was interested in the relative rate of strength gains someone could expect (i.e. % increase)\n\nHere's the short version of the results:\n\n1) Mean relative increases were slightly larger for women, but the effect was small (if you're familiar with Cohen's D, the effect size was 0.21)\n\n2) Initial strength level was negatively associated with the subsequent rate of strength gains, but the effect was very weak (low r and r^2 values), and seemed to primarily be driven by people in the lowest 2 or 3 strength deciles.\n\n3) Age was negatively associated with the subsequent rate of strength gains, but the effect was also very weak (even weaker than initial strength level), and seemed to primarily be driven by kids and teenagers.\n\nWhen putting all three of those factors into a multiple regression model, they could only explain 11.4% of the variation in the rate of strength gains.  That means nearly 90% of the variation is due to factors like individual variation/genetics, various training factors, taking care of business outside the gym, and random noise.  In other words, you shouldn't expect that any easily-quantifiable aspects about yourself (age, sex, current strength level) are very predictive of the sort of progress you should expect.\n\nSince this was a retrospective analysis, all standard caveats apply.  The lifters had free choice over how they trained, ate, slept, etc. so the only real \"control\" is that, presumably, everyone was trying pretty hard to get stronger since they were competitive lifters.  While that's a significant drawback, the upside is that the dataset is was bigger than you could ever hope to gather in a prospective study, and the training status of the people in this analysis was way higher, on average, than you'll see in the vast majority of the research on the subject.\n\nIf you're interested in the details and visual representations of the data, you can check out the article here (full disclosure - I wrote this article and it's on my website):  [How Sex, Strength, and Age Affect Strength Gains in Powerlifters](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/predict-strength-gains/).", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "How Age, Strength, and Sex Impact Strength Gains: Analysis of Meet Results from ~20,000 Powerlifters", "post_ups": 1762, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8wdrox/how_age_strength_and_sex_impact_strength_gains/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:20.017254", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "tectactoe", "post_created_utc": 1513015684.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1513080694.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "7j3y8d", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 281, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1762, "post_selftext": ">**RETROACTIVE EDIT [171212]:** First of all, I want to say thank you to anybody and everybody that responded with legitimate advice, even if it was just \"take a break!\" Sometimes it's hard to convince your own mind that you need to do something until you hear experiences from others who have been-there/done-that and came out on top. \n\n>Secondly, I had no idea this would get so big, I honestly was afraid it would get deleted by the mods but I'm glad it has spurred some discussion - something I wasn't expecting when I decided to post my personal rant. Even reading over the comments yesterday, I've learned quite a bit. It just goes to show you, even after seven years, there's still so much more to learn. I will do my best to get through the comments and reply to everyone that's posed a question, but it might take me some time!\n\n>Third, I have taken the last ~2 weeks off and I already feel mentally better. Not ready to go jumping back into heavy squats/deads at 5am just yet, but I'm learning to become more \"mentally okay\" with the idea that I have absolutely no reason to NEED to lift that much, other than personal pride. A lot of people suggested putting my acquired strength to use - I've decided after the new year, I'm going to look into boxing classes/lessons. There are a few places near me that offer them once or twice a week, ranging anywhere from 30-90 minute sessions, so I think I'll be able to fit it into my schedule, even with the new baby. I've always wanted to learn how to box, honestly don't know why I hadn't looked into this sooner. Not only that, but it will help my cardiovascular health/endurance, which kind of sucks right now to be honest.\n\n>Lastly, to the few who commented that this was some kind of humblebrag, or conversely that I was full of shit and haven't been lifting that long, or can't lift the weight I've said -- well, I'm sorry you feel that way. But I don't see how it's \"bragging\" to basically admit that the thing you use to love is making you hate waking up in the morning or even dread going to bed the night before. To those of you who think I'm lying about my numbers? That's not what I'm here for. But if you look at my post history you can see about one year ago, I posted a video of my first ever 500 lb dead lift (Dec 20th of last year) and it's still on Youtube. It's safe to assume that I've added some weight to that lift since then, no? Even still, I stand nothing to gain from lying about my numbers, and I feel sorry for you if that's what you think this is about. To everyone else who replied: THANK YOU.\n\n---\n\nSo maybe this isn't the best topic of discussion, because the answer could always be, *\"stop being a bitch, you're just afraid of hard work.*\n\nBut I can tell you that's not the case. Within the last (almost) seven years, I've been consistently hitting the gym, starting with P90x, moving to Starting Strength, ICF, 5/3/1, and finally Beyond 5/3/1, which I'm currently doing. I have never taken more than a week off at a time over those seven years, and only when absolutely necessary (broken finger, vacation, traveling for work), probably about one week off every 6 months over the last seven years.\n\nWith my current situation (wife, house, new baby) I need to workout before work, I have no time at lunch and I have more important matters to attend to at home after work. This constitutes me getting up every day at 5:00 so I can be at the gym by 5:30 when they open.\n\nThe problem is, I'm getting burned out. Severely. Not even so much physically (my body feels fine, for the most part) but mentally. Getting up at 5:00 to go squat 400 lbs is becoming dreadful, honestly. Even to the point where I start feeling bad about it the night before. I have pushed myself to be consistent and work through the mental blocks, but it's getting to the point where it's casting a shadow of doom over my whole life. It's like my life revolves around the gym and I HATE that.\n\nOf course I love being strong and in shape, but not at the expense of my mental health. And the thing is, I don't compete in body building, or power lifting, so this is literally just a leisurely activity for me, and nothing more. I do it to look and feel good -- and bodily-wise, I do -- but mentally, I hate it.\n\nMy workouts take way too long ( I think ). Most days are close to 1 hr 45 mins, with leg day taking closer to 2 hrs and back day taking 2.5 hours. One problem could be the Wendler sets. For example, on dead lift day, I'll do the following:\n\n>3 warm up sets\n\n>2 prescribed work sets, increasing in weight\n\n>1 \"as many as possible\" set (increased weight)\n\n>3 \"joker sets\" (increased weight)\n\n>3 \"light\" sets, (decreased weight, maybe like 3x10)\n\nAnd then I'll go on and end up doing 6 more exercises for back day. Like T Bar Row, Yates Rowes, Lat Bar Pull Downs, Single Arm Dumbbell Rows, Overhead Lat Raises, Pull Ups. So this takes me like 2.5 hours to do and I just can't do it anymore.\n\nYou can call it wimping out if you want. Hell, maybe it is. But I just want to go back to the times where going to the gym was fun. I don't enjoy my routine anymore. It's grueling and it's unnecessary for this point in my life. I want something that I can do 4x week in under an hour.\n\nBUT, I also don't want to completely lose my physique or strength. I mean, I know I can't expect to work less (or less hard) and stay the same size/strength, but I don't want to sacrifice it all, either. If that were the case, I'd just diet and do cardio for an hour each day.\n\nAnother thing is eating that's killing me, and buying food is too damn expensive, especially with a baby now. I eat ~4000 calories per day on lift days (4x/week) and 3500 on off days. It's too much. I can't eat that damn much anymore, but that was the only wait for me to slowly gain weight. Even eating like that, I have kind of leveled off around 208 lbs body weight.\n\nSO, what's the point of all this?\n\nI'm looking for advice. I mean, I looked through the list of routines, but I need advice from someone who's maybe been in a similar situation as me, as to which one would be the best. Looking for something I can do in an hour or less, 4x/week (maybe even 3x/week?) but still maintain good physique and strength, and ideally I'd like to eat around 3k calories per day. I think that's manageable within how much I can afford and how much I can physically eat without making myself sick. If I lose a little strength or size, so be it, but I don't want to FEAR the gym anymore. I'm tired of being so mentally... tired.\n\n**tl;dr** I've worked my ass off for 7 years with nonstop high intensity. It's been rewarding as hell, but it's becoming mentally exhausting. Spending too much time eating and too much money on food to maintain size/strength (3.5-4k calories per day), spending too much time in the gym (1.5-2.5 hrs per session), and due to some life changes (my age, my new baby, my mental health), it's time for me to ramp down the intensity and just maintain with something I can complete without HATING my time in the gym. Any suggestions?\n\nThank you anyone who read this far!", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Lifting seriously for ~7 years, been doing Beyond 531 for the last 2 years.

I've seen videos of him doing this exercise with a barbell and a ridiculous amount of weight, it's great to see him explain why he does it that way. Kiril Sarychev (BP record holder) is also in the room and they did a (shorter) interview with him as well. There's some videos in Russian floating around (with translation) in which Kiril also stresses the point that back extensions as a warm-up and a standard accessory are incredibly important for keeping your back strong and healthy and improving form in other lifts. \n\nI've adopted back extensions as part of my warm-up for a while now and do 1 or 2 sets with a small bar (no weights) prior to my workout. I also do weighted sets as an accessory on squat/front squat days now. Pressing the bar in your neck takes some getting used to but it's definitely helped. My upper back feels more stable during squats and as a bonus, your neck gets a little stronger too in ways you couldn't train otherwise. For those who sometimes suffer mild lower back discomfort due to heavy lifting, this could certainly help.\n\nWould advise this for everyone. Better yet, watch the entire video.

I didn't really have anyone to share this with as most of my friends have stopped working out as they have settled down into family life, so I thought I would share my experience.  I am currently 28 y/o male weighing 183lbs and just over 6' tall.  I repped out 2 each of 425lb DL, 265lb BP, and 325lb squat last night.\n\nMost of my knowledge and mindset in the gym has come from playing division one football in college.  I have also sprinkled in some HIIT ideas from \"Insanity.\"  Two winters ago after mainly focusing on appearance rather than strength I made a conscious decision to really involve my legs more in my workout.  The change came after seeing a photo of myself wakeboarding in which my upper body was comically bigger than my skinny legs.  \n\nI really concentrated on form for the first couple months, keeping my squat and deadlift weight around 135lbs.  I would start every workout with 3-4 sets of around 10-15 reps, usually involving 4-5 day splits.  I was rotating squats, deadlifts, step-ups with dumbbells, and the leg press machine at the start of every workout.  As my career has taken off I have been forced to 2-3 day splits as such I have more recovery in between workouts, however less time in the gym.\n\nI still rotate those 4 leg exercises with a 2-3 day split at the beginning of every workout.  Then I usually do a push-pull upper body consisting of chest/back, shoulders/traps, biceps/triceps.  My chest has always been the weakest part of my body so I will favor chest days.\n\nThis winter I stumbled upon Brandon Campbell's YouTube videos.  This inspired me to really concentrate on building strength rather than just appearance.  His form and breathing techniques are what contributed most to my gains.  I highly suggest watching his deadlift and squat \"What works for me\" videos.\n\nThe main change after watching these videos was going from 10 rep sets to 2-3 rep sets.  This allowed my to really increase weight on all my leg exercises.  If I failed before 3 reps I would take off 10 lbs and always finish.  For example if I was squatting 315 and could only do 2 I would go down to 305 and rep out 1 more.  This was more of a mental thing for me as in my head I felt I \"completed\" that set.\n\nIn terms of diet I haven't changed much for the last two years.  I don't have a strict \"meal plan.\"  Every weekday morning I start with two scoops of Athlete's Food meal replacement, along with two heaping tablespoons of non-fat yogurt, and almond milk.  Lunch consists of a wrap or if my company cafeteria is serving fish I choose that option.  After work I drink 1 scoop of AF and 1 scoop of Optimum Nutrition whey protein with 2 tablespoons of yogurt and almond milk again.  After my workout I eat either fish or chicken with either steamed broccoli or boil-in-a-bag brown rice and black beans.  Before bed I drink 2 scoops of ON whey protein again with the yogurt and almond milk.  On weekends I eat pretty much whatever I want.  (I must mention that I have always favored healthy foods, for example I've never liked sweets, chocolate, fried food, etc.)  My snacks usually consist of fruits, nuts, or hummus.  In the winter I am more lax and allow myself to cheat more often, in the summer I am much more strict and completely cut out cheese (except for cottage cheese).\n\nI would be happy to answer any more questions if anyone is interested.  Thanks for reading.\n\nEDIT: [Wakesurfing photo](http://imgur.com/RfPRP1H) as requested.

For most of my late child years and teenage years, I was frankly very overweight. I wasn't like this as a young kid, but I started to develop worse and worse habits as time went on. I always wanted a change, but I never really had the motivation to start. However, this changed late may of this year.\n\n\n   For school PE, we had a unit on weight lifting, and I loved it! Although my numbers were nothing to be proud of, I still thoroughly enjoyed myself. After  the unit, I wanted to continue doing it, so my brother started taking me to his Uni's gym every Sunday with my other brother and his friend. This continued for the majority of the remainder of the school year, and partially into summer. \n\n\n   It was on June 6th, 2015, that I finally had enough and decided to truly try to change my life around. That was my peak weight, at 245 and 5'10. I went on a diet of 1800 calories or less, which mostly came from protein. I fell in love with chicken over the course of the summer, and I still do to this day.\n\n\n  For exercising, I swam 5 days a week for swim team each morning, and often times I would go to afternoon practice because a girl I was crushing hard on had summer PE, so she had to get extra hours in, but that's another story. In addition to that, my brother started me on Starting Strength, which I did 3-4 times a week. However, he switched out clean and jerk (I believe that's what the other exercise is) with pull-ups, and while at the time I absolutely loathed him for it because I had to do them on the machine, they ended up becoming my favorite exercise. My numbers when I started lifting, my peak maxes from the summer, and my current numbers now are:\n\n\nSquat: 45 Lbs 3x5, 185 3x5, 185 3x5\n\nBench: 115 1x1, 135 2x3, 135 2x3\n\nDeadlift: 115 1x5, 225 1x5, 175 2x5\n\nPullups: Couldn't do them without assistance... I can now do 10 full dead hang pullups.\n\n\n   As of now, I am currently working on rebuilding my numbers to what they used to be. I became tired of SS so I started doing my own thing, and while its fun, I neglected deadlift, a lot. When I finally returned, I could barely do 1x5 135 lbs. Currently, I still don't have a set program for lifting, as I don't have much time anymore. This is due to me signing up for wrestling which I have 5 days a week. I've never done a school sport before, and I hate contact sports, but I thought it was worth a shot so I joined the team. While it is kicking my ass, I'm enjoying it more and more each day, but most importantly, I'm making friends, which is so awesome for me. I used to be very social, but once I started gaining weight, I lost confidence in myself. Now a days, I am finding myself to be more comfortable with myself and my body, so I'm loving that I have friends now! (Oh and remember the girl I was crushing hard on this summer? Shes kind of my girlfriend now :) Sorry, had to throw that in there, couldn't refuse!) \n\n\nTL;DR Was a fat ass, now slightly less of a fatass.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Never too early to start! 15 M 245-180 5'11", "post_ups": 1752, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3x15pi/never_too_early_to_start_15_m_245180_511/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:20.017254", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "IDespiseYourIcon", "post_created_utc": 1382884022.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1382917034.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "1pbcg5", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 725, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1747, "post_selftext": "I'm a really heavy guy. I didn't think it mattered, I'd justify it to myself as \"It's a filter, to keep away superficial people\" or something, but growing up first impressions are formed by appearance; it's a fact, that's the way it is. And I'd like to start changing my appearance and become healthier. But I have no idea what to do.\n\nI read through the FAQ.\n\n> * Weight, Height, Sex, and Age\n* Your Goals (weight loss, muscle, etc)\n* Any injuries or disorders that we should know about? (Diabetes, broken ankle, etc)\n* Do you smoke? (If yes, stop. Stop now.)\n* History of diet or exercise (What have you tried? What worked? What didn't?)\n* Do you have access to a gym?\n\n\n\n* Roughly ~136kg / ~300lb / ~21.4 stone , 6ft on the dot / 180cm, Male, 18; turning 19 in 2 weeks.\n* I want to lose all of this fat. Gaining muscle would be a bonus, if they can be done at the same time as the FAQ says. I'm good at hiding the fat under my black shirts and darker clothing; I'm enormous, I have more skin with stretch marks than skin without, basically.\n* No physical injuries. However I've been in denial, and don't want to go to the doctors, but I think I may have diabetes, and it wouldn't surprise me. I'm tired 100% of the time, weigh over twice what my friends weigh, and I pee a lot, and need the sugar. I will go soon enough, I've decided to get healthy.\n* None whatsoever. I gorge myself on fatty foods everyday, it's time I want to change. If I had to give my average daily meal, I'd say for breakfast I have 4 slices of white toast with peanut butter spread and probably soft drink to drink, if no soft drink apple and blackcurrant juice. Between breakfast and lunch I'd have walked from the station to Uni and be really tired, so I'd get a milk drink and a chocolate bar. For lunch, another milk drink, with a nutella sandwich, a sandwich with chicken probably, or bung fritz, along with a packet of chips, a milo/nutrigrain bar. For dinner I'd have whatever the family haves, which can range from anywhere from chicken to roast pork or lamb, schnitzels, various pastas, enchiladas, burgers (homemade), normally all served with potato chips or potato gems.\n* Yes. I live somewhat rural, but there's a gym ~15km away that I can drive to quite easily.\n\nBasically University is finishing up in 2 weeks, exams will be over. My physics and mathematics mind will be free to gorge on video games and food for 4 months like every summer holidays is; but I don't want that this time. \n\nI want to look good.\n\nMy main questions and concerns are I'd say:\n\n* How much should I exercise? Every day? Is that too much for starting out?\n* What should I exercise for fat-burning and some muscle gain? Treadmil? The bars with the weights on the end? I really am lost.\n* What do I eat? This one is the hardest part for me. I'm willing to put in the physical effort associated with going to the gym, but my tastebuds have different ideas. I cannot physically eat lettuce/tomato/carrots basically any and all vegetables, my mouth just cannot stomach the texture and the taste, it's abhorrent. I want to eat it, but I can't, my mind and tastebuds are somehow still in 10 year old chicken nugget mode. How do I break free? Do I NEED to eat lettuce/tomato and all of the vegetables? What is keto? Will that be better for a larger person like myself?\n\nAny, literally any help or guidance at all would be hugely appreciated. If I'm posting in the wrong place, I apologise immensely, and will remove the post, or go somewhere else or something; I don't know.\n\nI'm just tired of being tired.\n\nEDIT: [A link to an album of myself for size/body recommendations, or something.

Often they're a weak link in our bodies, which can result serious injuries putting us out for months. Here's just a few things I've learnt over the past week or so I'd like to pass on to help you guys:\n\n**Anatomy:**\n\nThe rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that acts to stabilise and move the shoulder. It is made up of the:\n\n1. supraspinatus - abducts the arm (equal abduction power as deltoid)\n2. infraspinatus - externally rotates the arm\n3. teres minor - externally rotates the arm\n4. subscapularis - internally rotates humerus (upper arm)\n\n**Testing flexibility:**\n\nYou may find it useful to gauge how flexible your shoulders are before you begin to stretch them. It helps to see your progress as you increase flexibility in the area. To test your shoulder range of motion:\n\n1. Reach one hand behind the back so that the back of your hand rests on your middle back. Now slide your hand upwards, along the spine, until you reach your shoulder blades. Repeat with both hands, checking if one side can reach further.\n\n2. Do the same but this time reach one hand behind your head and slide it down your neck. Try to reach your shoulder blades again, doing it with both sides.\n\n**Stretching & Strengthening:**\n\nSince the muscles making up the rotator cuffs are relatively small in size but are still relied on for a lot of work, this puts them at danger of being torn (due to trauma) or inflamed (from overuse). Here are a few videos and articles, which really helped me:\n\n[Warmup & active isolated stretches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luoiGpT4PJ8)\n\n[Shoulder dislocations & broomstick stretches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4c95kosHes)\n\n[Broomstick stretches & doorframe stretches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K938ohitkWo)\n\n[Corner stretches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz13wVcULxM)\n\n[Strengthening](http://www.criticalbench.com/bench-press-blowout.htm)\n\nDoing these stretches on a daily basis will definitely help you healthy shoulders, while preventing future injuries.\n\n\nP.S. First \"article\" I've written, tell me if there's anything I can improve on.\n\n**EDIT:** \n\nSome guys wanted me to include things on improving the stabilisers in the shoulder, which will help more with the weights room. The stretches above are aimed more at those with problems with their rotator cuffs not those looking to improve performance. If you're looking to strengthen and stabilise them, you're going to want to read this:\n\n[T-Nation shoulder stabilisation](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/smart_overhead_pressing)\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the gold!", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Rotator cuffs", "post_ups": 1747, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2vndjk/rotator_cuffs/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:20.017254", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "Idonthaveanaccount9", "post_created_utc": 1536619551.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1536671453.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "9erwty", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 1155, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1740, "post_selftext": "Do you go to bed hungry?

How much can your body use at once?\n* Are dirty bulks necessary, or can lean muscle be added without fat gain?\n* How many sets are shown to work best for muscle gains?

However, while this measure provides a convenient method for calculating volume, it fails to take into account the amount of work performed during the allotted time frame. For example, a bout involving 40 repetitions of an exercise at 80% 1 repetition maximum (RM) would amount to substantially more work completed than the same number of repetitions performed at 50% 1RM. Hence, the concept of volume-load (VL) has been put forth to equate for differences in workload (1). VL is broadly defined as the product of repetitions and amount of weight lifted (i.e., [repetitions (no.) \u00d7 external load (kg)]) (1). By factoring load into the equation, a more representative perspective on the true effects of volume can be achieved when comparing different resistance training protocols.\"\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Science of Growth, Hypertrophy, and Building Muscle w/ Brad Schoenfeld", "post_ups": 1735, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7h4faw/science_of_growth_hypertrophy_and_building_muscle/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:20.017254", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Tovero", "post_created_utc": 1405308718.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1405361567.0, "post_gilded": 1, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 1, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2amy2e", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 538, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1738, "post_selftext": "Early last month I deadlifted 315 and posted about it on reddit.

If you are trying to push yourself to the max every workout then maybe take a week or 2 to deload then start your training cycle again. The same can be said if you aren't pushing yourself weekly. I found deadlifting twice per week to be optimal, almost like the stronglifts 5x5 routine. \n\n#2 Check Your Technique\n\nProbably the most important tip, technique really is everything and can improve your deadlift almost overnight. It will take a while to get used to the new technique but you will soon be able to push past your previous best. There are countless videos on youtube that will show you how to deadlift correctly, however these are my favourite. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IrGcJtV79o https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYREQkVtvEc\n\n#3 Purchase Some Straps\n\nI honestly never believed in using straps, but after I bought myself a pair I think I'll be using them alot more often. I would recommend checking out [this article for a guide](https://gymtips.co/best-weight-lifting-straps/) on which lifting straps to buy. I recommend using your straps on only a handful of sets, not your entire workout.\n\n#4 Work On Your Lower-Body Mobility\n\nAgain very important, you can't expect to pull some good weight if you have tight hamstrings/glutes etc. Make sure you are regularly foam rolling and stretching. \n\n**Check these out:**\n\nKneeling Hip Flexor Stretch - This is one of the best stretches for releasing hip flexor tightness. https://youtu.be/YQmpO9VT2X4\n\nPsoas Quad Stretch - The psoas major is a pelvic muscle that plays a key role in hip flexion. https://youtu.be/CGe36jc-2DM\n\nFoam Rolling -  https://breakingmuscle.com/fitness/what-is-a-foam-roller-how-do-i-use-it-and-why-does-it-hurt and http://blog.paleohacks.com/foam-rolling/\n\n#5 Do Accessory Movements\n\nDeadlifts work a ton of different muscles, not just your back and your hamstrings. You also need to focus on your accessory movements. Accessory movements are extremely important because they help ensure you aren't developing any weak areas. The accessory movements you should focus on are pullups, barbell bent-over rows, stiff-legged deadlifts, calve raises, good mornings and even squats.\n\n---\n\nHopefully these tips help you out like they helped me!", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "5 Practical Tips To Increase Your Deadlift", "post_ups": 1729, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/6upgm9/5_practical_tips_to_increase_your_deadlift/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:20.017254", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "SwervePurposely", "post_created_utc": 1377728696.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1377729666.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "1lagog", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 393, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1725, "post_selftext": "\n2 months ago, I posted [my 2 months progress thread.](https://pay.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1h8vf0/my_life_changing_2_month_transformation_cant_wait/)  I was amazed by the response from reddit and have since been grinding my ass off.  Thank you to everyone who commented in that thread and anyone who comments in this one.  I know it sounds like I'm exaggerating, but the responses I received from people telling me how I inspired them meant a lot to me and fueled me to continue pushing myself.  4 months ago, I wouldn't have imagined someone looking towards me for inspiration, so it is quite a feeling to experience. \n\n**Currently: 5'11\" ~180lb**\n\n**Photo: [Before \\(5/1\\) and After (8/28)](http://i.imgur.com/l8PEGV3.jpg)**\n\n[**Photo: 4 Months Side by Side Panels**](http://i.imgur.com/EhqBNLp.jpg)\n\n[**Photo: Rear Double Bicep a few weeks ago**](http://i.imgur.com/7qEBahZ.jpg)\n\n\n**MY STORY**\n\nI talked about this in my last thread, but my journey began with a girl.  I expressed myself to her and was met with rejection. My feelings were hurt badly, and it caused me to take a step back and reevaluate my current state, both emotionally and physically - my sense of humor, habits, hobbies, level of activity, and of course, my fitness.  Soon enough, it made sense as to why I was met with rejection.  I decided to say fuck it to the way I was living and change myself completely overnight. I started going to the gym every day and made an effort to treat people better as often as possible.  I was excited for this change, mainly because I was going after that girl, but also because my future looked promising. \n\nSince high school, I had been an anxious mess.  I am a prime example of someone who had no confidence but had no reason to feel that way. I've always been a fairly upbeat, sociable person and was an athlete in high school.  For some reason though, the world scared me.  I was scared of judgment, nervous about what people thought of me, and I **ALWAYS** assumed the worst.  \n\nGetting into shape has completely changed my mindset.  I am proud of myself for the first time in a while - proud of who I am and what I was able to accomplish this summer.  It was no easy feat and it will continue to be challenging, but doing something challenging and pushing through it to reach your goals lets you know what you are made of.\n_____________________\n\n**DIET**\n\n(*I am lactose intolerant*)\n\nFrom 0 ---> 1.5 months, I cut hard and lifted heavy.  I began by watching my intake, meaning no more soda, no more McDonalds and no more Domino's.  When I got home from school for the summer, I had more control over the food I was having and quickly started taking it seriously. I counted my calories using MyFitnessPal and wouldn't allow myself over my calorie limit (which was actually lower than it needed to be at the time). As you can see from the picture, I shredded the fat.  During the beginning of my cut, when I was getting into lifting, I didn't do any cardio.  Halfway through my cut, I started doing cardio daily. I used the Arc Trainer, a machine similar to an elliptical and set it to a mode where the intensity varied every 2 minutes. I pushed my ass off and burned a lot of calories doing this for ~25 minutes a day. I kept track of my calories burned (whether accurate or not) and aimed to beat myself every day.  If I wasn't dripping all over the machine, I was doing something wrong. \n\n**What I ate on my cut:** (1800 calories/day - probably could have been higher)\n\n* *Breakfast* - Omelette/Eggs and Wheat Toast\n* *Lunch* - Turkey/Tuna/Grilled chicken on Wheat\n* *Dinner* - Grilled chicken, veggies galore, brown rice/wheat pasta, salad\n* *Other* - 1-2 scoops of Isopure Whey Isolate pretty much daily. My protein goals were very high - pretty much my body weight in grams, so 180+ a day. Whether or not I need/needed this much is questionable.\n\n\n**What I ate when I started slow-bulking** (2800-3300 a day. If I were being optimal I'd be getting 3300 every day) \n\nI still ate everything above, just more of it, and more snacks.  I am still eating clean, just more of it and being a bit less strict with my diet.  Truthfully, I need to be eating more if I want to gain size, but I am working on leaning out right now and will figure out the whole bulking thing later. **Eating a lot of clean food is expensive.** And surprisingly, eating more can be just as hard as eating less sometimes. \n\n*Alcohol* - a few drinks occasionally, but I pretty much drank nothing during my cuts and only a few beers here and there on my slow-bulk. \n\n\n\n\n_____________________\n\n\n**LIFTS**\n\nI have a back injury (disc degeneration at my L5 S1) which prevents me from squatting and deadlifting often and/or heavy.  Because of this, I don't keep track of many lifts. Here is what I do know\n\n\n**Bench**\n\n* 5/1 - 135 x 6\n* 6/28 - 185 x 5; 1RM: ~210\n* 7/20 - 1RM: 225\n* 7/30 - 1RM: 230\n\nSince I've started leaning out in the past few weeks, my bench has stalled.  All of my other lifts have been increasing. I don't count calories anymore, but I am probably eating at maintenance right now.\n________\n\n**ROUTINE**\n\nI lift ~2 hours a day 6 days a week and take one rest day. I typically do the 3 day split twice in a row, then rest. Abs every other day lately.\n\n**My current 3 day split:** Chest/Biceps, Back/Triceps, Shoulders/Legs.  \n\nOver the past few months, I have increased the volume in my workouts. I may be doing too much, but I enjoy the high volume and always like to burn out with some light weight sets to make sure I've worked myself hard. \n\n\n**[Here is a screenshot showing pretty much what I do.](http://i.imgur.com/dNs04xm.png)** It varies occasionally.  \n\n\n______\n**MENTALITY**\n\nI talked about this in my last thread, but your mindset is extremely important when you're lifting.  That girl I mentioned ended up treating me pretty badly for a number of reasons, but I have her to thank for giving me that fire in the gym that propelled me to push myself and train as hard as I could.  Not everyone gets their motivation through anger though.  \n\nI made a thread about lifting mentality [here](https://pay.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1it5dw/you_can_probably_lift_more_than_you_think_mental/).  Basically all I'm saying is: find something that motivates you. Dig deep and figure out what sets you off or pumps you up  or gives you an adrenaline rush.  I'm speaking from experience when I say that doing this has literally allowed me to lift more - get an extra set or that last rep that you need or hit a 1 RM you've been pushing for.   You'd be surprised what you are capable of.  Bring it out to the surface and shock yourself. \n\nI personally take a preworkout and it really helps on the long days after work or if I am feeling lethargic. It's not necessary, but it has definitely helped me.  \n\n\nOther things that have helped me:\n\n* Music: I cycle between rap and chill music.  Some days, I feel like zoning in and listening to instrumentals. Others, I play kanye/big sean/trap/other pump up stuff and it gets me going.  Either way, having the right song on is very important to me.\n\n* Youtube: [Kai Greene's Train with Kai series](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kai+greene+training&oq=kai+greene+training&gs_l=youtube.3..0l10.35.1981.0.2068.21.8.1.0.0.0.194.625.6j1.7.0...0.0...1ac.1.11.youtube.SFRNOMAhbCs) - taught me a lot about form and how to focus on the muscles you want to work. It all sounds like common sense, but it's something I overlooked when I was going through my \"lift as heavy as you can\" phase and often broke form to lift slightly higher weight. Not worth it. \n\n* The progress pics I see posted on this subreddit...seriously, these do so much to motivate me. It sounds immature, but whenever I see a mind-blowing progress photo I stare in awe for a while, then I decide I HAVE to beat it.  It's amazing what some people on here are able to accomplish, and I look up to so many of you.\n\n\n_______\n\n**WHAT I'VE LEARNED**\n\nI've experienced a lot in the past few years.  I have been at extreme lows and am currently at a personal high, so it has been amazing to compare and contrast the mindsets I've experienced.  \n\nI started going to the gym in order to look and feel better.  I didn't know I would get so addicted to it or so passionate about it.  The physical changes my body has gone through truly amaze me, especially having done so in such a short period of time.  What amazes me more though are the mental changes that have resulted from working out.  I feel like a completely different person.  I have confidence, I am proud of myself, and I have learned that I **CAN** dedicate myself to something and stick to it.  I truly believe that what I've learned in the gym will apply to many aspects of my life, such as my schoolwork this year.  (Hey, I can hope...)\n\nA few people that are friends with me get a little annoyed because I talk about fitness so frequently.  What they don't understand is how much more fitness/the gym have to offer than simply getting in shape and looking better.  I go to the gym every day because it allows me to push myself. It allows me to set goals, work hard to achieve them, and then set new goals.  I am very hard on myself. Even having gone through this transformation, I constantly think to myself that I need to be bigger, stronger, leaner, etc.  Maybe that is bad, but maybe it is also a blessing.  I push myself every day, and as a result, have found out what I am capable of.  And it really does amaze me.  I didn't know I could do this, and if you asked me to go to the gym with you 5 months ago, I would have laughed at the idea.  \n\nThis quote speaks to my feels on the gym:\n\n>The Iron never lies to you. You can walk outside and listen to all kinds of talk, get told that you're a god or a total bastard. The Iron will always kick you the real deal. The Iron is the great reference point, the all-knowing perspective giver. Always there like a beacon in the pitch black. I have found the Iron to be my greatest friend. It never freaks out on me, never runs. Friends may come and go. But two hundred pounds is always two hundred pounds.\n\nIt is nice to walk into the gym and know that everything is in my control.  There is no bullshit-- just me, my goals, and a room full of equipment to help me achieve them.  \n\nI'm copying and pasting some things from my last thread regarding what I've learned, because they still hold true.\n\n\n*     Whining about your problems will accomplish nothing. It is up to you to fix yourself.\n*     It is easier to stop thinking about how hard it will be and just do it. It is far harder to live unhappily than it is to do the things necessary to be happy. And the things you do may very well last your life time.\n*     What it means to truly dedicate myself to something and that I CAN do this\n*     What it means to push myself to my limit, and more importantly respect my limits (I read this in a post on /fitness once and will never forget it)\n*     That getting in better shape is directly correlated to confidence and # of girls who smile at you\n\n\n____\n\n**THANKS**\n\nThank you to all of you amazing people out there posting threads, progress photos, information, etc.  It's actually amazing that I've learned so much just from browsing a subreddit.  Many of you have inspired me on my journey and will continue to - I can say with confidence that I wouldn't be where I am today without this subreddit and it's members, so thanks guys.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "My Life Changing 4 Month Transformation / The Best Summer of My Life", "post_ups": 1725, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1lagog/my_life_changing_4_month_transformation_the_best/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:20.017254", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "", "post_created_utc": 1418239042.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1418242614.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2ow3v7", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 756, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1726, "post_selftext": "Pics at bottom\n\n6'5\" tall. Started at 160lbs with an eating disorder and am now 250lbs. Here is my story:\n\nI know that most peoples' stories here are about going from fat to fit, but mine was the other way around. I was always skinny growing up and never particularly athletic. I didn't play sports in high school (but I did karate - bow to your Sensei!). At age 18 in 2007, I joined the Marine Corps a measly 180lbs at 6'5\" and had the ability to do 3 pull ups on a good day.\n\nShortly after arriving at my duty station I became a bit depressed at my situation, feeling out of control of the events of my life since joining the military and being isolated from my home that I had never left before. I began to attempt to gain control of my life by restricting my eating. I counted every calorie, and somehow managed to convince myself that I needed to be leaner. I didn't know this at the time, but I was starting on a path to unhealthy relationships with food and exercise.\n\nIt wasn't long before I found myself eating under 2,000 calories per day and spending hours (literally) on the exercise bike in the gym. 2,000 calories may seem like enough to sustain a person, but definitely not a 6'5 19 year old. This is starvation stuff.\n\nBefore long, I weighed between 155-160 lbs. I began to feel dizzy, weak, irritable and sad a lot of the time. I had 0 interest in friends or pursuing women. All I cared about was food. I kept it from myself and yet wanted it so badly. I binged and purged (through exercise, never puking). I woke up at 3am writhing in pain from starving and binged at an IHOP 45 minutes away. I came back on base and went to the gym and biked for three hours. I went back to my room and had a protein shake and went to sleep. It was about all I could do.\n\n I remember one time being able to taste ammonia in my mouth, which I later read had something to do with the body breaking muscle protein down for food. I was a mess.\n\nThe night before my unit was scheduled to leave for Afghanistan, I randomly found a website listing the symptoms of anorexia and was not so shocked to find that I was experiencing almost all of them. That night, I had an epiphany and realized that I needed to change my habits. I had been reading Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength forum and couldn't wrap my mind around how all of these people just wanted to be strong and not skinny and lean like me. How could they want that? How can all of my friends and co workers be eating food and not worrying about it's nutritional or calorie content? How can they do all of that and yet still outperform me at PT?\n\nAnd then I realized - I am an anorexic.\n\nThat same night, I went to a burger place on base and ordered a cheeseburger, fries and a vanilla shake (to dip the fries in, duh. PS if you don't do this, you need to try it). I sat the food down on my computer desk and told myself that I was going to eat this meal and enjoy it for what it is. It isn't a collection of macronutrients. It isn't a calorie content or a \"cheat meal\". This is dinner. This is what NORMAL people eat for dinner.\n\nThe fitness world is obsessed with being disgusted at the standard American diet. I was too. I judged people HARD for that shit. But that night, I just wanted to be a standard American. I learned a valuable lesson about how extremes are bad, and life is for living. We will all die one day, and I'm not going to be any more righteous on my death bed for having eaten egg whites and veggies my whole life.\n\nShortly after arriving in Afghanistan and going from Helmand to Kandahar province, I found myself with a decent amount of \"free\" time. My job wasn't particularly stressful. I worked in communications with computers on a flight line. I wasn't out patrolling every day. I had time to go to the amazing gym on base, and I committed to Starting Strength. I was done being skinny. I wanted to be a fucking Viking. This was around the same time that 70's Big came online, and I made it my mantra.\n\nI started my squats at 95x3x5. My max bench press was 135lbs. I could Deadlift 185. I got involved in the CrossFit.com forums. I ate my fucking face off.\n\nA funny thing about starvation is that after a long period of it, your brain shuts down the mechanism to make you feel full. It does this as a survival technique to get you to eat to repair the damage of starvation and return to a healthy weight.  I never felt full. I would only know to stop eating because my stomach was so painfully distended. I regularly ate over 3,500 calories per day but tried my best not to count it.\n\nI was so lucky to have a cushy job and be somewhere that I could eat and train like I wanted.. A lot of my brothers and sisters weren't so lucky, and those brave men and women had a much rougher experience in Afghan than I did.\n\nWhen I got back, I weighed 190-200lbs and was much stronger, but still had so far to go.\n\nThrough transitioning from Starting Strength to a bodybuilding program, I was able to reach 225lbs bodyweight.\n\nJust before leaving the military, I got my CrossFit level 1 trainer certification and spent some time training at the CrossFit on base, which was a parking lot with a shipping container full of equipment.\n\nWhen I got out of the Marines, I landed a personal training job back here in San Diego with just my CrossFit Certification, and began training clients in a regular gym setting while going downtown to do CrossFit myself at CrossFit San Diego.\n\nFrom there, I ended up on a CrossFit team here that made it to the SoCal Regional competition where I competed. I think we placed 14th overall out of the top 30 teams who qualified in the first place.\n\nI no longer have an unhealthy, obsessive relationship with food, my gains in performance and aesthetics have never been better. I eat mostly whatever I want, just try to get enough calories in. If I don't feel like training or I have to skip it to hang out with friends or because I'm hung over, so be it. I don't get anxiety about it any more. Drop in the ocean.\n\nI'm still a personal trainer and still on my fitness journey! I recently weighed in at 250lbs and have done powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting competitions as well as CrossFit ones. I've worked at a CrossFit gym which was an awesome experience, but am no longer really active in that community.\n\nTL;DR - Was a skinny weakling, now i'm not\n\nPS If anybody in the San Diego area wants to train with me, let me know!  I love working out with a partner!\n\nMy current best lifts are:\n\nSquat - 465lb (high bar Olympic style, full depth)\n\nDeadlift - 530lb (did this the other day with no chalk or belt, think I have more in me)\n\nBench Press - 360lb\n\nSnatch - 270lb\n\nClean and Jerk - 345lb\n\nPush press - 300lb\n\nOverhead squat - 315lb\n\nBEFORE:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a3Pa6B3\n\nhttp://imgur.com/1IoXLmA\n\nAFTER:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/15pPa", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "From skinny to fit - my transformation from 160lb to 250lb also AMA and who wants to lift in San Diego?", "post_ups": 1726, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2ow3v7/from_skinny_to_fit_my_transformation_from_160lb/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:20.017254", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "bankerman", "post_created_utc": 1462972057.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "4iut80", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 1973, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1727, "post_selftext": "Couple weeks back someone mentioned that mixing fiber powder into a tall glass of water and waiting 15 minutes was like a cheat code for cutting.

It\u2019s been a massive help & really helped me in my journey. Although this is 5 year progress I didn't start lifting & taking fitness seriously until the beginning of 2017 when I stumbled across r/fitness.\n\nAlthough I have a long way to go I feel that at almost 40 I am in better shape now then I was back in my 20's!\n\n**Background**\n\nI Separated from my ex in 2013. Weighed 195lb, smoked & drank way too much. Office job & very unfit. Decided I needed to make a change. Initially started doing the Insanity workouts in my living room then progressed to cycling. Started with a low carb diet then just simply watching what I was eating. From 2013 to 2016 I was yo-yo dieting & hovered around 152lb until I finally quit drinking & started counting calories seriously. Dropped to a very low weight of 118lb by the end of 2016. I eventually joined a gym at the end of 2016. Started to lift free weights in February 2017.\n\n**Lift Progress 5RM**\n\n|Date|September 2013|February 2017|April 2018|November 2018|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Weight|195lb|118lb|174lb|132lb|\n|Squat|\\-|45lb|200lb|180lb|\n|Bench|\\-|45lb|170lb|160lb|\n|Deadlift|\\-|110lb|300lb|270lb|\n|OHP|\\-|45lb|115lb|110lb|\n\n**Exercises**\n\nSquat - Really found this exercise hard to master. Started with low bar, then high bar & now back to low bar.\n\nBench Press - This was probably one of the easiest exercise to learn.\n\nDeadlift - Another tricky exercise to learn. Had some real problems keeping my lower back from rounding. I have swapped to trap bar deadlifts recently as I find it easier on my back.\n\nOverhead Press - I tried progressing on this lift too quick when I started & ended up hurting my shoulder. I swapped for seated smith OHP a while back & find it a lot more easy on my shoulders.\n\nOther exercises -\n\n**Stats and Pictures**\n\n|Date|September 2013|January 2016|April 2018|November 2018|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Weight|195lb|152lb|174lb|132lb|\n|Front|[Pic 1](https://imgur.com/ltLZecA) & [Pic 2](https://imgur.com/obNUqlr)|[Pic 1](https://imgur.com/bihzHTB)|[Pic 1](https://imgur.com/ZIJ95Ot)|[Pic 1](https://imgur.com/G7IGyAo) & [Pic 2](https://imgur.com/vtKaEbH)|\n|Side|\\-|\\-|[Pic 1](https://imgur.com/L4eUY3w)|[Pic 1](https://imgur.com/yiUQvYn)|\n|Back|\\-|\\-|[Pic 1](https://imgur.com/mMKbDrj)|[Pic 1](https://imgur.com/aUp0bY1)|\n\nComparison pic:  [Comparison Pic](https://imgur.com/C6tWot1)\n\n**Training**\n\n2013 to 2016 - Insanity DVD & cycling\n\n2017 to 2018 - Started following a 3 day full body routine called Fierce 5. After around 3 months I wanted to get into the gym more so I switched to the PHAT routine which I absolutely loved. Followed this for 6 months & I shoved loads of food down my throat. I basically dirty bulked until I realised I had put on a massive amount of fat on. From April 2018 I switched to the Reddit PPL which can be found in the side bar & it's a fantastic routine. I followed this throughout my cut. My lifts dropped a bit which I expected on a cut. But, relative to my current bodyweight my lifts have not suffered much & I am hoping that I can get these back up now I have started eating at maintenance.\n\n**Tips**\n\nDon't forget to warm up & stretch. Spend the first 10 to 20 mins warming up before you dive into lifting. Forget what other people are lifting & how big they are, they have more than likely been lifting years.  Ask people if you need help or advice, most people in the gym enjoy helping. Pick a routine that matches your goals & above all else pick one that you enjoy. There's no point doing a routine that you cant stand as you will not be consistent & will more than likely half ass it.\n\n**Diet**\n\nI have a very small frame & my TDEE is very low. This caused a problem when bulking because it was just so easy to over eat.\n\nBulking Calories - 2300.\n\nCutting Calories - 1400.\n\nMacro split - 35/35/30% C/P/F.\n\nSupplements used - BCAA, creatine monohydrate.\n\nDrinks - 3 cups of coffee per day. Probably 3 drinks of alcohol per year.\n\nSnacks - I have been having a carb reefed once per week during my cut eating a lot of cereal & my favourite pancakes with peanut butter a jam........mmmmmmmmm I can feel one coming on right now!\n\nTypical days eating during my cut would be:\n\nBreakfast - Protein shake.\n\nLunch - Brown sandwich with 100g sliced ham.\n\nDinner - 140g Chicken breast with steamed veg.\n\nSupper - 40g Peanut butter, 1 apple.\n\nPre workout snack - 250g Greek Yoghurt with 35g oats, banana.\n\nMy bulking days would be similar but i would add some oats with breakfast, double my lunch sandwich & add a protein shake post workout.\n\n**Do's & Dont's**\n\nDo's\n\n* Weigh & count everything that passes your lips including sauces & other little things that you may not consider but they do make a difference. Get yourself a good electronic food scale & use an app like My Fitness Pal.\n* Whether your bulking or cutting make sure you weigh yourself at the same time each week after the toilet. I use a great app called Libra that lets you enter your weight & it gives you an average over the week / month.\n* Do include at least some cardio just for cardiac health. Your blood pressure & heart rate will thank you for it. Plus you will feel more energetic to lift. Just don't over do it.\n* Do drink plenty of water & limit alcohol intake\n* Do concentrate on your compound lifts, Bench, squat, deadlift, OHP. Give all your energy & effort to these & make sure they are first in what ever routine you try.\n* Do pick a routine from the side bar & not try to make your own.\n\nDont's\n\n* Don't yo-yo diet. Pick cut / bulk / maintain & stick with it for at least 3 months.\n* Don't stop eating the things you enjoy. If they fit within your calorie allowance its fine. Even if they dont, dont deny yourself. The odd piece of cake will make little difference in the grand scheme of things & will keep you motivated.\n* Don't think the more you eat the more muscle you will add. You can only add a certain amount of muscle per year. There's a lot of different opinions of this but my research suggests from the bottom end of around 10lb per year to around 20lb. This is for beginners & is dependant on diet / rest / routine.\n* Don't be sacred of cutting. Keep protein high & the weight on the bar as high as possible & you will lose very little muscle if any.\n* Don't be scared of a fluctuation in scale weight. You can add 2lb to 3lb over night with an increase in carbs. This will stabilize over the week.\n\n**Going forward**\n\nI am going to maintain for a couple of weeks then start a slow lean bulk with a surplus of around 200 to 300. I want to concentrate on increasing my compound lifts so I may drop the accessories a little. I'm also considering adding 5/3/1 BBB progression to PPL or may even switch to 4 day 5/3/1 BBB for a while & add 2 days of conditioning. My goal for the next 2 years is to add 10lb of muscle per year. I would love to be a lean 150lb.\n\nThanks for reading & I hope someone might get some use from this post.\n\n**Edit:** Thank you so much for all the kind, wonderful & inspiring comments.

I'm chasing that 700 pound deadlift & I'm taking every amped up opportunity to try again and again.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is my first ever meet in sleeves, not knee wraps, so my squat was meh but I'm most proud of my deadlift PR as a result of new programming. \n\nEnded up with:\n\nSquat 485lbs\n\nBench 319lbs\n\nDeadlift 622lb\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReally excited that I had more in the tank after the deadlift PR too, shooting for 640 to 650 in November!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI was going to train for the Worlds Strongest Disabled Man but I found out that I am pretty much not disabled enough, which is a little frustrating but it's all right because it actually got me thinking about starting my own adaptive competition but more on that later. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere's the last 4 weeks of the program I followed to get these numbers and only eight weeks of prep right after my 4th meet:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSquat 5x3 @ 80% /4x2 @85%/ 3x2 @90%/ reload\n\nDeadlift 5x1 @50%\n\nBulgarian split squats 3x15\n\nHam curls 4x10\n\nPull ups 4x AMRAP\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBench 5x3 @ 80% /4x2 @85%/ 3x2 @90%/ deload \n\nIncline hammer strength press 3x12\n\nLateral raises 3x14\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDeadlift 5x3 @ 80% /4x2 @85%/ 3x2 @90%/ deload \n\nSquat 5x1 @50%\n\nRow of choice 3x12\n\nBicep/triceps of choice\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDeload every three weeks at 50% with same exercise volume (until 2 weeks out then cut volume in half) Deloading frequently has helped me hit bigger numbers in the long run but sucks mentally for that week. \n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'll be prepping for a meet in September but I'm trying to increase my work capacity this time with higher rep ranges to improve my squat which has been pretty stagnate. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSide note:  The bleeding has stopped from deadlifting too - I guess the scar tissue has built up enough! Recently the biggest issue has been the diabetes and frequent lows during the gym but I'm working on it! \n\nSide side note: To the people who say I can't call myself one handed, it was verified that I indeed do NOT have a hand.

I'd had a terrible year the year before, where I had gained around 15kg, and my health was suffering. I was physically ruined, felt bad about my body, and wanted to regain the former athleticism of my teenage years.\n\nIt has been 9 months, and I've made noticeable but not ridiculous gains. I would like to share my progress with you.\n\n**BASIC INFO:**\n\nI am 5'10\", or 178cm \nStarting weight: 86kg/190lbs \nFinal weight: 75kg/165lbs\n\n**Progress Pictures:**\n\nCurrent: [14th December 2017](https://imgur.com/VL8ATqR)\n\nBefore: [18th April 2017](https://imgur.com/8uLcYDQ)\n\nMiddle: [15th July 2017](https://imgur.com/uRr3znB)\n\nCurrent best sets for each lift: \n\nBench: 90kg (200lbs) for 2 \n\nOHP: 62.5kg (137.5lbs) for 2 \n\nDeadlift: 157.5kg (347.5lbs) for 4 \n\nSquat: 125kg (275lbs) for 3\n\nWhile not strictly taken straight from the couch, as I had already lost around 4kg when it was taken, the before pic gives you a good idea of where I was at to start off. The current pic was taken yesterday.\n\nAll 3 were taken in 3 different bathrooms with different lighting, so it's not a perfect comparison, but it gives you the gist of it.\n\n**NUTRITION:** \n\nThe first thing I did after browsing a few forums was download MyFitnessPal. I estimated my TDEE at around 2800, and set my macros to 2200 calories a day, with 220g carbs, 165g protein, and 73g fat.\n\nWhile I, like nobody, was perfect, I worked really hard on my nutrition, and was within a hundred or so calories and 15g or so of protein virtually every day for the first 6 months.\n\nFor breakfast, I either ate oats, or omelettes with ham and cheese, full cream milk, and rye bread.\nFor lunch I'd have a smoothie with a banana or some berries, 100g of greek yoghurt, a scoop of whey protein, some honey, and full cream milk again.\n\nUsually for dinner I'd have whatever we were having at the house, (pasta, fish, steak, chicken stir fry, etc) and if I needed to top up to meet my goals at the end of the day, I would have a small shake, but usually that wasn't necessary.\n\nI never snacked, ever.\n\nI have basically kept these macros until this day. I stopped losing weight around 4 months in when I reached my goal weight of 75kg, but since it's Australian summer, I'm not too desperate to bulk just yet. A recomp has been going fine, and my habits are so ingrained that I find it hard to deviate.\n\n**LIFTING:** \n\nI actually started with StrongLifts 5x5, but after about 4 weeks, I had learned the lifts, and was beginning to stall. I injured my knee in a game of football and did some upper body fuckaroundosis for about 4 more weeks. Once my knee was better, I was looking for a program, and I came across a great one over at r/nsuns.\n\nI started on the 5 day version, but since my squat fell behind due to a the knee, I transitioned to 6 day squat to catch it up, and have been doing that version since. I have de-loaded three times, each time with great results in the cycle immediately after. I love the program, it's amazing for the big lifts and gives me plenty of room to fit in accessories and some cardio.\n\nA few things I learned along the way were seemingly obvious now. Leave your ego at the door. Everything takes time. Get enough sleep.\n\nUltimately though my biggest takeaway was that every time I came up against an obstacle, the best way to get past it was to keep healthy and keep lifting.\n\nMy deadlift struggled off the floor, so I ate right, watched my form videos, and kept deadlifting. It got better.\nMy bench stalled for 4 weeks, so I ate right, I de-loaded, and benched more. It got better.\nMy OHP struggled at lockout, so I ate right, did some tricep accessories, and pressed more. It got better.\n\nUnless I am feeling pain, I usually know that the best way to get past any kind of struggle in lifting is to trust the process. I check my form, hit my macros, embrace the grind, and get stronger. I have loved that part of the experience of lifting and it has been great for my confidence to overcome obstacles this way. I really appreciate everything I've learned on r/fitness over the last 9 months, as this is only the start of a lifelong journey in fitness that i'm incredibly relieved I started so young.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\nWhen I first lost weight, I noticed I could sleep better, and get out of bed more easily.\n\nOne thing that really scared me was that I noticed when lying down once, having lost about 10kg, that my heart was beating noticeably slower. These habits matter, and they affect our health long term. The past nine months was a real wake up call, and I'm grateful for forums like this where we can share information and inspiration to make a change in our lives.\n\nLike I said, this is only the start. I hope anyone who is new can see the kind of difference you can make if you just get started!

Had some dumbells and a bench press that maxed out at 150lbs. Wasn't on a program would just do youtube at home workouts for my legs and make my dad spot me until I failed. After a while I grew out of that and joined a gym. Got on my first 5/3/1 program here, did this for about 6 months I'd say, this is where most of my linear progression happened.\n\n\n **Monday, light bench day and light OHP day**\n\n* Bench:  sets of 8, 6, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6 ,7 ,8+ \n+ OHP sets of 6, 5, 3, 5, 7, 4, 6, 8 \n- followed by a chest, arms and back accessory lift\n\n**Tuesday Heavy squats and sumos day**\n\n* Squat: sets of 5, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5+ \n+ Sumo DL: sets of 5, 5, 3, 5, 7, 4, 6, 8\n- followed by a back, legs and abs accessory lift\n\n**Wednesday heavy OHP day**\n\n* OHP: sets of 5, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5+\n+ Incline Bench: sets of 6, 5, 3, 5, 7, 4, 6, 8\n- Followed by a shoulder, chest and arm accessory lift\n\n**Thursday Deadlift and light squat day**\n\n* Deadlift: sets of 5, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3+\n+ Squats: Sets of 5, 5, 3, 5, 7, 4, 6, 8\n- Followed by a back, leg and ab accessory lift\n\n**Friday Heavy bench day**\n\n* Bench: sets of 5, 3, 1, 3, 5, 3, 5, 3, 5+\n+ CG Bench: sets of 6, 5, 3, 5, 7, 4, 6, 8\n- Followed by a chest, shoulders and arms accessory lift\n\n\nSo a typical Friday when I was progressing would look like this, the number is weight in pounds on one side of the bar, if you failed on the single set you would drop the total weight down for everything by 5 pounds for the next week. If you succeeded you would go up 5 pounds for the next week.\n\n * Bench 47.5 x 5, 55 x 3, 65 x 1, 60 x 3, 55 x 5, 52.5 x 3, 47.5 x 5, 42.5 x 3, 37.5 x 5+\n * CG Bench 15 x 6, 25 x 5, 32.5 x 3, 32.5 x 5, 32.5 x 7, 32.5 x 4, 32.5 x 6, 32.5 x 8\n * dumbbell press 3 x 10-12 with whatever I wasn't struggling with.\n * curls 3 x 10-12 with whatever I wasn't struggling with.\n * upright barbell row 3 x 10-12 with whatever I wasn't struggling with.\n\nDiet: Tons of whole milk and GNC 1340 bulk protein. Would fill my shaker bottle to the brim every single day. I would meal prep by making a big ass dish of breaded baked chicken, veggies and rice. I would portion that out for 5 days. I would roughly count calories and always shoot for 2500+. It gets old eating the same thing but sriracha or hot sauce helps. In addition to that lots of fruit, eggs, oatmeal, sushi. Weekends I'd eat out most of the time and stuff my face with whatever.\n\n**PRs**\n\n* OHP: 135lbs x 1\n* Bench: 225lbs x 3 \n* Squat: 245lbs x 1\n* DL: 260lbs x 1 (shit)\n\nOverall I am really happy with my progression. I'm sure I could get a lot further but I'm on a different program now just to maintain as I have a torn labrum in my shoulder, pretty bad pain in my left knee and right hip. If I ever get around to seeing doctors and possible surgery to fix all these issues with my joints I may push myself more but for now they hold me back.\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Have been lifting for 1.5 years.

I'm also on an every other day split for cardio (Running/Swimming).\n\n\n*A sample week would look something like this*\n\nMonday: Push/Run\n\nTuesday: Pull/Swim\n\nWednesday: Legs/Run\n\nThursday: Push/Swim\n\nFriday: Pull/Run\n\nSaturday: Legs/Swim\n\nSunday: Rest (Even though it's technically a rest I still will get some exercise in either hiking or just going for a walk.)\n\n\n**Lifting:**\n\nEach day goes, PST training then power lifts then body building I'm in the gym for roughly 3 hours every day so this probably isn't an ideal split for people with a full time job or any resemblance of a life.\n\n**Push Days**: I start each push day with 10 sets of 30 push ups and then 4 sets of 10 dips . Next I get my power lift out of the way. For push days it's obviously bench press. I do 5x5 with the most weight I can possibly do for 5 reps starting on set one, Which is currently 185lbs. I'm not a fan of progressive overload and think that your last rep on every set should be impossible and then you do it anyways. So then next set i'll take 2.5lbs off and do 182.5 for 5 reps after a 2-3 minute rest, repeating this pattern for all 5 sets. However if I get the 5th rep on a set without almost dying I will do that weight again for however many sets until I almost die.\n\nNext I go into my body building lifts. The key here is that I do 3-4 lifts per body part doing 4x8 for each lift with about 45 seconds between each set.\n\n*Chest*: Incline bench/Incline dumbbell press/weighted dips/chest flys machine or cable.\n\n*Triceps*: Rope pull downs/Parallel rope pulls/reverse grip pulldowns with a flat bar/skullcrushers/weighted bench dips.\n\n*Front Delts*: A lot of the chest exercises hit front delts so I usually only do 2 lifts to hit these. Shoulder press either Machine/Barbell/Dumbbell and lateral front raises with a 45 lb plate or Upright Rows.\n\n\n**Pull days**: pull ups. 5 sets to exhaustion each one.\n\npower lift: Deadlift 5x5 in the same fashion as bench\n\nBodybuilding lifts(4x8):\n\n*Lats*: Pull ups/Lat pull downs\n\n*Biceps*: Preacher curls/ Reverse Curls/ Dumbbell Curls (focusing on hypertrophy)/ Cable Curls/ Weighted Chin Ups\n\n*Lateral Delts*: Lateral Dumbbell raise/ Lateral Cable Pulls\n\n*Back Delts*: Dumbbell Rear Delt Raise/ Face Pulls/Machine Back Delt Flys\n\n*Traps*: Bent Over Barbell Row/Single Arm Dumbbell Upright Row/Dumbbell Shrugs/Barbell Shrugs(In the squat rack because i'm a douche).\n\n*Lower back*: Romanian Deadlift/Weighted Back Extensions\n\n\n**Leg Day**: Don't have any PST related exercises on leg days but I make sure to run or swim before I lift as opposed to after. \n\npower Lift: Squat 5x5 same fashion as bench press.\n\nBody building lifts(4x8):\nHack Squats/Leg Press/Leg Curls/Reverse Leg Curls/Calf Press/Glute Press/Box Calf Raises on smith machine/Split Squats/The two weird leg spreading machines that you don't want to make eye contact with anyone while doing.\n\n**Cardio**: Running days I train speed and endurance every other day so day one I will run up to 8 miles at a light enough pace to where i could hold a conversation. day two I run 1.5-3 miles as fast as I possibly can, occasionally I will do a hybrid day where I run 4 miles as fast as I can but only rarely.\n\n\n**Swimming**: I only swim using the combat sidestroke. And same thing as running. Day one I train endurance and will swim 1500-3000 Yards at a comfortable pace. Day Two: I swim 500-1000 yards as fast as possible.\n\n\n**Diet**:\nNot going super into detail but my day looks something like this.\n\n4:30 am Breakfast 1: High carbs (Oatmeal/Toast etc)\n\n5 am Workout\n\n8 am Breakfast 2: High Protein (Eggs/Greek Yogurt/Turkey Bacon etc)\n\n9 am Cardio\n\n10-10:30 am Snack: Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwiches \n\n12 pm Lunch: Chicken/Turkey or Red Meat with 2 sides a vegetable and a carb\n\n2 pm Mass gainer shake\n\n4 pm snack: most likely more peanut butter and jelly sandwiches\n\n6 pm  Dinner: Chicken/Turkey or Red Meat with 2 sides a vegetable and a carb\n\n8 pm mass gainer shake\n\n8:15 pm bed\n\n\nI eat around 4500 calories a day but I don't count them anymore.\n\n\n**Supplements**: \n\nMulti Vitamins\n\nMusclePharm Creatine Monohydrate (5g/daily)\n\nMusclePharm Fish Oil\n\nO.N. Gold Standard Whey (I go through a metric fuck ton of this stuff as I take one scoop every hour while lifting \nand then also in my mass gainer shakes).\n\nMr Hyde Preworkout (This stuff is toxic only take it if you have a high caffeine tolerance and aren't afraid of possibly having a heart attack the first couple times)\n\nMusclePharm Amino 1 (post workout)\n\n\n**Couple of side thoughts**: \n\nI have bad genetics for my biceps and traps that's why they are so pathetic :/\n\nMy workout regiment isn't optimal as i'm in a bulk while also training a ton of cardio but due to my goals this is the way it has to be.\n\nI'm willing to go more into detail about anything, just shoot me a PM.\n\n**TL:DR** Hated life, Decided to join the Navy, Bulked up from 116 to 165 lbs and literally lifted myself out of depression.\n\nEdit: Figured I'd throw this in as lots of people have mentioned it. I'm switching to 4 days a week of Bodyweight/HIIT training starting june and leaving only 2 days of body building/power lifting a week.\n\nEdit 2: Really didn't think i'd be accused of using gear lol, it's pretty much the best compliment I can be given. But I was 5'11 and 116 lbs when I started lifting and eating right. With beginner gains I bulked up my first 30 lbs in 4-6 weeks and 20lbs in the following 3 months. Also with taking creatine I almost instantly gained 8lbs from water weight. I have also gone from 6% body fat to 11% body fat. While I also agree that putting on 50 lbs of muscle in 4 months is impossible without gear. Realistically I have put on like 30 lbs of actual muscle in 4 months and I was severely underweight to begin with.

I'm an obese guy, but the last four days in a row I have been walking at a fast pace (a big deal for me) and lightly jogging along a neat, secluded nature trail by my university. Nobody can see me--aka judge me--so I feel completely at ease, and the second I had the idea to start jogging down the path...I started to smile. I was going faster than I have in years, sweeping past all of the trees and hearing the birds in the distance, hopping over a few stray sticks. I was happy that I was actually using my body! After I got winded (20 seconds or so) I paused and just looked around at the trees around me and something clicked inside me...that I have been missing this particular joy in my life for the longest time. I have been at that nature trail (right by my apartment) every day now for four days in a row doing the same thing!\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to say that for those of you veteran fitness buffs...when you have those rough days when you don't feel like getting up and being active, always remember that it's a privilege every single day that you have the ability to be in motion!

I had enough of making excuses for my weight, making excuses for my diet and making excuses for my fucking fitness. Holding your breathe when you tie your shoe laces isn't normal. Struggling to wipe your own ass isn't normal. Saying \"no\" to social functions because of the walking involved and the lack of seating **ISN'T. FUCKING. NORMAL**.\n\nI told myself I would make a change, so I started scouring reddit, collecting all the information I could so that I could become something close to a human again. I had a plan, but this plan seemed scary. I was chocked full of fatlogic, but I was quickly able to break past all of the bullshit and get the damn job done. \n\n**Diet**\n\nI knew that this had to be done correctly as calorie control is the majority of the battle. My plan was a 2000 calorie diet (I've since reduced it down to 1800), which consists of a balance of food. No food was off limits, but moderation was key. I also phased out beer from my diet and replaced it with water. This change was tough, but with the amount I was drinking, it was important. I would normally eat 2 meals a day, once at lunch and once at dinner. My dinner always consisted of a piece of meat along with a side of vegetables and a side of what ever carb I chose (chips, mashed potato, pasta salads were among my favourites). \n\n\n**Exercise**\n\nInitially, I didn't plan exercise. My first focus was getting my diet in order. But a funny thing happened... Within the first week of eating correct portions, I started sleeping better. Which gave me more energy, which made me want to exercise. Ironically, knee injuries run in my family. So I decided to start slow. 45 minutes of walking laps around the oval behind my house should do it. I started doing that everyday, after a while I would get restless until I went out and did my fast walking. I also added a new rule for myself, if there is an escalator/elevator with a set of stairs available, I **have to** take the stairs. (Nowadays this rule has evolved that I need to take said stairs 2 steps at a time :D)\n\nAfter a month or so of doing this, it started to get cold as fuck in Australia. I decided it was about time to migrate to the gym for my workouts. This is where I started to really step up my efforts. After buying a Fitbit Charge HR, I continued my daily walks. As the weight continued to melt off, I started testing myself. Lets put 30 seconds of jogging in towards the end of my walk. Why not add a 30 second bout earlier on in my walk. As time went on, those two 30 second jogs became 1 minute, then 2 minute, then 5 minutes, and so on until before I knew it I was running for 30 minutes solid. I ended up running my first 5k back in August and now I cannot go a week without going for a run.\n\nThe 5k I ran indicated to me that I needed to implement some resistance training, so I reduced my cardio workouts to 2-4 runs per week, normally on the weekends and I started working with body weight training. I'm somewhat ashamed to admit that at 27 years old, I'd never done a push up. Ever. That was one of my goals. So I started with some basic exercises. Squats, lunges, rows, bicep curls, planks and of course - push ups. /r/bodyweightfitness recommended a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dF1DOWzf20) to help with push up progression. So I started with wall push ups. Then I moved to incline push ups, then I moved to negative push ups. That's where I am right now. I'm on the precipice of doing proper form push ups. I'm forever pushing myself, I have access to a chin up bar and once I lose a bit more weight (and nail my first pushup), I'll be putting my effort into chin ups and pull ups :D\n\n\nSo there you have it after 8 months and 71 lbs, I'm well on my way to being a new man. I want to thank /r/fitness for being awesome, you guys are inspirations and I would like to give a shameless plug to /r/loseit, /r/progresspics and /r/bodyweightfitness. Without these subs, I'm not sure where I would be right now.\n\n[Here are some progress pictures, I also added a print out from a doctors visit today. According to my GP, I've pretty much reduced my threat of a premature death to nothing. Doesn't mean I'm done just yet though :D](https://imgur.com/gallery/XVoKy/new)\n\n**Edit: Holy hell, I just got up from a sleep and this kinda blew up.

This is my first post here in fitness, and I don't use imgur much, so hopefully this works.\n\nI don't often brag about my weight loss, because, well, while it is a great achievement that people have told me they have felt inspired by, there is still a great deal I am self conscious about. I am currently weighing in at 240, down from 385. I'm 6'2', and my genetics have provided me with a very large frame of a body. Here's the best before picture I could find, which is me at my heaviest:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/VX8Ck#1\n\nI have never been more proud of myself. While I have been running for a while now, I have never tackled that half marathon  distance (21.1km) casually. I've come close, but never that far. This was the Vancouver Scotiabank Half Marathon race on June 28th. Here is a picture of myself, and my best friend at the finish line:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/VX8Ck#0\n\nI would never have even laced up a pair of running shoes if it wasn't for that girl. I ran this race with a slightly enflammed planter fascia, and two hours of sleep. She had a fever, two hours of sleep, and a stomach flu, and she toughed it out with me because she knew how important it was to me to run that race with her. She has been a runner for a long time, and even competitive when she was in high school and university, and I owe her so much for being the most supportive and incredible friend I could ever ask for.\n\nWhile my weight loss has occurred sporatically over the course of a couple years, I could never have imagined at the start of it all, when I looked in the mirror and saw the mess that I did, that I would EVER be running across a half marathon finish line with her hand in mine like that.\n\nI just hope my short, yet sweet story can inspire some of you to achieve goals you don't think are possible.\n\nBecause let me tell you something, they are.\n\nEDIT: I love you guys, thank you so much for your kind words. It's because of supportive people like you that I've been able to keep trucking along and accomplish these things. Someone mentioned I should add how I did it, in order to maintain this post in fitness. So here's a quick rundown:\n\nWhen I first started losing weight, I wasn't even able to exercise. There was far too much pain, for THREE months, I ate and drank the EXACT same thing.\n\nBreakfast - 2 egg omlette with half a white onion, and 1/4 large tomato, and 1 fast fry steak\nLunch - A huge tuna salad with varying degrees of vegetables - always oil and vinegar for dressing. Ocassionally swapping in a raspberry vinagerette\nDinner - Steak or Chicken stir fry with different veggies. Zuccinni, peppers, mushrooms, etc. I would use things like limes, lemon, cilantro, cracked pepper, etc for flavour and avoid all heavy sauces\n\nAs soon as I was able to exercise I started easy. Running laps around a field near my house. Rollerblading around parks, etc, I started to introduce fruit into my diet in order to gain some energy required for these exercises. Once I dropped weight even further, probably within 5 months, I introduced some heavier carbs again. Pasta, was a go to dish.\n\nThe muscular look you guys see, is because I started seeing a personal trainer last year as well, and she really helped me bulk up and get some strength. At my absolute LOWEST, I was around 220lbs, but put on muscle and bulked back up a little to 240.\n\nEDIT #2\n\nI found a better before picture...\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4KDjtbL.jpg\n\nEDIT #3\n\nJust because I seem to have to respond to the various comments about romance... she is married to a good friend of mine. Her and I have been friends for 12 years.\n\nEDIT #4 \n\nA few people asked.

Long time lurker here but never posted until now. Today marks the end of my first year of going to the gym and since nobody really cares in my family i decided to share it with all of you! \n\nFirst off a little bit about me: I'm a 21 year old guy, 6 feet tall and now currently 176lbs (80kg). It wasn't always like this though. Last year i struggled with being heavily underweight, borderline anorexic. I was all but skin and bones and i didn't like it but i was too lazy to do anything about it. Until one night i \"really\" looked in the mirror, like it's hard to explain but something just clicked. I finally realized something had to change or i was going to slowly kill myself and join the skeleton war sooner than later.\n\nThe very next day i joined my local gym and instantly took a year long membership. I was pretty proud of myself for finally taking the step and told my friends and family but instead of supporting me they laughed and ridiculed me. Telling me how i wouldn't make it at all. It hurt a lot more than i'm willing to admit, but i promised myself to prove them wrong. \n\nThe beginning was very hard. It was intimidating to see all these huge guys judging my every move(even though now i know they didn't). I got a standard full body workout for 3 months from one of the employees that works there. I can't describe how pathetic i felt when i couldn't even lift the barbell of the benching rack, or when i was struggling with my last set of 8 pound(4 kg) dumbbell curls. \n\nBut i kept on going, for 3 days a week i dragged myself to the gym against my will because quite frankly it sucked. It sucked real hard. But after 2 months i saw my first beginner gains and that was the only motivation i needed. Every time i went, i increased my weights and it felt great. I quit drinking any kind of soda or fast food and only drank water and healthy food. It was hard to get rid of the sugar addiction but i felt so much better and alive than i ever had. Time moved so fast and before i knew it my first year had ended. I feel great and try and motivate as many people around me to start working out, making schedules for them and showing them the ropes and techniques that were so difficult for me to learn.\n\nIn the end the only one who stops you from going to the gym is you.\n\nThanks for listening to me, it feels like such a weight of my shoulders!\n\nI'll post my progress on the \"big 3\" quickly,just because :)\n\nStart: \n\n-Bench: Barbell+no weight=22lbs (10kg)\n-Squat: 66lbs (40kg)\n-Deadlift: 66lbs (40kg)\n\nThese were 5x5 reps\n\nEnd:\n\nBench: 200 lbs (92kg\nSquat: 242lbs (110kg)\nDeadlift: 308lbs (140kg)\n\nEdit: Alot of people ask me about my diet but alas i don't really use one. What i did to gain weight was: \n\nEat the right foods, and eat as often and as much as i can. I ate till i gagged and then some more, right on the edge of throwing up i stopped. It may be a bit extreme but it's the only way i gained weight.\n\nA normal day for me: wake up: drink a protein shake, with oatmeal and some fruit. A few hours later i'll eat greek yoghurt with frozen raspberries. Around noon i'll just eat sandwiches with cheese and ham, maybe some tuna or peanut butter. Then my snacks till the evening are about the same as the morning+ another protein shake. Then i eat whatever my mother cooks me which is mostly chicken,fish or meat with another protein shake. that's about it Don't forget to eat all sorts of nuts! Just googling \"Food for weight gains\" will give you a wide variety of food to eat\n\nPS: English isn't my native language so excuse my grammar \nPPS: Alot of you are asking for Before/After pics but one of my biggest regrets is that i dont have a before pic, i didn't like how i looked and i deff didn't want to have a picture of it. But after a quick google search i found this: http://static.learning-english-online.net/img/physical-appearance/underweight.jpg\n\nWhich is basicly exacly how i looked.\n\nAfter pics are these: http://imgur.com/a/K7k2J\n\nNot exacly breathtaking but i'm pretty proud.

This is an important topic to me. I remember being younger and thinking I was fat despite being [having my body fat measured at 7% at my colleges department of health and nutrition](http://i.imgur.com/Ifhhiaf.jpg). I felt like this because I had softness in my belly, and my stomach folded when I sat down, unlike the unrealistic pictures I would see in men's health magazines and on TV and Movies. In one of the other threads, I posted an album of pictures that many users told me they found helpful. I'd like to start a blog using similar pictures with the intent of helping people unlearn the unrealistic expectations of their body that they've learned from the media. My idea is for people to send in images of their body, some where they try to look as fit as possible (good lighting, flexing, etc) and some where they just look natural (sitting, relaxed, etc) so that people can see that healthy bodies can look very different, and that even the same body can look drastically different under different conditions. If this sounds interesting to anyone, please let me know, or if you have any advice or input please tell me.\n\nHere's the album I just made\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/7mbls\n\nIf you would like to contribute (either to this thread or to the potential blog) feel free to add your own albums.\n\n**Edit 3:** By request, I've added [new pictures via a second album](http://imgur.com/a/8X2FQ). This should help compare the pose vs lighting.\n\n**Edit:** Just to be clear, I think everyone should be constantly trying to improve themselves everyday, whether it be physically, mentally, or emotionally. I don't intend to discourage people from improving their body, instead my goal is to help people understand what is a reasonable rubric to compare themselves to. This is mainly to combat [unrealistic representations of fit bodies in the media](http://www.thestarphoenix.com/bridges/cms/binary/6431443.jpg?size=620x400).\n\n**Edit 2:** This got popular, so I want to take this chance to expose people to some other really great information on the topic:\n\n[Lauren Fleshman photo shoot vs average day](http://asklaurenfleshman.com/2013/11/keeping-it-real/)\n\n[Before and after photos debunked (youtube video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M957dACQyfU)\n\n[Physique of various athletes](http://www.boredpanda.com/athlete-body-types-comparison-howard-schatz/)\n\n[Molly Galbraith love your body](http://mollygalbraith.com/2014/03/cellulite-stretch-marks-and-a-love-your-body-challenge/)\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "On body image and healthy expectations", "post_ups": 1704, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2pd1ap/on_body_image_and_healthy_expectations/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:20.018388", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "BroBroo", "post_created_utc": 1391307872.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "1wrx2a", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 121, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1697, "post_selftext": "my dad asked ME to open the pickle jar today.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Well/r/fitness working out finally paid off today...", "post_ups": 1697, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1wrx2a/wellrfitness_working_out_finally_paid_off_today/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:20.018388", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Claw_Porter", "post_created_utc": 1521842347.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1521848125.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "86oiel", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 549, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1693, "post_selftext": "Many routines are based around these four lifts (deadlifts, bench press, squat and military/overhead shoulder press).

I didn't count calories at all but looking back, I think I could say I was putting away around 5,000 calories a day on some days. I barely left bed, and chronic insomnia meant I fell asleep at 6am and woke at 4pm most days, getting little to no sunlight throughout the winter. After slowly taking steps to get my life back on track, my body was my next big project. \n\nI started running- only 2km once a week at first, then twice a week, and by August 2015 I was doing 10km four times a week. I counted calories, cut down to about 1,400, and by the time February 2016 rolled round I was at 117lbs, having gone from a UK size 12 to a size 6 (age 20):\nhttp://imgur.com/WjGs0Ue\n\nI went vegan on the first day of 2016, and noticed a massive difference in my recovery time and my energy. I swapped out my 4 runs for 3 lifting sessions and 1 run a week, and loved it. However, at 117lbs I wasn't eating anywhere near as much as I wanted to be able to, and I disliked feeling... small. So I decided to slowly bulk my way up again. I started at about 1,900 calories, and it did... nothing. I increased bit by bit (I was afraid of suddenly putting on a ton of fat, so I was far too careful), and eventually found that my sweet spot for gaining 0.5lbs a week was at an unexpected 2,350 calories a day, at a 50:30:20 (C,F,P) Macro split. I've stuck with that since about August time, and I'm finally here, at 128lbs (age 21):\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/OS0TfDp\n(Bonus back pic): http://imgur.com/MwlasAk\n\nAm I where I want to be yet? No, I intend to bulk up to 135lbs and then cut over the summer, because right now I feel a bit soft on the exterior. But I'm happy with what my body can do, and the wonders that getting in shape have done for my physical and mental health, allowing me to manage my sleep disorders, IBS and anxiety far better than I ever did.

The first day or two I thought it'd just go away, but it got bigger, harder, and more painful. The past three or so days it got to where it hurt to sit up or sit back down, and last night I had issues sleeping. I knew it was an ingrown hair from imperfect shaving technique, I've had one down there before and it went away like nothing happened, but this one was different.\n\nI had already missed Monday in the gym because of the pain, so I was determined to not let this thing rule my life while it healed. So this morning I got up, popped some ibuprofen, and was on my way. It didn't hurt as bad as the last few days so I was pretty happy and thought maybe pretty soon it'd be back to normal.

Midway through the third (I think?) rep I feel this needle-like sensation where my lump is and just a general warmth in that area... and suddenly this off sort of smell comes to my attention. It's happening.\n\nI put the bar back and make my way past the early morning cardio bunnies to the restroom, all the while trying to play it off flicking through my phone. I get to the stall and pull my pants down and the swelling is dripping what I can only describe as melted chocolate ice cream into the toilet. *drip drip drip*\n\nI'm horrified, and THE SMELL is wretched. To say it was like shit would be a complement; it was shits distant, rotting, fly-infested cousin. I quickly shoved my hand into the toilet paper dispenser and pulled out a wad and put it on the wound... it wouldn't stop. I pull out another and squeeze... and then a brook of blood flows out, running over the toilet paper and onto my hand. I'm horrified...\n\nI spend the next ten or so minutes milking that disgusting SOB and its devil fluids, hoping to god nobody noticed a smell or anything while I was near the bench. I pull my underwear up, which I notice is moist, and try to get out of there as fast as possible. I make a b-line for the cubby holes for my keys and hoodie, hoping no one notices me. I notice a guy, pretty buff and obviously knows his way around the gym, near my bench glancing at me (I didn't even rereack). I try to keep a happy face on, but the one or two people I had to pass... their eyes seared through my thin little facade. I'll go back Friday, and pretend nothing happened... just hoping against hope nobody knew what went on.\n\ntl;dr: Shave with the grain...\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "There are worse things than shitting in the squat rack...", "post_ups": 1697, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1x3nvz/there_are_worse_things_than_shitting_in_the_squat/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:20.018388", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Claw_Porter", "post_created_utc": 1492683840.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "66gtq4", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 1443, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1692, "post_selftext": "I'm interested in using some to get in better shape and curb my snacking after meals. \n\nI'm open to anything that works; pill, supplement or otherwise.\n\nHave you guys tried anything that works well for you to suppress your appetite?

Might even consider doing it two times a week just to see how big I can get it in a month or so.

Back with some studies as per usual. A couple of nutrition studies included in this one but I find them relevant and interesting. Hopefully we can all learn some things and feel free to discuss anything!\n\nDoes repetition duration matter for muscle / strength improvements? Carlson et. al (2018) sought to find some answers to this question in their 10 week randomized trial. The theories behind higher durations being superior to lower repetition durations are that the muscles sustain more metabolic stress and the muscles have more time to form molecular bridges within themselves to increase tension (these are myosin-actin bridges, if you remember your high school biology).\n\nThe study recruited 59 subjects from both sexes with all at least having 6 months of prior training at a frequency of at least twice a week. Subjects were allocated to 3 different groups. The groups were differentiated according to their exercise tempo. One group had a 2 second concentric with a 4 second eccentric. The concentric would be where the targeted muscle is being shortened while the eccentric would be the opposite. In a curl, when you lift the weight upwards towards your shoulders, this would be the concentric while the eccentric would include the descent of the weight. The other groups either had a 10\u201310 or a 30\u201330 scheme. A great aspect of this study is that all groups were matched for time under tension.\n\nThe training completed by the subjects was at a frequency of twice per week and loads were determined through 10 repetition maximum tests at baseline testing. Body fat (measured through bodpods and calipers), muscle size (measured with a ruler) and fasted blood glucose was followed in the study. In the end, there were no differences in fat mass, lean mass, body part circumferences or blood glucose between all subjects. Body composition hardly changed in the subjects on average. There were reductions in blood glucose overall. Strength improved amongst everyone on average as well.\n\nThe surprisingly absent lean mass gains were likely related to very low volume in the training routine. Every exercise was only done for 1 set which is likely not enough volume to create any sort of hypertrophic response even over 10 weeks. Absolutely no dietary control was implemented into the study so it is a possible confounding variable (an uncontrolled/unmeasured variable that may affect results). Despite all this, this does show promise to time-efficient training routines for strength gains. This has implications for everyone especially the middle age adults with busy lives and time-consuming jobs as adequate strength levels are correlated with mortality benefits Garc\u00eda-Hermoso et al. (2018).\n\n**TL;DR:** Appears that repetition tempo does not matter much in terms of strength/muscle growth or blood glucose but more studies need to be done especially with adequate volume and dietary control. Shows promise for time-efficient training routines for strength gains as gains were still made with extremely low volume.\n\n\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\n\nThe next study by Gordon et. al (2018) put eccentric exercise against conventional exercise to see which led to better strength improvements as well as performance (jumps and sprints). Eccentric movements have been shown to elicit greater forces compared to its concentric counterpart (Bridgeman, McGuigan & Gill, 2015a). It has even been documented they are superior in terms of hypertrophy, strength gains and power improvement (Farthing & Chilibeck, 2003; Bridgeman, Gill, McGuigan, 2015b). However, most studies do not include exercises that are multi-jointed like a squat or a bench press. These are important because multi-joint movements translate better into gross motor movements like jumping or sprinting.\n\nThe investigation included 26 college-aged men and women who have a training experience of at least 6 months at a frequency of at least once per week. The men and women were allocated to either a leg press group or a group that did just the eccentric of the leg press. The entire study lasted 4 weeks so testing was done at baseline, at 2 weeks and at the end of the study. The following variables were measured: strength, vertical jump, long jump and 40 metre sprint.\n\nFamiliarization with tests were done 3\u20137 days before baseline testing. Baseline testing was done 3\u20137 days before the 1st training session. The final test was conducted 3 days after the final training session. Isometric strength tests (where the joint does not move) were done at different angles with multiple attempts to get the best result. The leg press group used 1 repetition maximum tests to determine strength improvements. The frequency of training was twice a week. Each session involved 6 sets with 8\u201312 repetitions and the training was linearly periodized with intensity increasing by 10% each week (from 55% to 80% by the end of the study).\n\nThe eccentric group consistently improved in strength (measured on the special eccentric leg press machine) throughout the study while the conventional leg press group only improved from halfway to the end of the study. However, it must be remembered that these were all done on the eccentric leg press machine as the conventional group made strength improvements in their 1RM testing. Slight improvement for vertical jumps were seen in both groups and a similar improvement in sprints were seen in the conventional leg press group (~1%) but overall, not many performance gains were seen in either group.\n\nIt is confusing as to why both groups underwent eccentric strength testing but only the conventional group did leg press 1RM testing. It is highly possible the eccentric group showed better strength results as they had more specific training (the conventional leg press group only used the machine for testing, not for training) and strength responds well to specificity. It is also possible that the eccentric group had better gains because of a novelty effect. A new type of training stimulus was exposed to this group and this may elicit bigger, acute gains. The subjects were likely already exposed to the conventional leg press throughout their training history so a novelty effect in the conventional group is unlikely.\n\nThe authors argued that even when comparing that even when comparing the results of the 1RM tests and the eccentric machine tests, the gains are still greater in the eccentric group. However, we cannot directly compare results of 2 different tests like this. It is also worth noting that some participants reported knee problems while doing the eccentric leg press programme. Knee extensor/flexor strength tests were done but hip strength should have also been assessed given the multi-joint nature of the exercise. Like the above study, strength gains were made with very little time invested (the eccentric group only trained 6 minutes a week). It is undocumented as to how long the conventional group\u2019s sessions.\n\nLastly, the authors pointed out that due to the short duration of the study, the acute improvements seen may be relevant in a clinical context. They say that the quick improvements may be beneficial for the injured so that they can recover faster. This idea seems to be myopic as the rehabilitation process can span much more than 4 weeks and strength/torque are only a small fragment of the relevant clinical outcomes in the recovery process. It takes longer experiment durations and follow-ups to determine which intervention is truly more effective in the long term. Despite this, it is worth looking into in future clinical studies.\n\n**TL;DR:** Eccentric exercise has better results in eccentric strength tests than conventional exercise. Performance measures like jumping and sprinting are similar. Future studies need to use the same strength tests for all groups as well as control for a novelty training effect.\n\n\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\n\nThis paper has been making its rounds through the nutrition community recently. Hall (2019) carried out a randomized controlled trial examining the effects of an ultraprocessed diet on health compared to an unprocessed diet. Processed foods are ever-growing in today\u2019s market; they have made their way into several households all over the world and for good reason. Processed foods last very long, are generally free from germs and are cheap. Unfortunately, there appears to be some correlation with processed food consumption and obesity / type II diabetes. The theory behind this link is that processed foods are hyper-palatable and they have a very high caloric content. Beyond these two theories though, there has been some research observing processed food\u2019s effects on the relationship between the brain and the gut (Small & DiFeliceantonio, 2019). Given that current research only demonstrates a correlation between processed foods and the highlighted chronic diseases, this trial is important to extrapolate some causation.\n\nA critical design detail is that this study was conducted in a ward where diet was very tightly controlled. The investigation recruited 20 individuals with a 50/50 split of males and females. Subjects were blind to all measurements and were weight-stable prior to the beginning of the study (i.e. they were not gaining/losing weight prior). Participants also wore loose clothing throughout the experiment to blind themselves to any weight loss/gain. Body weight was taken daily. A dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan was done weekly for measure body fat. A magnetic resonance imagery scan was done weekly as well to observe for liver fat changes. Appetite was measured every 3 days before meals and every 0.5/1 hour post-meal for 2\u20133 hours. The palatability of each meal was also taken into account. Accelerometers were attached to every patient to follow daily physical activity. Energy expenditure was actually quantified through various methods to get accurate results. Finally, blood glucose was followed continuously throughout the study. As you can see, several relevant variables were closely assessed which is fantastic.\n\nEach group would undergo 2 weeks of an ultraprocessed diet and 2 weeks of a processed diet in random order. There would be 3 meals a day, all matched for calories, caloric density, carbohydrates, fats, protein, salt, fiber, sugar and palatability. The total amount of food offered was calculated to be twice the maintenance energy requirements of each individual (2 * the amount of energy required to maintain your body mass). For each meal, the subjects were given 1 hour to consume however much they wanted. Snacks were also provided and also matched. Participants also did regular exercise by cycling thrice daily for 20 minutes at a matched intensity.\n\n500 more calories were consumed in the ultraprocessed food group. 280 calories came from carbohydrates and 200 calories came from fat. None of the 500 came from protein which would support the protein leverage hypothesis which states that the body will continue to eat until its protein requirements are met. This hypothesis is relevant because the body will continue to eat unhealthy foods low in protein until it meets protein requirements which can contribute to metabolic problems and other health issues. However, assuming perfect leverage, the theory can only account for 50% of the 500 calories as calculated by the author. 124 more calories were eaten at breakfast, 213 calories more at lunch and not much more at dinner.\n\nHunger, palatability, liver fat and blood glucose were the same between groups. Despite controlling for caloric density, the ultraprocessed group ate more calorically dense foods. The ultraprocessed group also ate their meals much quicker and the speed of meal of consumption has been correlated to overall intake. The ultraprocessed group gained 0.8kg with 0.5kg of it being fat while the unprocessed group lost 1.1kg with a 0.3kg loss of fat. The ultraprocessed group had higher recorded energy expenditures which would be expected given the weight gain. Peptide-YY, a protein which inhibits hunger, was elevated in the ultraprocessed group while ghrelin, a protein which stimulates hunger, was lowered. Insulin and insulin resistance were lower in the unprocessed group.\n\nDespite glucose tolerance being the same, it is possible that the regular exercise stabilized the glucose tolerance for both groups and not due to the diets eliciting the same effects on blood glucose. The author highlights that these findings are in line with other studies that show a 20% increase in meal consumption speed equals to 10\u201313% more food consumed (Forde, 2018).\n\n**TL;DR:** Processed foods lead to more weight gain.\n\n\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\n\nContreras et. al (2017) investigated the different effects between hip thrusts and front squats on various performance tests like 10/20 meter sprints, vertical/horizontal jumps, isometric mid-thigh pulls (basically an isometric at the midpoint of the deadlift range of motion) and 3 repetition-maximum tests of each lift. The authors hypothesized that we should see better results in sprints from hip thrusts because the load is transferred back and forth between the front and the back of the body, a similar movement to a sprint. The same was said about front squats for jumping except the load would be transferred vertically.\n\n24 college-aged males with squat experience trained twice a week in either a front squat programme or a hip thrust programme for 6 weeks. The training programme was periodized for both groups and each exercise consisted of 4 sets done to failure with 3 minutes of rest. All participants completed upper body and core exercises along with either the front squat or the hip thrust in every session. Every training day was at least 72 hours after the previous one.\n\nThe hip thrust group had the greatest improvements in the 20 meter sprint, mid-thigh pull and hip thrust 3 repetition maximum test. The front squat group experienced the greatest improvements in the 3 repetition maximum test of both the front squat and the hip thrust as well as the vertical jump. It must be noted that the improvement in the hip thrust 3 repetition maximum test from the front squat group was not as significant as the hip thrust group\u2019s results (43% improvement vs 21%). Horizontal jump results were about the same between groups.\n\nThe results coincided well with the authors\u2019 hypotheses. The better results in the mid-thigh pull from the hip thrust group were probably linked to the more similar end-range hip extension seen in hip thrusts. The front squat also involves hip extension but the movement is easier as you ascend up in squat (easier in regards to the forces required in hip extension) as opposed to the hip thrust where the load is constant.\n\nFuture studies should include different performance measures like a longer sprint test (100/200 meters). Another group training in both the front squat and the hip thrust would be great too as some synergy between the two exercises likely exists. Training history amongst participants should also include hip thrust history to match the squat history next time.\n\n**TL;DR:** Front squats are better for jumping and hip thrusts are better for sprinting in college-aged males.\n\n\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\n\nCould the number of push-ups you are able to do have any effect on the odds of you getting heart problems? Yang, Christophi & Farioli (2019) sought to answer this question in their longitudinal study that has been popping up all over the news recently. Cardiovascular fitness is something that is not checked regularly by physicians but when it is, it is generally done in the form of subjective, self-reported questionnaires. Objective measures like VO2 max (how much oxygen your body can use at once) give a much more accurate snapshot of one\u2019s cardiovascular fitness compared to the subjective data. Unfortunately, measures like VO2 max takes a lot of effort, money and time to record. This is where your push-up max comes into play. If such a number were well correlated with your cardiovascular fitness, it could be included in clinical testing and would save an immense amount of money / effort.\n\nTo examine the relationship, scoured the push-up max records of over 1000 firefighters from 2000\u20132010. The firefighters were aged anywhere from 21 to 66 years old but 39 was the average age. The manner in which the push up tests were conducted was that the firefighters followed a metronome of 80 beats per minute for their push-ups. They would continue until they reached 60 repetitions, missed 3 beats or simply could not do anymore before reaching 60 repetitions. The cardiovascular outcomes the researchers were following were major events like heart failure or sudden cardiac death. A diagnosis of coronary artery disease (a blockage in the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart) was also included in the outcomes. Each firefighter was followed from their first push-up test up until a cardiovascular event or until the end date which was 31/12/2010.\n\nA total of 37 cardiovascular incidents occurred amongst the firefighters in that decade. Push-up max was shown to have an inverse correlation with age, body mass index, blood pressure, low density lipoprotein (a protein which carries cholesterol, generally desired to be kept at low blood levels), triglycerides (fats), glucose and smoking status. Push-up max was positively correlated with VO2 max.\n\nThe stunning statistic that has been the headline of several news articles is that the firefighters who were able to do over 40 push-ups, were 96% less likely to experience cardiovascular incidents compared to those who could do only do less than 10 push-ups. Even the firefighters who could only do 11\u201320 push-ups had a 64% less likely chance compared to the lowest group. Within the results of this study, push-ups actually had a closer correlation with cardiovascular events than VO2 max.\n\nWhile this is all quite exciting, it must be remembered that we are simply witnessing a correlation here. One cannot state that a push-up max alone can predict future cardiovascular incidents. More studies need to be done to see if similar results can be found. Other studies should control for more variables as well.\n\n**TL;DR:** Your push-up max may be a fantastic indicator of your cardiovascular fitness. Simply being able to do over 10 push-ups leads to a massive decrease in chances of suffering from cardiovascular incidents. Has promise to be included in future clinical tests but must be noted that for now, this is but a simple correlation from one study.\n\n\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\n\nThe final study here will be covered briefly. It\u2019s a meta-analysis (pooling of studies together) by Toews et al. (2019) probing into the world of artificial sweeteners and their consequences on health. This study was actually funded by the World Health Organization as this study would help the organization form guidelines on artificial sweeteners consumption.\n\nThe primary outcomes of interest were body weight changes, oral health, diabetes and eating behavior. Secondary outcomes included preference for sweet foods, various disease incidence rates, mood and cognition. While there are several observations to pick at from the myriad of studies included, it is unfortunate to say that most of the evidence is not strong enough to make any solid statements. Most of the observed correlations were deemed very low or low level evidence by the authors. None of the relationships presented were even considered high level evidence. Some of the moderate level evidence includes artificial sweeteners not having an effect on mood and artificial sweeteners having less body mass index records in children compared to those who do not consume artificial sweeteners.\n\nAt this point, we cannot say that there is a negative effect of artificial sweeteners on health but we cannot say there is a positive effect either. Future studies need to follow similar study designs to facilitate future meta-analyses. Studies also need to be more transparent as the authors noted that some studies did not reveal the doses in which artificial sweeteners were administered. Future reviews should also include other aspects of health like gut microbiota since artificial sweeteners are able to inhibit bacteria reproduction. This is the reason why oral health was included in this study.\n\n**TL;DR:** Positive or negative effects of artificial sweeteners on health have yet to be fleshed out.\n\n\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\n\nBridgeman, L.

Okay to clear some things up, for anyone not aware, \"Lunk\" is the term that Planet Fitness uses for the type of person who goes to the gym in a stringer or tank top, lifts heavy weights, grunts, brings in a gallon jug, and judges other people. I use the word lunk to describe myself jokingly as I do all of those things, however I do not judge. I am not a huge dude, I am 5' 9\" 185lbs, and pretty lean. Big by Planet fitness standards and let me tell you I could feel the judgment the second I walked in. I was very polite, very understanding that I would not be looked upon to kindly of by some of the patrons, so I did my best to be overly polite and compliant, and as I always have, treat every stranger with the respect we all deserve. I get to the desk, \"sign here here and here yada yada yada\" and I begin working out. The colors are a little over the top, and dumbbells only go up to 75's but I could deal. Actually if anything it made it easier not to drop weights too hard(one of their big no no's). Let me tell you, the people there were very timid, a lot of them seemed low confidence, but none of them gave me even the slightest dirty look.  A few guys started making conversation with me and to tell you the truth they were some of the most sincere people I've met at the gym. We jumped in with each other on machines, pushed eachother, and spotted each other. I left the gym everyday with less and less resentment towards the place. I get that it's not a bodybuilders gym, if anything it's the worst place for power lifters and BB. However I just wanted to share with ya'll that they are not as bad as they're made out to be. End of the day it is a corporate establishment and they can cater to whoever they want. However the one thing is sure about every gym and it's that they are filled with people from all walks of life just trying to be a better version of themselves.  Sorry for the rant but its just something I wanted to share as most of the things I read about planet fitness are negative and usually bashing it. I too was guilty of the same thing for a long time.

Around 2010 I received news at 420 pounds that I was in the early stages of type 2 diabetes and at age 19 that's not something anyone wants to hear. So finally in my life I kind of received a wake up call for change. It started out as walking down the street and back, then a half mile, then a mile, then two, then three, jogging a mile etc etc. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/7MKUl56 \nthat's me around 400, unfortunately I never really took  a lot or pictures when I was super heavy for obvious reasons. I am 6 foot 5 so thankfully it's not as bad for me as it is for others. \n\nAnd here I am now at a comfortable 240. \nhttp://imgur.com/qbF2aeJ\n\nIf you don't want to upvote please don't, I only wanted to post this to hopefully inspire someone. Something as easy as just walking down the street, or not eating a second helping. I used to think food was my only happiness, and I would eat when I was bored. Simple steps for big changes. Love you all Reddit! \n\nAnd here's a picture of my cat Bruce Wayne in a bowtie for the real karma whoring.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/afh8NL7\n\n***edit***\n\nThank you so much for the love guys! It really put a swagger in my step today at work haha. Also I've gotten a couple PMs asking for advice, please do not be shy I am more then happy to help anyone I can. :) I'll be back next year with my progress on my lifts, this isn't even my final form!\n\n**edit**\nStill amazed at the support, for real thank you guys! Been a little busy but some people have asked me how my routine started. My advice is focus on your diet first, get comfortable counting your calories for a few weeks first before you worry about exercise, the sad truth is if you don't eat properly you're not gonna see results. I have used [My Fitness Pal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) and it has been my savior. [Learn how to take your pulse](http://takeyourpulse.org/take-your-pulse/) or [invest in a heart rate monitor](http://www.amazon.com/Wahoo-TICKR-Monitor-iPhone-Android/dp/B00INQVYZ8/ref=zg_bs_3407971_10), thats the one I personally use. Find your healthy cardio heart rate range, 5 minute warm up, then spend 5 minutes building up to that rate, then spend 15 minutes in that zone, cool down for 5 mins. Find an exercise you can enjoy,  I enjoy running and listening to audio books. \n\nIt took me about 2 months to really see a change, take a monthly photo of yourself, you'd be amazed at how much your features change with a healthy diet. Dont live by the scale, use it but don't be a slave to it, measurements can be a much better feeling. Cut out caloric drinks, and diet soda, drink water and decaf tea, use caffeinated tea sparingly. But allow yourself one day a week where you can have fun, it doesn't have to be hell. This is a lifestyle change, its not something you're gonna do for a year, its gonna be alooooot longer hopefully. \n\nMy routine now is a 5 day split, \n\nMonday - Back - 15 minutes ab work after\n\nTuesday - AM Run - PM Chest\n\nWednesday - Arms\n\nThursday - AM Run - PM Shoulders\n\nFriday - Legs - 15 minutes ab work after\n\nSaturday I will possibly do some light cardio and stretching work depending on how I feel, I like top think of it as poor mans yoga lol. (I know nothing about yoga lol)\n\nSunday - Football and cheat day!\n\nI try to stick to this schedule as best as possible but sadly I work retail and so it can vary sometimes. I have only been seriously lifting for about a month so I can't really tell you what you should and shouldn't do, if your looking to get huge ive heard nothing but great things about Strongmans 5x5, personally I'm just looking to be healthy, before I started lifting I would run about 20 miles a week, make sure you change things up every once and while its good for your overall weight loss and its also nice to adventure a little. Oh and for those asking I have my diabetes completely under control, I take no glucophage anymore so in a way you could say I'm diabetes free. \n\nI hope a little bit of this helps guys im not perfect either, I'm just trying like the rest of you.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "My Transformation", "post_ups": 1668, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2ohq62/my_transformation/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:22.273050", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "aazav", "post_created_utc": 1362073718.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1362173622.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "19enq6", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 445, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1666, "post_selftext": "The deed is done.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ohVxMfW.jpg\n\nOthers are helping out too getting extra 100 lb. plates and coordinating the effort.\n\nBarring any stupid mistakes over email (yikes), this should be awesome donate the tools/equipment so that Ray can reach his max.\n\nOriginal link: http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/199es0/meet_the_man_who_squats_905raw/\n\n**Update 01:** A UPS shipping label has been created.

Men are, on average, clearly more muscular and stronger than women pre-training, and gain a larger absolute amount of muscle and strength.  However:\n\n1) In the short term, women seem to gain more relative strength than men.  This is primarily the case for upper body strength, and for younger women.  For lower body strength and older people, proportional strength gains seem to be the same between sexes.\n\n2) Relative increases in muscle seem to be the same between sexes.  This is true for both direct measures of muscle growth, and indirect measures.\n\n3) Long-term, relative strength gains and muscle growth seem to be similar between sexes.  However, when looking at competitive athletes, you can make the case that relative gains may be *slightly* larger in women across an entire training career.\n\nHowever, even though proportional gains in strength and muscle mass seem to be most similar between sexes, there are other differences to consider.  Women seem to be a bit less acutely fatiguable than men, and seem to recover from training a bit faster.  Futhermore, for women not on birth control, rates of recovery and responsiveness to training vary based on menstrual cycle phase as well (women recover faster, and gain more strength and muscle during their follicular phase than their luteal phase).\n\nThose are the high points.

Cheers!******\n\n\n\n/u/superman_king made a post on NYE that led me to discover Lean Gains. \n\nSome would say I spent NYE alone this year.  Others, like myself, would tend to think I spent it with my best friend (Bob- best dog in the world).  Bob was holding down the fort looking out the window for bitches while I was messing around on Reddit, and saw http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2qy30b/here_is_my_body_before_after_getting_a_job_at/  on the front page.  Read that post if you have any questions.  I used the same references that he used as a starting point of reference.  \n\nAt first I clicked the link expecting to see the opposite.  But seeing that picture and reading this post ended up inspiring me in ways you couldn't imagine.  I spent the next few hours reading about intermittent fasting and lean gains, what macros were, and how I had no clue about what the fuck I was doing in regards to nutrition and my stale-ass workout. I took it one step at a time reading about Lean Gains for the next few days and started following the protocol on January 3rd. \n\nHere is me on day 1:  http://imgur.com/Yv3MuUt\n\nI started the protocol weighing in at about 167lbs.  I am 5'8''.  I decided to aim for the target weight of 143 as this was my weight about eight years ago when I was bartending and in much better shape. \n\nAfter about 10 days I was starting to fear that I would fall of the wagon and start taking out clips of Double Stuffed E.L Fudge and negate what I was working so hard to achieve.  I remained strong as I kept seeing a post on Facebook about a 12 Week Body Transformation Contest that was going on at my wonderful gym.  Knowing that they take before & after shots (that they would eventually post up on the walls) I entered myself in the contest to hold myself accountable.  \n\nAfter a few weeks of following the protocol and taking it one day at a time and learning tricks of the trade when it came to meal preparation and stuff, I started to see results.  After about a month or so, things just became easy and I somewhat started to enjoy the simple routine of eating the same thing every day, day in and day out.  (Varying depending on if I was working out or not)  \n\nI found that using MyFitnessPal was one of the most helpful tools in keeping me \"honest\" and not reverting to junk. I also accepted about 3 weeks into the protocol that if I was going to indulge in chocolate (my kryptonite) that I would do in the form of a delicious chocolate chip cookie dough (microwaved for 26 seconds of course) Quest bar.  Also, I found myself to saving a ton of money.  I never realized how much I found myself getting takeout or something \"easy\" that would result in a nice little debit of $10-15.  \n\nLast Wednesday marked the end of the 12 week transformation contest at my gym and I was very proud of my results. \n\nThe morning of I snapped this picture: http://imgur.com/5huvXXP\n\nHere is the final form photo: http://imgur.com/N4e97OH \nSince I had already been two weeks into Lean Gains, I had already saw my body starting to change pretty.  I would have killed this contest even more had I started when I first started Lean Gains.  \n\nI weighed in down 15.6lbs (down about 23 total)\nMy waist went from 31.25\" to 28.5\"\nHips from 37.75\" to 36\"\nThighs from 22.25\" to 20\"\nBody fat from 20.7% to 8.4% (12.3 total)  \n\nOne thing:  I SWEAR I never skipped leg day. :)  I'll admit I was somewhat disappointed with how my legs came out, as for the first time in my life I started to squat and do Romanian deadlifts. \n\nAlso:  go out of your way and buy a Total Gym pullup bar.  My $30 investment has paid massive dividends as I went from being able to do 3 pullups to 12 weighted 25lb pullups.  I never thought I'd say this, but back workouts are my favorite now.  \n\nIf you are inspired, I strongly urge you to go back and check out that post.  I went back and forth on whether or not I wanted to share this with Reddit, but I feel I owe it to this sub and /u/superman_king to at least acknowledge just how much that post helped me get back into the best shape of my life.  \n\nSupplements I took:\n\nFish Oil: Omega-3 Fish Oil NutriGold\nXtend BCAAs\nBeta Alanine\nOptimum Nutrition Whey\nOptimum Nutrition Casein\n\nEDIT:  Some people have asked about my actually daily diet.   \n\nRegarding my actual food plan: I found a sample food plan (located at http://shockingfit.com/leangains-guide-review-sample-meal-plan/ (READ THAT ALL + http://shockingfit.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ShockingFit-Lean-gains.xls) and and fine tuned it to my weight and proportion. If people are interested enough I will try to figure out a way to attach the spreadsheet.  It was really helpful and honestly the most time consuming part of discovering lean gains.  Everyone is different and their meal plans should reflect so. \n\nTypical Workout Day: breakfast 11:30am\nOrganic Oats 60g (225cal), 5 egg whites (125 cal), 30g almonds (180 cal), 1/4cup Omega-3 mix (160 cal), 1 scoop of whey (120 cal), banana (89 cal)  = 900 calories\n\nDinner: 5:30pm\n126g of Brown Rice (450cal), 150g of Lean chicken breast (165cal), 1 cup green beans (25 cal), 30g almonds (180 cal), 5 egg whites (125 cal), and either a Quest bar or a homeade vanilla almond protein bar (instructions to follow when I get home or if someone is interested in the recipe)  Total cals = 1200 \n\nThat's roughly 2100 or so calories (hence why I said I usually struggled making the last few hundred calories a day)\n\nNon workout day: Breakfast 11:30am  (1600 calories)\nOrganic Oats 40g (150 cal), 6 egg whites (150 cal), 30g almonds (180 cal), 1/4 cup omega-3 (160 cal), 2 scoops of Whey (240 cal),\n12oz Almond Milk (150cal)      = 1030 calories\n\nDinner: 42g - 1 turkey burger pattie (190 cal) 1/4 cup brown rice, (150 cal), 150g lean chicken breast (165 cal), 1 cup green beans (25 cal), 2 egg whites (50 cal), and 30g almonds.       = 770 cal\n\nSome tips:  I started to consolidate my egg white intake to either breakfast or dinner (made things easier).  I also started to mix the omega-3 mix and almonds in the with the organic oats which made it into a rather enjoyable meal. The numbers above aren't exact.  Nowadays, I can pretty much roughly estimate my caloric intake based on the same food I eat and now I have fun with it.  Some days, I eat as much as 3 turkey burger patties!!   \n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "A post I saw on /r/fitness on NYE helped inspired me to participate in a 12 week body transformation contest.

The first reason for posting here is to give back to the community forum that I have spent countless hours reading every night, be it the hot, new, rising, or controversial category.  I also found and relied on it as a heavy source of motivation, from people who surpassed their personal records, to great transformations.  This is my transformation.\n\n[Full transformation](http://i.imgur.com/WNg91B3.jpg)\n\n* **My Background**\n\nI'm 23, 5'8, and of south-east Asian ethnicity.  Let me first start off by stating that I am not completely new to lifting weights or sports.  I have been on sports teams back in high school, and familiar with weight lifting, although never \"lifted seriously\".  Since high school, I have always lifted for several months a year, than got lazy/lost motivation (you know what it's like ;) ) and didn't pick it up again until the next year.  I was always active though.\n\n[November 2012, 186 lbs](http://i.imgur.com/d1rwV7e.jpg)\n\nAnyway, the before photo that is dated November 2012 was captured after a year of inactivity due to a surgery that did not allow me to perform any physical activities.  Before that, I just looked like your average Asian skinny stereotype (video games, math, martial arts, etc).\n\n\n* .  **My Diet**\n\n[February 2013, ~170 lbs](http://i.imgur.com/Br8dVf9.jpg)\n\nThe first three months was where I lost most of my fat.  What I have learnt is that diet is the absolute number one, key factor to losing weight.  I cannot stress that enough!  It is more important than working out.  You basically are what you eat (and how much).\n\nThe beginning was also the hardest because it took time to adapt to a new lifestyle.  This transformation is not just a physical change, but also a mental one which changed my outlook in life.  Not only that but it is a total change in lifestyle.  The first month was very hard because I literally started eating half of what I usually ate (which was like a fat pig).  My previous diet consisted of a couple cups of rice every meal (about five meals a day), along with meat that could be pork, beef, chicken, or fish.  I never ate vegetables, but I do now.  \n\nHunger was what I felt every day and night, 24/7.  Eventually my new diet became a habit and was incorporated into my normal diet.  I kept the same diet (a tiny bit of rice, mostly meat, and some vegetables, exactly 3 times a day) for the next many months and continued lifting every day).\n\n***Diet Example, this is example of one day.  I do not eat the same meal everyday***\n\n*Wake up*\n\n* meal 1: 1 cup of rice, lean ground beef, onions \n\n4 hours later\n\n* meal 2: any meat (beef, pork chop, ribs, chicken wings, chicken strip, salmon), + any vegetable (Brock, bean sprout, spinach, cucumbers, mixed spring greens)\n\n4 hours later\n\n* meal 3: same idea as meal 2\n\n*after the 3rd and final meal of the day: I starve for the rest of the day :(.  Drink plenty of water!*\n\n\nI keep my diet simple.  If you want variety, add different sauces!  Try different meats!  Different vegetable combinations!  The main idea is to not eat a lot.  What I find helps is to smell my friends foods when I'm with them.  Just smell, but don't eat.\n\n\n* **Cheat meals/refeeding**\n\nThis is required so you don't go insane.  I ate \"normally\" once a week, every Sunday.  The remaining six days of the week, I ate at a calorie deficiency.\n\n* **Supplements**\n\n[May 2013, 165 -170 lbs](http://i.imgur.com/z1JDF8c.jpg)\n\n1. Protein - I only purchase protein when it is on sale, like buy 1, get 1 free.  I don't take it every day, only when I feel as if I have not had enough meat that day (which comes up to about once a week).  That means I only take protein shakes when I need to, to supplement my diet.  \n* Coffee - some days I needed to down a cup of coffee to give me a boost of energy for the workout.  When I didn't eat much food, I felt like I didn't have much energy at all, so I relied on caffeine. \n1. Pre-workouts - I use this occasionally (still have a container of 60 servings from 6 months ago).  It works similarly to caffeine, but a bit different.  Nice to have once in a while!\n\n\n* **The Workout**\n\n[August 2013, ~163 lbs](http://i.imgur.com/TReGikI.jpg)\n\nLike I mentioned earlier in my post, I started playing around with weights back in high school (around six years ago).  I actually started with the program Starting Strength, which allowed me to learn the basic principles of lifting, the major important movements (bench, squat, deadlift, rows), and formed the base of my body to grow from.  \n\nWhen I first started lifting, I would always look at the clock and try to finish my workout as quickly as possible so that I would be set \"free\" from the \"burden\" of keeping my body physically fit.  My attitude towards the weight room has turned a complete 180, and I try to stay in the gym as long as I can (90 to 120 minutes a workout) because it is now my hobby and is FUN!\n\nI do not have a workout routine anymore (have not had one for a couple years).  I always go by feeling.  I do what I feel like doing that day, at that moment. It's not a scheduled program for me that I have to complete.  I go because I want to and because it is a hobby that I really enjoy (like playing video games).  I do not feel bound to a regiment or any strict programs.  I don't have a strict amount of sets I have to finish per workout, or a set amount of reps I have to complete.  This keeps it fresh.\n\n* **My \"Routine\"**\n\n[November 2013, 161 lbs](http://i.imgur.com/jH1iKOI.jpg)\n\nI do a mixture of power lifting, and hypertrophy workouts.  Some days I feel like lifting heavy, so I load up the plates and grind out 4-8 reps.  Some days I feel like taking it \"easy\" and burn out my muscles with a high amount of reps (12-25) (amazing pumps).  What I always will do is push myself.  For example, I don't plan on doing a set with ten reps then rest.  If I can do ten reps, then I do a bonus rep.  If I can complete that bonus rep, then I do another bonus rep.  If I was able to complete a few extra reps, I up the weight.\n\nPeople will most likely ask, so these are my current numbers for five reps.  My max is unknown.\n\n* bench: 225 lbs\n* squat: 275 lbs\n* deadlift: 315 lbs\n\n\nFurthermore, my workout programs are always different every week (this is most likely the result of having multiple workout partners, and has become a habit).\n\nExample for one week:\n\n* Monday: chest and tris\n* Tuesday: back and bis\n* Wednesday: chest and tris (again, because buddy wants to do it)\n* Thursday: back and bis (again, because I have an urge to have a pattern \"correct\")  \n* Friday: legs\n* Saturday: shoulders (because it hasn't been worked this week yet)\n\nExample from another week\n\n* Monday: arms (biceps, triceps, and forearm (my favourite day)).\n* Tuesday: shoulders\n* Wednesday: arms (again,  because buddy#2 wants to)\n* Thursday: back and chest (needs to be done every week, and the week is almost over!)\n* Friday: arms (again, because my week has to be arms, xyz, arms, xyz, arms, xyz (a pattern))\n* Saturday: legs and shoulders\n\nI use everything from the barbell, dumbell, cables, machines, kettles, and whatever I find in the gym.  Every time I workout with someone, I always follow their routine.  I pretend to myself that I have no knowledge of working out, and learn from them and incorporated it into my database (in my head).  I'm always looking for new types of movements to perform, and have recently starting performing clean and jerks.  \n\n\n* **Cardio**\n\nMy main source of cardio is from playing basketball.  I usually play three times a week, with each session being an hour long.  I do make sure to run 2.4km once or twice a month though, to upkeep my cardiovascular system.\n\n\n* **Conclusion**\n\n[Pumped, post workout](http://i.imgur.com/rnkQXnY.jpg)\n\nI hope that this post has been a meaningful contribution towards this fitness community, and that my personal experience and knowledge is at least helpful to some out there.  The progress photos and long post is to aid those who are seeking motivation and proof that a long term commitment will reward a positive outcome.  As you can see, my physical appearance has changed.  But what you most likely do not see is the mental change that has transpired inside my mind.  I believe that fitness is a hobby that translate well into other parts of a person's life.\n\nThe two most important key points I want to have stand out is \n\n* diet\n* and\n* consistency\n\nThese two factors are what kept me moving forward when I'm not reading this board.  Keep in mind that progress is slow.  Change is gradual.  \n\nIf I have missed anything else, let me know and I can add it into this post.

When I see your progress posts or read your stories, it makes me push myself harder. You are all amazing people.  For those of you beginning your journey now, you got this. \n\n**MY STORY**\n\n\nIt started with a girl, like many of these progress posts seem to. I expressed my feelings and was told that I was not \"boyfriend material.\" Hearing that made me melt down, partially because of my feelings, but mostly because I knew she was right. I had spent my first 3 years of college being the lazy kid, and more importantly, I had lost track of myself. My humor was rude, my diet was atrocious, and my motivation was at all all time low. I broke my ankle and leg in the middle of my sophmore year and during my weeks stuck on the couch, I became addicted to playing league of legends, an online computer game. \n\nThese last 3 years were extremely difficult for me - my negative feelings consumed me, and I genuinely believed I would never feel differently. Despite how hard it was to hear, I am thankful that I had a wake up call - it  made me remember who I was and realize who I could be.  \n\nWhat started out as something I did for her has transformed into a passion that has taught me infinitely more than how to pick up and put down heavy things. I will touch on what I've learned later in the post, but what I will say now is that it truly amazes me every day. \n\n\n**DIET**\n\n*Note: I am lactose intolerant*\n\n\nIt all started with paying a little bit of attention to my intake. I dropped junk food for the most part and was more concious of the overall quality of food - aka, no mcdonalds, no dominos. \n\n\nWhen I got home from school for the summer, I took cutting seriously - I wanted my fat gone. \n\n**[Here is a photo of me at my thinnest \\(~185-190 ---> ~175\\).](http://i.imgur.com/hZmCspH.jpg) This was 1 months difference.**\n\n*The cut*\n\n\n- I ate 1600-1800 calories a day, working out 6 days a week. \n- I lifted intensely for ~1.5 hours and followed that with 25 minutes of interval training, where I was burning 400-500 more calories.   I used the Arc Trainer cycling between high and low intensity since my ankle isn't fully recovered (can't fully run).\n- This cut lasted ~3-4 weeks. \n\n\nOn my cut my meals looked like this:\n\n\n- Breakfast: *omelette, 2 scoop protein (after morning workout)*\n- Lunch: *grilled chicken, tuna, or burger on wheat*\n- Dinner: *grilled chicken or burger, salad, tons of veggies, whole wheat pasta or brown rice*\n\n\nAt the end of my cut, I began seeing slight stalls in my lifts. Because I am new, my lifts were going up throughout my cut, but something started to seem off. Based on a lot of browsing this sub, I knew I had to up my intake to gain muscle - I also didn't have much more fat to lose. I started aiming for 2200 a day, as I was having trouble getting myself to eat more. Now, I am trying to get up to ~2700 a day to break even or to 3000 for a slow bulk, but I'm having trouble getting myself to eat more.  I think it is largely mental - a fear of moving backwards and gaining fat again.\n\n*Current Eating*: pretty much the same food as the cut, just more of it, and snacks.\n\n**I aim for 200g of protein a day - achieved through eggs, meat, wheat bread, and whey shakes**\n\n*I also aim for a certain number of carbs (300-400g) and fats (60g) on a training day* but am not as strict about this.  I used [this site](http://sareyko.net/leancalc/#/g=male/a=NaN/w=NaN/h=NaN/b=NaN/m=1.2/r=-20/t=20/p=2.5/e=NaN) to calculate all of this.\n\n- I eat ~2500-2700 a day\n- Breakfast: *2 eggs, sausage, wheat toast*\n- Lunch: *turkey, tuna, or chicken on wheat*\n- Dinner: *chicken or beef, brown rice or whole wheat pasta , broccoli/veggies, salad, 2 scoops whey (Isopure)*\n- Snacks: *fruit, healthy protein bar*\n- Alcohol: *I've had about 3 beers since I started to take my diet seriously*\n\n**LIFTS**\n\nI haven't really kept track of my 1RM, but here is what I know.\n\n6/28 - **Bench** - 185 x 5; current 1RM: ~210\n\n7/30 - **Bench** - current 1RM: 225\n\n\n\n**ROUTINE**\n\n*Note: I have a permanent back injury (disc degeneration at my L5 S1) preventing me from doing heavy squats and deadlifts. Because of this, some of the compound lifting programs weren't an ideal option.* \n\nI've always done a variation of a 3 day split.  I lift for nearly 2 hours 6 days a week, never a muscle group that is sore.\n\n- **My current 3 day split:** chest/tri, back/bi, shoulders/legs. Abs every other day or more - same with obliques. Currently no cardio, as I dont want to lose. \n\n- [Here is a screenshot showing the exercises I do](http://i.imgur.com/t8PzSDy.png), just to keep this from being overwhelmingly long.  \n- Super sets have been a staple of my workout since I started\n\n\n**MENTALITY**\n\nI've come to learn that lifting is as much a mental battle as it is a physical one.  Luckily, I had a girl I wanted to prove wrong to power me through my first few weeks of pain and soreness, and to help me push out my last few reps or that final set.  I'm not exaggerating when I say this was **HUGE**.  Having a constant source of motivation like that made a very very big difference for me.  \n\nSince I've stopped caring about her, I've actually struggled a little bit with getting to that \"next level\" of intensity and motivation.  Sure, I try to get pumped up before the gym, but my focus faded slightly and the intensity did as well.  \n\nThings that have helped me stay motivated since then\n\n- Fast Paced Rap ([here's a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Wyy2Y0G.png))\n- [Kai Greene Training Videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL1B_r9nC9k)\n- Focusing on working my muscles efficiently rather than the amount of weight I am working with.\n- Thinking of the insane progress posts I see on this sub every day.\n\nYou may think you are giving it your all, but there is often a \"next level\" of your energy that you can reach.  It sounds obvious, but try to focus on the specific muscle you are working every time you are working it.  **Form is crucial.** Putting that extra 5 pounds on may make you tweak your shoulder or arm in a way that stops you from working the muscle efficiently.  \n\n\n**WHAT I'VE LEARNED**\n\nI could write forever about what this process has taught me, but again, I'll try to keep it short. \n\nLike it starts for many, I entered the gym with the goal of simply looking better; I was extremely unhappy with how I looked and knew I had let myself go.  While looking better is still a priority of mine, pushing myself in the gym and dedicating myself to a healthy lifestyle has taught me what I am truly capable of.  \n\nWhen I look in the mirror at the gym during a workout or after when I get home, I am honestly astounded by how different I feel and look.  I can't even imagine feeling how I used to before I began this journey.  I have immense amounts of confidence in comparison to 2 months ago. \n\nI've learned:\n\n- Whining about your problems will accomplish nothing.  It is up to you to fix yourself. \n- It is easier to stop thinking about how hard it will be and just do it.  It is far harder to live unhappily than it is to do the things necessary to be happy.  And the things you do may very well last your life time.\n- What it means to truly dedicate myself to something and that I **CAN** do this\n- What it means to push myself to my limit, and more importantly **respect my limits** (I read this in a post on /fitness once and will never forget it)\n- That getting in better shape is directly correlated to confidence and # of girls who smile at you\n\n\n\n**THANKS**\n\nOnce again, thank you to everyone on this board who takes the time to give advice, post your progress pictures, or encourage others to continue on their journeys.  Everyone who has dedicated themselves to fitness can acknowledge that it is not an easy process, and all of your words and encouragement make it that much easier for me to stay motivated every day.  \n\n**If you have any questions or advice for me regarding my diet or routine I'd love to hear it.**  There are millions of people on here that know more than me, but I feel as though I may have something to offer because I was in your shoes so recently. I've made a lot of progress, but I'm no where near my end goal yet.  I can't wait to keep going!  I'll definitely be looking to post a 6 month update. :P\n\n\n\n**[Some memorable threads that have inspired me over the past 2 months](https://docs.google.com/a/bu.edu/document/d/1gQT2sIPwpAI2QSjvTp7LbDGveT-FumxfORnNVV9rE2I/edit)**  \n\n\n\n\n***edit***\n\nI know I already thanked you guys 10 times, but holy shit.

For most of my life I was morbidly obese. Lost the weight through diet, maintained that for about a year, and now have started focusing on body composition. Over the past 6 months, I worked my ass off in the gym because I love it (all lifting). I know the old adage is that women can't gain like guys do because we don't have the testosterone for it, but that really has not been my experience. Below you'll find my current physique (holiday fluff included) and an old comparison picture showing 3 months of arm growth:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/E1s8J0k\n\nRegardless of any one else's thoughts, I feel like I'm getting a more masculine-looking body (especially upper body) than I'd like to have. The problem is that lifting is my activity of choice, especially in the winter when I can't be outside. It's awesome for my mental health, I love the challenge, and I'm good at it. I also have very severe asthma, so HIIT and any steady state cardio that isn't boring as hell, is pretty excruciating (excuse or not, fitness is a form of self love for me and I don't want to do things I hate). I'm an easy gainer, both of muscle and fat, but a strong, lean, feminine look is what I'm going for.\n\nDiet: I obviously have some more fat I'd like to lose, and I've pared back my diet so that that's on track (high protein, lots of fresh and whole foods. 154p, 115c, 51f). I have eaten at a deficit throughout all of the building except the holidays. I thought maybe I was gaining so quickly because of the high protein, so  i backed off on  that, but when I upped my carbs to compensate, I was hungrier and started leaning towards \"skinny fat\" territory. \n\nTraining: I used to train 6x a week, 2 hours a day, increasing every time. Obviously when my diet was on point, that's a recipe for hypertrophy and I grew (faster than girls \"should,\" apparently. Constantly getting accused of juicing lol). My joints hurt and I was having trouble with recovery, so I switched it up. I cut back on training and started lifting much heavier for fewer sets, but it was during the holidays when I wasn't counting macros and may have been in surplus - another recipe for growth. CURRENTLY, I'm at a caloric deficit, doing short intense lifts (30-40 minutes of full-body lifting in circuits, no rest) in the 3-5 sets/exercise range, 4x a week. \n\nQuestions I have: Would I benefits more from returning to my old split and just doing less weight or fewer sets? It's possible to keep gaining strength without growth, correct? Is my ONLY HOPE cardio? What advice do you have for me or what haven't I considered?\n\nTl;Dr:  I'd like to maintain my upper body (though I honestly won't be sad if I shrink a little) without continuing to gain, and while trimming down a skosh. I want to keep lifting as my primary fit activity because it makes me happy. I eat a high protein diet at a caloric deficit, and right now I'm training full body 4x a week in the low-ish sets range.  Am I doing this shit right? Am I a genetic anomaly? Plz halp\n\nThank you in advance :)", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Slowing the gains; keeping the holistic benefits?", "post_ups": 1643, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ale2g4/slowing_the_gains_keeping_the_holistic_benefits/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:22.273050", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "a_kiss_from_jw", "post_created_utc": 1495899723.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "6doc3e", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 384, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1640, "post_selftext": "I am trying to lose weight and one of the things i struggle to deal with is hunger. if i continue to eat less will my appetite eventually decrease? i know that your stomach doesn't really shrink, but will my appetite start to shrink?\nany advice is appreciated", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "does eating less eventually decrease appetite?", "post_ups": 1640, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/6doc3e/does_eating_less_eventually_decrease_appetite/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:22.273050", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "FrugalFreddy", "post_created_utc": 1550217028.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1550245060.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 1, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "aqub1n", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 1071, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1641, "post_selftext": "Let\u2019s say that most of the drinks you have are low carb ones, for example gin or vodka with club soda, or mixed with lemon/lime juice.  \n**edit** Every 3 nights or so, I have about 5 oz of liquor.

My closest gym is a 20-minute drive away and I work 80 hours a week, so that's prohibitive.  I was able to get a squat rack, bench, and weights for $500 on Amazon.  That's less than I'd pay for a year's membership, and now I can alternate with sets of doing dishes or folding laundry.\n\n(That bit's theoretical; so far it's alternating sets with Reddit.  Need to work on my discipline to get the most out of this!)\n\nIt's a small apartment, so arguably the larger cost is that I've given up having a couch.  I might get an inflatable mattress or something for guests.\n\nI set the rack up yesterday and I'm really delighted, so I thought I'd share with this wonderful community!\n\nhttp://imgur.com/CynzSgy\n\nEDIT: wow, everybody is more interested in the fact that I work 80 hours per week!  I'm a resident physician.  After graduating med school, doctors in the US go through a residency program.  Length ranges from three to seven years, and during that time our work week is *capped* at 80 hours per week, averaged over a month, that we are officially \"on.\"  There may be work that we have to do that we do outside of those hours (like finishing notes).\n\nIt's hard, grueling, and yeah, it's pretty ridiculous when I compare it to the lifestyles other people my age get to enjoy.  For me, my big issue is how much weight I've lost since I started, since when I don't work out I lose weight fast.  I just made a big move and switched programs (I did a prelim year -- the other medical types will understand that), and I'm starting to get my life balance under some semblance of control.\n\nOkay, time to get off Reddit!\n\nPS: went rock-climbing and then for a hike today.  Came back and the bar was still set up for a 65 lb standing shoulder press.  Can you believe the last guy didn't rerack the weights?  Ah well, at least it's my overhead press weight anyway, so I can just do that.  Grabbed the bar, went to press, and... nope!  It's not going anywhere.\n\nAmazing how wrecked you are the day after your first real workout in months.  I'm looking forward to getting back in shape!\n\nEDIT: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3mls56/home_gym_500/cvg32b1 for the links to the Amazon pages for everything.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Home gym: $500", "post_ups": 1644, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3mls56/home_gym_500/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:22.273050", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "kuma_shock", "post_created_utc": 1435955728.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1436036767.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "3c168v", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 491, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1641, "post_selftext": "[tl;dr pic](https://i.imgur.com/dG7Q7UZ.jpg)\n\n[Full Album](http://imgur.com/a/GMvlO)\n\n[Relaxed](http://i.imgur.com/aUGb0vH.jpg)\n\nStats: M/28/5'6\" [122lbs > 132lbs = +10lbs] (3 years)\n\n**Routine:**\n\nStarted with Starting Strength for a few months until I started to plateau.\nSwitched to German Volume Training for a few months but decided I wanted to gain strength again.\nSwitched to PHAT and have really liked it since.

Basically I make sure I'm getting a decent distribution between fats/carbs/proteins (also take a multi-vitamin to help with micros, and make sure you have at least one source of fiber). Use a website like myfitnesspal or fatsecret to track what you eat and make sure it lines up with your goals. When bulking/cutting slowly add/remove calories to meet your weight goals while trying to keep a good macro balance.\n\n\nWhen bulking, I'd drink my protein shakes with whole milk instead of water, snack more, and have more cheat meals. As a vegetarian who is also hopeless in the kitchen, I worked my way up to 5 scoops of whey protein a day to meet my protein goals at my heaviest 162lbs (1g protein per pound of body weight).\n\n\nCutting is the opposite, these last few pounds have really taken dedication. I can remember only one cheat meal in the past two months. Currently consuming 1250 calories daily to get to my current weight, I'm already plateauing on the weight loss and will likely end at 131lbs... but I think I'm ok with that and I don't think I could handle eating any less calories, I'll go back to eating more soon.\n\n\n**Supplements:**\n\n* Creatine\n* ON Gold Standard whey protein\n* Orange Triad multi-vitamin\n* NOW Omega-3 fish oil\n* NOW Vitamin D\n* 1 caffeine pill for pre-workout\n\n\nFeel free to ask any questions, I'm sure I left some stuff out.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/3c0tat/m2856_122lbs_132lbs_10lbs_3_years_skinnyfat_to/", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "3 year progress, Skinny-fat to near goal physique (r/progresspics xpost)", "post_ups": 1641, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3c168v/3_year_progress_skinnyfat_to_near_goal_physique/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:22.273050", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "DaAzn", "post_created_utc": 1475987431.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1476043301.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "56krq7", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 241, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1640, "post_selftext": "Backstory:\nLong story short I was fat, called fat, lost weight and got big.

I don't have any pictures from this time on my computer, but I started lifting in highschool.  Prior to that, I was fairly scrawny,  about 115 lbs/52 kg at 5'8\"/173 cm.  I started with some friends, doing full body workouts [mostly machines] a couple days a week and never paid attention to diet.  Within a year or so, I had gained 35lbs/16 kg and looked much better.  Over the next year I gained a few more lbs., likely due to drinking several times a week:\n\n[Me at 155 lbs/70.5 kg](http://i.imgur.com/qShOmx4.jpg)\n\nI stayed like this for the most part over the next 7-8 years, getting a little bigger and staying at about the same leanness.  I lifted on and off the whole time, following a bro-split - Chest/Tris, Back/Bis, Legs/Shoulders.\n\nA couple years ago, my girlfriend asked me to bring her to the gym, so I tried putting together an actual routine and bulking diet, mainly using info I compiled from bodybuilding.com.  It was another bro-split, four days a week, basically putting arms on their own day and adding bench, squats and barbell rows in addition to machines.  Our form on these exercises was terrible, making it easier by not using a full range of motion. Regardless, I was able to put on a substantial amount of size.  My diet was probably about 3000 kcal/day on the weekdays, eating chicken, vegetables, brown rice, sweet potatoes, etc...  On the weekends, I continued to drink heavily and eat whatever I wanted, leading to a lot of fat gain as well:\n\n[Dream Bulk - 183 lbs/83 kg](http://imgur.com/a/v7b95)\n\nI wasn't thrilled with the amount of fat I gained, but overeating let me get much bigger and stronger over the 6 months I bulked.  I learned about the keto diet and figured that would be a good way to get cut.  I put together a half-assed 5x5 routine and followed these macros:\n\n1800 kcal/day - p=150g/c=25g/f=122g\n\nThis got me down to about 160 lbs in 3.5 months.  After a month of trying to lift heavy, I found myself with no energy in the gym.  I tried adding a \"refeed\" on Saturdays, eating 500+g of carbs.  This made me feel like shit on Sunday and Monday, so I started doing the targeted keto diet, eating 20g of dextrose [smarties, runts, etc...] right before my workout.  It helped, but my strength had plummeted and though I looked much better, I think I lost a lot of the muscle I had gained and was not nearly as lean as I had expected for losing almost 25 lbs/11 kg:\n\n[Keto Cut - 160 lbs/73 kg](http://imgur.com/a/8pXW9)\n\nBy this point, I realized that if I got strong, I would be able to put on muscle much faster.  I learned about Stronglifts here, and decided to give it a shot.  I worked on my form and then started at the following weights:\n\nSquat- 185 lbs/84 kg for 5x5, 1RM at 225 lbs/102 kg.\n\nBench - 115 lbs/52 kg for 5x5, 1RM at 145 lbs/66 kg.\n\nRow - 90 lbs/41 kg for 5x5, 1RM at 125 lbs/57 kg.\n\nPress - 45 lbs/20 kg for 5x5, 1RM at 70 lbs/32 kg.\n\nDeadlift - 185 lbs/84 kg for 1x5, 1RM at 230 lbs/105 kg.\n\nI followed the program exactly, and saw my strength go up consistently.  I calculated my TDEE at 2300 and tried to eat just over that keeping protein and carbs fairly high.  I ate clean, cut down on my drinking but still had beers on the weekend.  I started in January of 2014, and by May I had the following numbers:\n\nSquat- 250 lbs/113 kg for 5x5, 1RM at 285 lbs/130 kg.\n\nBench - 165 lbs/75 kg for 5x5, 1RM at 195 lbs/89 kg.\n\nRow - 145 lbs/66 kg for 5x5, 1RM at 170 lbs/77 kg.\n\nPress - 85 lbs/38.5 kg for 5x5, 1RM at 100 lbs/45.5 kg.\n\nDeadlift - 295 lbs/134 kg for 1x5, 1RM at 330 lbs/150 kg.\n\nAt this point I threw my back out leaning backwards doing press. I decided that cutting calories while I rested would be the best plan.  TERRIBLE IDEA, if you are injured, rest and eat at or slightly above maintenance.  I lost a decent amount of muscle, and my lifts suffered when I finally came back in mid-September.  \n\nI decided I wanted to bulk, anticipating my strength and muscle would come back quickly.  I did not want to go through the tedious process of using Stronglifts again, so I found phrak's greyskull and decided to give that a try.  I started at weights lower than I did with Stronglifts.  I loved the AMRAP sets, and the fact that if I hit 10 reps I could jump ahead in weight.  I bulked using the following macros:\n\nTraining Days - 3000 kcal/day - p=250g/c=350g/f=67g\n\nRest Days - 2450 kcal/day - p=250g/c=125g/f=106g\n\nI added some accessory exercises on my last workout of the week, figuring the 2 rest days would help me continue adding strength.  By December, I had gotten up to 175 lbs/80 kg, and my lifts had surpassed where they were previously:\n\nSquat- 275 lbs/125 kg for 3x5, 1RM at 305 lbs/138.5 kg.\n\nBench - 195 lbs/88.5 kg for 3x5, 1RM at 220 lbs/100 kg.\n\nRow - 170 lbs/77 kg for 3x5, 1RM at 195 lbs/88.5 kg.\n\nPress - 100 lbs/45.5 kg for 3x5, 1RM at 115 lbs/52 kg.\n\nDeadlift - 315 lbs/143 kg for 1x4, 1RM at 355 lbs/161 kg.\n\nChinups - +25 lbs/+11 kg for 3x5, 1RM not tested.\n\n[After Stronglifts/Greyskull - 175 lbs/79 kg](http://imgur.com/a/ALCL2)\n\nIn January of this year I started a leangains style cut, switching to a very low volume Reverse Pyramid routine, focusing on the big lifts.  I found that if you can maintain or even gain strength during a cut, muscle loss will be minimal.  My routine looked like this:\n\nTues [Pull]\n\nDeadlift - 1 set 3-5 reps, 1 backoff set of 10% less weight, + 1 rep.\n\nChinups - 1 set of 5-8 reps, 1 backoff set of 10% less weight added, + 1 rep.\n\nPendlay Row - 2x5\n\nCurls - 2x10\n\nThu [Push]\n\nBench- 1 set 4-6 reps, 1 backoff set of 10% less weight, + 1 rep.\n\nDips - 1 set of 5-8 reps, 1 backoff set of 10% less weight added, + 1 rep.\n\nDumbbell Incline Press- 2x5\n\nCable Pushdown - 2x10\n\nSat [Legs]\n\nSquat - 1 set 4-6 reps, 1 backoff set of 10% less weight, + 1 rep.\n\nOHP - 1 set of 4-6 reps, 1 backoff set of 10% less weight, + 1 rep.\n\nBarbell Lunges - 2x5\n\nRomanian Deadlift - 2x5\n\nIf I consistently missed the rep range, I deloaded and worked back up.  If I hit the top of the rep range, I added weight.  It was tough, but my lifts actually went up a little bit on this routine:\n\nSquat- 280 lbs/127 kg x6, 1RM at 315 lbs/143 kg.\n\nBench - 205 lbs/93 kg x4, 1RM at 230 lbs/104.5 kg.\n\nRow - 170 lbs/77 kg x5, 1RM at 195 lbs/88.5 kg.\n\nPress - 105 lbs/48 kg x5, 1RM at 120 lbs/54.5 kg.\n\nDeadlift - 320 lbs/145.5 kg for 1x5, 1RM at 365 lbs/166 kg.\n\nChinups - +45 lbs/+20 kg x7, 1RM at +85 lbs/+38.5 kg.\n\nDips - +45 lbs/+20 kg x8, 1RM at +90 lbs/+41 kg.\n\nI fasted on rest days, 16 hours between my dinner the night before and my lunch the next day.  I did a lot of low intensity cardio, as well as some hiking and mountain biking fasted as well.  My Diet looked like this:\n\nTraining Days - 2400 kcal/day - p=200g/c=250g/f=66g\n\nRest Days - 1800 kcal/day - p=175g/c=100g/f=77g\n\nIt took me about 8 months because I stopped cutting a couple times.  I hurt my back shoveling snow in February and took a month off, I had a death in the family in April and took a couple weeks off, and threw my back out on squats [minor] in late may and took a couple weeks off again.  Despite these set backs, eating at maintenance and keeping my diet in check kept things going right.  I took the following pictures a few weeks ago:\n\n[Leangains Cut - 154 lbs/70 kg](http://imgur.com/a/5OVFo)\n\nOverall, I'm pretty happy with the results.  I wanted to get a bit leaner, but I don't want to get below 150 lbs, so I've been eating at maintenance the last few weeks.  I'll bulk again in a month or so with a higher volume routine [phul or something like that].\n\nThings I learned are do not cut when you aren't lifting, you will lose muscle.  Take time off when you're hurt.  I jumped into Greyskull when my back was still beat and I had ongoing pain until April of this year.  To get rid of it, I started stretching a lot - the night before a training session and right after lifting.  WORK on MOBILITY, you won't regret it.  \n\nFinally, bulking/cutting when you are just starting is stupid.  Get your main lifts up to intermediate levels before you even worry about this.  Get strong and you'll have the muscle to cut to.  I honestly wish I had more muscle to cut to, but that is a project for another year.  I consider getting in shape a long term project, it takes a while, especially when you are not a kid anymore.

Basically, it states that certain theories, like people's 'lack of willpower' to eat healthy and an evolutionary mismatch between our current environment and the ability to store food in the face of scarce resources, are not enough to explain food cravings and obesity like it was previously believed. \n\nInstead, food cravings are mainly caused by an evolutionary mismatch between people and the bacteria that live in their gut; certain gut bacteria process certain nutrients better, leading to a power-struggle between them in which the dominant bacteria 'hijack' the neural axis between the brain and the gut and, in turn, influence us to eat the food products that contain these nutrients.\n\n This is an important paradigm shift in our understanding of human eating behaviors, as it suggests that obesity isn't a result of an evolutionary mismatch between the humans and their external environment, but rather, a mismatch between the human body and the beings that live within the environment of which it is itself made.\n\nI am truly amazed by this. \n\nP.S.: if you want to gain insight into the subject, don't just read my short summary posted here. Read the article itself. It is far more complicated than just what I've said in my original post. \n\nedit: I've realized that people have interpreted this as being an excuse to not eat properly and work hard in the gym. This article certainly isn't suggesting that, and neither am I by posting it. It is not my intention to give people an excuse to not do their best. Like some people have stated, this articles merely looks at the 'why's' of people have food cravings. I found it genuinely interesting and wanted to share this with you guys, as it relates to nutrition and fitness. That's it. \n\nedit 2: I really wish I could re-do the title. I apologize for this title. \n\nedit 3: This thread really exploded, I can't keep up with all the answers anymore. :/\n\nHowever, I have read almost all of them, and I would like to address a few points. Firstly, I cannot apologize enough for the biased and somewhat misleading title. I would re-do it if I could, I assure you. Secondly, the idea of 'willpower' is never actually mentioned by the authors. They talk about how some scientists have argued that there is no 'self-control', in that the 'self' as we understand it doesn't actually exist, and is instead merely a set of highly contextualized cognitive responses based on fluctuations in brain activity. Another [study](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn_a_00650#.VJ9gB14CA) not mentioned by the authors of this article also found this. This is essentially where my idea on 'lack of willpower' comes from, but it is merely my interpretration. But as you can see, the idea is problematic in itself, as things like 'free will', 'self' and 'self-control' are hot topics within the scientific community. Thirdly, and most importantly, the author states that self-control ALONE cannot explain why we have cravings. This is where I messed up really badly in my title: I should have added the word 'alone'. The authors' main point is that previously prevalent theories on lack of self-control and evolutionary mismatch between humans and their external environment are not enough to explain food cravings; instead, they are primarily stemmed from a power struggle between bacteria in people's own gut. \n\nAgain, I am sorry for messing up the title. But I still think this article is definitly worth reading and discussing extensively.

This one examined hip and thigh muscle activity between full squats, parallel squats, and front squats in trained women. Cliff notes: Deeper squats below parallel do not lead to greater glute activation (this is in conflict with Caterisano et al. 2002, but I have pointed out that this study had serious flaws - Chris Beardsley and Clark et al. 2010 pointed this out too). There really isn't much of a difference in hip and thigh muscle activity between the different squat variations we tested. Here's the PubMed [link](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26252837).  \n  \nGreg Nuckols of Stengtheory (/u/gnuckols) had some interesting comments to summarize (on his own Facebook post):  \n  \n> 4 major takeaways:  \n  \n> 1) a squat is a squat is a squat. Muscle activation between all three variations (and yes, between front and back squats) is very similar. If you're just squatting to generally improve leg and hip strength, it really doesn't matter how you squat. If you squat because the squat is part of your sport (powerlifting) then squat in whatever manner allows you to lift the most weight. If you squat because the squat has really substantial carryover to your sport (weightlifting) then squat in the manner than has the most carryover.  \n\n> 2) can we please bury the myth you have to squat ass to grass because hamstrings co-contraction will protect your knees, but only if you bounce your ass off your ankles? Also, the myth that if your knees track forward at all, they will explode and you will die (for similar reasons - if your knees track forward, required hip extension torque will be lower, so you're hamstrings won't contract as much, so your knees will implode). Hamstrings co-contraction took place to the same degree regardless of depth (they didn't test above parallel squats, but the prior, albeit flawed, study found that the same applied to half squats as well) and regardless of bar position.  \n\n> 3) the squat works your glutes and quads WAY harder than it works your hamstrings. With a 10rm load, peak glute and quad activation are really high, along with average quad activation. Hamstrings? Not too much going on there. I've written quite a bit about why that's the case, and why you'd want that to be the case.  \n\n> 4) you can't look at muscle activation and try to extrapolate hypertrophy from it directly. Deeper squats have been shown to cause more hypertrophy, but that's not reflected (in any meaningful way) via the EMG results. Range of motion (particularly stretch, which may cause some hypertrophy signaling by itself. Also, muscles are more prone to damage in the stretched position) also plays a major role.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Deeper squats below parallel do not lead to greater glute activation.

But perhaps, even more critical to whether or not a person will meet their fitness goals is their mental state and expectations. If people choose not to go to the gym because they have wrong expectations, or are feeling certain negative things that they think are exclusive to them, then all the diets and routines in the world won\u2019t matter. \n\nI\u2019d love for people to share how they transformed mentally throughout getting into fitness and break down what others could expect. I think it definitely could help others know what is common to feel mentally and have people realize \u201coh I\u2019m not alone in feeling a bit down or confused, others had the same experience initially.\u201d\n\nIn my case: \n\nI made a video going through my mental journey and encouraging others not to give up: [Video Link](https://youtu.be/dNDzAdLe0Gw?t=1m28s)\n\nBasically this is my mental progression:\n\n**Month 1:**\n\nWhen I first got into lifting, I couldn\u2019t even bench the bar. I was quite embarrassed to go to the gym. I loved to go at night under the excuse that machines / weights will be free, but really I didn\u2019t want to be watched. \n\nThe first month definitely was the toughest, my body was super sore, I didn\u2019t see any results and there are many times that I wanted quit. Though, I can definitely say I\u2019m extremely glad I didn\u2019t.\n\n**Month 2-3:**\n\nMy confidence started to grow, I wasn\u2019t as concerned about others observing me anymore. It was still rather tough to go to the gym consistently. The results were starting to come, so naturally I did want to see where they\u2019d go. But mentally, I was still uncertain and there were still quite a few times I remember where I wanted to say screw it and stop going to the gym (especially when I discovered atg squats). \n\n**Month 3-12:**\n\nOnce the physical changes started to kick in, oh sweet baby jesus...Going to the gym actually became fun and addicting. During this time I changed a lot mentally, I realized that it\u2019s actually possible to drastically change how you look. I became much more confident in my body and also my strength. Not to mention when people notice your changes or tell you they respect your effort it\u2019s amazing and instills pride in what you\u2019ve done.\n\n**Month 12-24:**\n\nOver the last year I\u2019ve just become extremely confident both with my body and with going to the gym in general. The gym kind of feels like my dojo in a way, when I go there I know what to do, I see familiar faces and it\u2019s a positive environment. I really think that this is the good part of fitness, becoming mentally stronger, more confident, gaining the respect of your peers, and healthier. It\u2019s the complete opposite of my first three months.\n\nDefinitely would recommend to keep pushing through if you are just starting out, or if you\u2019ve been away from the gym but want to come back. \n\nWould love to hear how you guys transformed too. \n\n**edit: Super happy I made this thread, you guys have posted so many ridiculously amazing and inspiring stories.

Also, I don't do the same workout in consecutive weeks. For example my next leg day may look like this:\n\n  *Leg Extensions*\n\n  1 drop set 100 reps\n\n  *(Superset) Barbell Squat*\n\n  1 warm up set 8-10 reps\n\n  3 sets 6-8 reps\n\n  *(Superset) Standing Hamstring Curl*\n\n  3 sets 15 reps\n\n  *Dead Lift*\n\n  2 sets to failure\n\n  So there you have it.

Long story short I decided I didn't want to be a statistic, or a fat sloth father to my daughter who wouldn't even be able to keep up with her getting older. Researched proper nutrition, starting going to gym. OCD really kicked in and I wanted to know everything. I have the personality that if i do something or take on a new hobby I have to be all-in. I learned that there is tons of mis-information on the internet and you have to dig through it all to get the real answers. Over the past two years I have gone from 205 to 162, bulk to 190, cut to 172 in Sept of 2015[picture of cut from 192 to 172 September of last year](https://scontent.fash1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/10994068_10153105954413176_205172773828230278_n.jpg?oh=5a7f22a554e04f00d705a99e64a031c1&oe=57AFCDBF), then bulk to 203, sort of dieted a week to get to 194.9 for the meet. \n\nI suffer from pretty severe anxiety and I noticed that lifting was a huge stress reliever and anxiety reducer. It is a very good form of therapy for me, something i truly enjoy. And it also fits my obsessive, calculated personality by following percentages , numbers, etc.\n\n**Training & Programming**\n\nI originally started out with Strong Lifts back in the day. Once plateaued I took up a pretty basic Powerlifting program from my good friend, it was something like three week waves of hyper, then strength, re-start. Just to see if i would adhere or enjoy. Turns out I am a very calculated, OCD individual so, i was hooked. \n\nI started making my own programming after reading many strength science and exercise phys text books, and then especially in the end Scientific Principals of Strength Training by Dr. Mike Isratel and CWS. \n\nI totaled 1065 (375/255/435) in the gym in one years time from May 2014 to May 2015. Took another month off and restarted training from June 2015 until April 2016. \n\nThis program was three months of work capacity/accumulation using somewhat auto-regulation, but fairly linear approach to loading. Bar weight and volume increases each week. Three months of strength using four week waves and one-deload. Squat maybe twice per week, deadlift once, and bench twice. usually four days, sometimes an extra saturday here and there.\n\nPeaking was four weeks long, tapering until week of meet where i hit singles on sq bn dl on the same day 50-70% on sq/dl and 55-80% on bench. rested thur-fri, meet saturday. Training maxes were setup initially as my last maxes in May2015. However as i progressed i would take a \"skills test day\" and depending on the phase i would run either a 8 or 3-5rep max. This inflated my training maxes to 420sq 300bench 470 deadlift.\n\nI entered this meet just continuing to fill out my frame, so I knew id be between weight classes, Im fairly fluffy around 18-19% bf currently, so if i actually did a cut i would probably be able to compete @ 181. Goal was to just go in at whatever weight i was, try to hit 1200+ Or between 1215-1280 (class 1 total 181/198) within two years since I first touched a barbell.\n\n**Squats**\n\n* **1st attempt squat**, [407lbs 185kg](https://www.instagram.com/p/BEmmOQjzJOv/?taken-by=theyambor), smashed it, however head judge said i jumped the rack command, and one person said depth, oh well, questionable. \n\n* **2nd attempt** [424.4 192.5kg](https://www.instagram.com/p/BEmmU0KTJO7/?taken-by=theyambor), this was quite fast as well, I didn't let the previous red lights bother me..\n\n* **3rd attempt** [446.4 202.5kg](https://www.instagram.com/p/BEmmaRzzJPF/?taken-by=theyambor), this was relatively quick i believe. I had my friend picking attempts as he has much more experience than me and he was more on the side of just get a total and gain confidence, however I was on the side of pushing it. I think i left a 460 or so squat on the platform. oh well. I had tripled 420 in training so im pretty sure it was there.\n\n**Bench**\n\nBeen battling a nagging shoulder issue for the past two months, mainly bursitis and some bicep issues. This started to creep up after squats. What sucks was is that I had a ton of volume programmed in as i wanted my bench to play catch up and was pushing for 315bench This was going great until a few months ago, needless to say...it didn't happen. \n\n* **1st attempt** 275.6 125kg, felt decent, three whites. \n* **2nd attempt** [292.1 132.5kg](https://youtu.be/DdbwCloPTLw), started feeling it really bad in the shoulder, affecting any drive, bar path already messed up, still, three whites..\n* **3rd attempt** 297.7, missed. After seeing the video of 292,we both agreed today it was not there, so only a 5lb jump on the third attempt, mis-grooved..pretty bad pain..Entire meet video for bench.\n\n**Deadlifts**\n\nI only deadlift once a week, usually just a ton of volume, not much variation besides in work capacity block where i did mainly deficits.\n\n* **1st attempt** [451.9 205kg](https://www.instagram.com/p/BEmmq4yTJPl/?taken-by=theyambor) This was too easy. oops, three whites.\n\n* **2nd attempt** [474 215kg](https://www.instagram.com/p/BEmmzGVzJP5/?taken-by=theyambor), this was easy as well..three whites.\n\n* **3rd attempt** [496 225kg](https://www.instagram.com/p/BEmm51xzJAD/?taken-by=theyambor). I was so focused this day, i was in the mood, I still had him pick the attempt, however I should have had input and made sure it was 501 or 507...left some on the platform, however 3/3 deads, 9 white lights. Playing the game of the first meet\n and gaining confidence or just going for it was in our heads all day. Ended up with a second place in the 198 open raw.\n\n**TL;DR**: was fat and lazy AF. changed life.started powerlifting, totaled 1065 in one year. Started lifting again after a month break, added 170lbs to lifts in 11 months. Took second place in the 198 open, Totaled 1,235 560kg @ 88.45kg in first meet within two years of first touching a barbell. went  7/9 22/27 white lights. Went from 205 to 162, bulk to 190, cut to 172, bulk to 203 March 2016, about two years time in total. Now I am obsessed with strength science, bio-chemistry and exercise phys and oh yea, powerlifting... [Sweet meet video,not really, showing all lifts.](https://youtu.be/DdbwCloPTLw) I hope this post and comments turn out to be very motivating to many individuals, men and women. Once i really found out how much BS is within the fitness community, I really just want to help others succeed.\n\nI have some serious thanks to give to my good friend David Flees. He was basically my handler all day. He allowed me to just focus on what i needed to do as i practically had my headphones in all day long. I did not have to worry about selections, how many were in front of me in my flight, or when to warm up. This made a world of difference not knowing what the actual bar weight was, i just went up there and did it. I never once looked at the weights trying to add them or the bar loading screen. Also my wife for putting up with me and my obsessive behavior over the past training cycles, making food over the past two years for meal prep, and for dedicating her time for me to train..\n\nfor those that are [interested programming can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DSkXY2zfkt0gwQe8hbaKvc0Bpnau3d7_7LTwKJjL6-o/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n\nand a [sweet attempt selection sheet i made here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lOQoW_Q1ax3F5qzS5leb6shm8rQA-hL4FrpcmMIR-xI/edit?usp=sharing) instructions are on top. I'm guessing you can copy and paste to your sheets and use?\n\n\n**Future Goals**\nGoing to go on little cut to get into the 180's maybe 12-13%bf. Then continue to fill out my frame, compete again probably in the 198 maybe find a meet towards winter. Going for a Master total (1355-1436) by this month 2017 , and hopefully there will be another Mid-Atlantic Classic at that time.. thanks all for your responses!\n\n**Common Questions Asked In Comments**\n\n**age/height** 28 5'11\n\n**What books did you reference for strength training?**\n\n* science and practice of strength training by Vladimir Zatsiorsky\n* supertraining by yuri verkhoshansky\n* periodization for sports by bompa \n* periodization 5th edition by bompa\n* scientific principals of strength training by Dr Mike Isratel and CWS\n\n**what was your calorie.macro's for cutting?**\n\nstarted around 2500kcal initial cut, down to about 1850 just under BMR. Went into Ketosis for about 2 months during initial cut.\n\nThis cut will be around the same, macro's will be 221p/212c/83 fat. Will end cut once i get near or under BMR or 10-13% depending on what month i'm in. Im more interested in filling out my frame and getting stronger than being super lean at the moment. \n\n**Aesthetics**\nI've always been a function over form person. I'd rather actually lift the weights and perform, than just look the part. I don't necessarily care about one body part in particular. However, This does not mean that I don't want to be sub 10% fat one day. But my goals are just to continue getting bigger and stronger, as the more time you spend cutting ,the less time you spend getting bigger and or stronger. \n\n**Why lift weights? Depression/Anxiety & Lifestyle**\nLifting changed my life. Not only physicially, but mentally and socially. Like i said before lifting for me is the best therapy there is. No magic pills prescribed from the doctor could ever match it. Being physically fit and active is one of the best \"medicines\" there ever was. \n\nI guess ill put this out there that in 2013 up to around 2014 I was prescribed paxil, then lexapro for depression/anxiety. I hated the way these made me feel, and I was like 25, what was i doing on these types of SSRI's? This also led to even more weight gain on top of my already horrible diet. \n\nI was also battling pre-diabetes and high cholesterol. Everyone always wants to run to the Dr, and say \"hey, cant you just prescribe me another pill?\" Don't go this route, you more than likely don't need statins, **what you really need is activity and a change of lifestyle**. Fix the root cause of the issue, don't rely on pills to just cover up the real issues at hand. This will save you and your family money and precious time. Don't get me wrong ,medicine is a beautiful thing when it comes to life threatening diseases and serious complications. However, most of the trips that we make to the pharmacy can all be combated by changing your life. Less time on the couch with sodas and chips, and more time feeding your body proper nutrition and becoming active. \n\n**IF people only knew the correlation between how they feel and the foods they put in their body**\n\n*This is an analogy i made awhile back i like to give people \"your body like your vehicle, is in every way a machine. You need to fuel it (eating) and tune it properly (training) and do proper recovery for maximum performance. In terms of nutrition think when you're at the gas station, you dont fill up with diesel when your vehicle runs on gasoline right? Treat your body the same, it was not meant for you to fuel it with garbage or entirely the wrong fuel. Choose the most nutritious foods most of the time and eat according to your activity level. Your body will reward you. While the human body is a resilent machine, machines do fail. And years of abuse from alcohol, drugs, FOOD, stress and no sleep, it will breakdown and fail completely.*\n\n **why live the only life you have to live so poorly and short? Your body is a super high performance machine. Treat it correctly,  Train.Eat well. Sleep. Love life.**\n ", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "From 205 and man boobs to Powerlifting and strength science obsession: My two year Journey.", "post_ups": 1619, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4gdpit/from_205_and_man_boobs_to_powerlifting_and/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:22.277308", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "", "post_created_utc": 1432480632.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1432542710.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "373is8", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 310, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1622, "post_selftext": "First time I had a proper look at myself at the mirror without being disappointed.\nAfter years of being underweight (56kg at 178cm) I think I made progress which wasn't possible for me , or so I thought. I'm now standing at a solid 73kg after a year of meticulous lifting. I actually just started crying when I couldn't feel my bone beneath my progress. Thank you guys, you in a large part were responsible for what I achieved up to this point.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR ALL THE POSITIVE RESPONSES ! :D \n\nEdit:\nSince a lot of people are asking about my routine I will outline it below. Keep in mind I am a Uni Student, I got plenty of time outside normal drinking and fucking around. This progress took me from November 2014 to May 2015 , 73kg is my last stable and persistent weight. I am currently 21.\nI attended my local gym run by a ex army fitness Sargent for 4 days a week a and 2-3h a day depending how long i took between my sets. I worked out 4 days a week , and used a typical newbie split routine. I combined chest/shoulder, bicep/back, tricep/leg. This is the routine I was consistently doing once I managed to hit a stride where I was capable of carrying out the exercises at a reasonable pace and weight. Before that it only varied by one or two exercises. I do a variety of core exercises each day as a warm up.\n\nChest\n\n* Bench Press (Barbell) 4x10\n* Pulley Crossover 4x10\n* Flyes (Dumbel) 4x10\n* Chest Press (Dumbel) 4x10\n* Push Ups 4x20\n\nBack\n\n* Bench Pull (Dumbel) 4x10\n* One Arm Pull (Dumbel) 4x10\n* Seated Rowing 4x10\n* Lat Pulldown 4x10\n* Behind the Neck Lat Pull Down 4x10\n\nLeg\n\n* Squat or Leg Press (Smith machine , no squat rack ): )  4x10\n* Calf Raises (Smith Machine) 4x15\n* Leg Extension (Machine) 4x10\n* Kickback (Machine) 4x10\n* Lounges (Dumbell) 4x15 (Each Leg)\n\nBiceps \n\n* Preacher Curl 4x10 (Each arm)\n* Positive Curl 4x10 (Each arm) ( I think you guys call it a concentrated curl?)\n* Hammer Curls 4x10 \n* Incline Curls 4x10\n* Z bar Curls 4x10\n\nTriceps \n\n* Tricep Push downs 4x10\n* Donkey Kicks (Tricep Extensions?) 4x10 (Each Arm)\n* Skull Crushers 4x10\n* Dips 4x15\n* Seated Tricep Press 4x10\n\nShoulder \n\n* Shrugs 4x10 (Dumbbell or Barbell)\n* Deltoid Rise 4x10 (Dumbell)\n* Incline Shoulder Rise 4x10 (Dumbbell)\n* Incline Military shoulder press 4x10 (Machine) \n\nNow Food wise I have two protein shakes a day on workout days for pre and post work out. This is to achieve the 4500 calorie intake on workout days and 3800 calories on non workout days.  I got myself Matrix Nutrition 5kg tub Whey Complex. I mixed this with the recomended 300ml of semi-skimmed milk.\n\nFor breakfast I would eat eggs, whole 400g tub of greek style yoghurt with granola and a sandwich if I felt like it. \n\nI eat everything and anything from the reduced section. I get support from my parents plus the loans, bursaries I received for the particular course I am doing have enabled me to diversify what I eat and how much of it I can eat. The basic advice I can give is to diversify your cooking by as much as possible , if you got a good amount of spices mixes sauces etc. its quite easy to switch and not become bored of eating. One day I would eat polish pork schabowy and the next I could eat a stir fry or Moroccan couscous with chick peas and chicken .\n\nWith the amount of food I was eating it was important for me to also maintain a good digestive system, I swapped out coffee and black tea for green tea and mint tea plus having a lot of fibre in my diet. I also casually drink milk on a regular basis. \n\nInitially I found it extremely hard to eat large quantities of food. But I found that gradually increasing your portion sizes is the best way to go, then supplementing it with \"deserts\" such as Greek yoghurt with granola, or (Polish unsalted) cottage cheese with some jam. \n\nEDIT NUMERO DUO:\n\nI forgot to add , two weeks ago I switched programs . Now what I'm doing a power circuit according to my gym coach.\n\nDay 1,3\n\n* 6x12 Deadlift (Barbell)\n* 6x12 Bench Press (Smith Machine\n* 6x12 Squats (Smith Machine)\n\nDay 2,4\n\n* 6x12 Cleans (Barbell)\n* 6x12 Overhead Shoulder Press (Smith Machine)\n* 6x12 Upright Rowing (Barbell)\n\nEdit 3:\nThank you for the constructive criticism regarding my volume of exercise. I will take everything into consideration and discuss it with my gym coach, or what ever we should call him. \n\nLast and Final Edit:\nThank you for all the criticism and support. I taken it all into consideration and will discuss it with a trainer to more streamline and focus my routine. Also apologises for bad grammar or spellings. English is a secondary language. \n\nEdit 5:\nSo I just woke up. I will try to respond to everything. People have been saying that parts of the post have been removed. Not sure what happened. I did not remove anything. Im guessing that progress pictures might be counted as relevant information .Regarding my initial program and diet. Yes it was crazy. And yes I realise it was most likely too much. When I first posted this, this was a simple thank you.

Also before I discovered manscaping. :) I had to go back pretty far to find a shirtless pic of me, but rest assured that this is roughly what I've looked like for the past couple decades.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRight: A couple weeks ago, days after I turned 42. I'm about 160 pounds and 12 weeks into my current bulk. The image is kind of a double cheat, since the photo is post-workout and with flattering light, but it's the first time I've ever seen myself in a photo and been really happy with the way I looked, so I'm using it! :)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Here is a \"fairer\" image](https://imgur.com/BUIPrB9) (eg: no post-workout pump & not posed) of my semi-current physique, taken 3 months ago, near the bottom of my most recent cut.\n\n*****\n\n# Background\nI'm a 5'10\", 160 lb guy that just turned 42 a couple weeks ago. I rarely see progress posts from older people, so hopefully some of you 40+ folks will see this and post your own stories; I'd love to see them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDuring my 20s and 30s, I mostly sat in front of a computer for 8+ hours a day, rarely exercised, and never really paid any attention to my diet. As a result, my weight slowly ballooned from about 155 in my early 20s, to ~190 at my peak in my early 30s. At 190 lbs, a helpful friend pointed out that I was fat (it happened slowly and I honestly couldn't see it), and I was able to bring my weight back down to a more reasonable 175 relatively quickly through cardio and programs like P90X. I never attempted to adjust my diet because I believed that exercise was the key to weight loss.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThroughout my 30s and early 40s, I hovered around 175 lbs, where I basically looked \"fine\" - at least with a shirt on, anyway. I knew I was out of shape, but I had neither the motivation nor knowledge to make changes to my physique.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI started taking my health more seriously when I hit 40, and I took up running. I've always been a terrible runner, and had awful shin splints when first starting out. It took me several weeks to get to the point where I could run a single mile at a ridiculous 12-13 minute pace, but I was ecstatic at the time. I stuck with it, and over the next year I worked my way up to ~30 miles per week. My 5K mile pace was down to about 7:20 and I felt **really** good about myself. I felt fit for the first time since my teenage years!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEven then, my physique hadn't changed much. I'd dropped a few pounds, but I still had a decent belly and no muscle to speak of - I was pretty much the definition of skinny fat.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEverything changed just over a year ago, in October 2017. I was visiting a friend that happened to be into bodybuilding, and I agreed to join him for a workout. Until that day, I had never touched a barbell in my life. The most I'd ever done with weights was some curls with light dumbbells in my living room while watching TV.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat day was a **serious** wake-up call. I had always assumed that I was about average as far as strength went, but on that day I discovered that I was weak **AF**! My friend took me through the big 4 lifts, and the only one that I didn't feel completely embarrassed by was squats, where I able to successfully complete 4x12 reps with the empty bar, although I seriously struggled. I could only overhead press the empty bar for 3-4 reps, and had to drop down to something like 12.5 pound dumbbells to get a full 12. Similarly, I could only bench the empty bar for maybe 5-6 reps. It was a real shitshow!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat's the day that I decided I needed some muscles. So I jumped into weightlifting.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR version:** Was skinny-fat for all of my adult life, realized I was also weak af recently, decided to change!\n\n*****\n\n#Training\nAs an absolute beginner, I stumbled onto this subreddit and found the [recommended workout routines](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/recommended_routines). I thought I'd give the [dumbbell stopgap](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/zc0uy/a_beginner_dumbbell_program_the_dumbbell_stopgap/) routine a try for 2-3 months, because I already had a set of adjustable dumbbells, and I wasn't yet sure if I wanted to join a gym, or just install equipment in my basement. So that's what I did, and if nothing else it got me used to scheduling workout time into my day.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn late January 2018, I bought a power rack, olympic bar & plates, and bench and set them up in my basement ([pic of my setup](https://imgur.com/VpnoUWW) if anyone is interested). I decided on [Phrak's full-body 3-day LP program](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/phraks-gslp), as it was geared toward beginners.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI stuck with Phrak's for about 3 months and saw some pretty good beginner gains. I went from struggling with the empty bar on all movements to 5x70 OHP, 5x110 BP, 5x150 SQ, 5x155 DL (no idea on 1RMs). Still weak, but improving!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAround May of this year, I switched over to a 5-day [nSuns 5/3/1](http://archive.li/2017.01.27-015129/https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5icyza/2_suns531lp_tdee_calculator_and_other_items_all/) program. The volume increase compared to Phrak's was a bit shocking, but I stuck with it. I decided to do nSuns on a cut, which in hindsight may have been a mistake, but I still managed to make some pretty good gains. By November my 1RMs looked like: OHP 110 lbs, BP 160 lbs, SQ 245 lbs (no idea on deadlift; I'm scared to go too heavy). Compared to some of the numbers I see you guys and girls throwing around, I'm still weak - but I feel a whole lot better about myself!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI recently started a bulk and switched to a PPL split to mix things up a bit, but I'll probably return to nSuns at some point to try it while bulking.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOn weekends, I run (both Saturday and Sunday). Usually not more than 10 miles per week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR version:** Started my weightlifting journey with a dumbbell-only program for a couple months, graduated to a full-body 3-day barbell program for 3 months, been doing a 5-day barbell split program since. Went from struggling with the empty bar to (barely!) benching my weight, and squatting ~1.5x my weight in roughly a year. \n\n*****\n\n#Diet\n\nProbably the most important adjustment I made was to start using MyFitnessPal around the time I started lifting. Going from guessing about my daily caloric/protein intake to having detailed information has made a tremendous difference.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOther than logging everything with MFP in order to hit my calorie goals (~1600 while cutting / ~2200 while bulking before adding in exercise), I shoot for at least 150g of daily protein. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI meal prep once per week, and thus tend to eat mostly the same things on weekdays. A typical day might look like:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Breakfast:**\n\n\n* shake (1/2 frozen banana, 8 oz almond milk, 1 serving greek yogurt, spinach, 1 tbsp flax seeds, whey protein)\n* 2 eggs\n* toast or light english muffin\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Snack 1:**\n\n\n* cereal (something low sugar like Cheerios) with almond milk & blueberries\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Lunch:**\n\n\n* 5 oz chicken breast or thigh\n* 100g brown rice **OR** 6 oz sweet potato\n* green vegetable (broccoli, brussell sprouts, etc)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Snack 2:**\n\n\n* peanut butter sandwich (1.5 tblsp peanut butter on light bread)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Dinner:**\n\n\n* typically same as lunch\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Snack 3:**\n\n\n* shake (almond milk, casein protein - maybe peanuts and/or oats if I'm bulking)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOn weekends I typically eat what I want, though I always try to hit 150g+ protein. I still track my calories but I don't beat myself up too much if I'm out with friends and go over by a bunch. I'm a social drinker and probably average 3-4 drinks per week (usually weekends).\n\n*****\n\n#Supplements\n\nWhey protein wherever I need it to hit my protein goal, although usually I find that I can get there with mostly real food.\n\nOne scoop of casein protein before bed on lifting days.\n\n5g creatine daily - just started this a few weeks ago and haven't really noticed any difference.\n\n*****\n\n#Goals/Questions\n\n* My main goal is to put on some more muscle mass while staying relatively lean. From my reading, it seems like most of you recommend alternating cut/bulk cycles to accomplish this. My last cut put me at just over 150 lbs, and my plan is to bulk up to 175 lbs or so and then cut again - with the understanding that the \"ideal me\" (more muscle, less fat) probably weighs around 160-165 lbs. Does that make sense?\n\n* I do want to also improve my running, which has taken a backseat to weightlifting this past year. I know the two goals (lifting / running) aren't that compatible, so if anyone has any advice/tips I'd love to hear it!\n\n* I'd like to improve my numbers a bit more, maybe eventually hit 1.5x bodyweight bench and 2x bw squat. I'm assuming that just continuing to put in the work will allow me to eventually hit those numbers, although my progress is definitely slower than many of you (I'm 42, so that's not unexpected either).

Not shockingly, Amercan Pure Whey is confirmed to be awe inspiringly shitty and also not shockingly, Wal*Mart's Body Fortress sucks too but not as hard.\n\n[Give him your upvotes!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/uva9t/big_reddit_protein_powder_measurement_results/)\n\n**Hail Redditors, I come to you with news from [another forum](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3470330&userid=0&perpage=40&pagenumber=39#post403417301). A guy named Zugzwang (cool as fuck) decided to bust science on American Pure Whey powder, after many suspicious bros wondered why it was A) so cheap and B) tasted so good. The results were interesting and as follows:**\n\n>Brothers, I have just returned from my laboratory dungeon and do not have good news regarding American Pure Whey. I need to formally work up the numbers, but a qualitative eyeballing of the results tells me that either I royally fucked up these two assays (not likely, considering I did 8 independent ones for four separate APW flavors) or there is far less protein in their powder than they claim.\n\n>Here, see for yourselves. I've crudely labeled the wells on this plate for you. One of my assays (detergent-compatible Lowry) basically makes the wells in this plate turn a dark color if there's protein in it, and the darker the well, the more protein there is. I tested blanks (buffer only, no protein), analytical-grade bovine serum albumin at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/mL, ON double rich chocolate (chosen because it's a whey product from a reputable company) at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 3.0 mg/mL, and four separate APW flavors (cinnamon bun, strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla) at 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/mL. Now, those APW concentrations assumed that the values on the label (26 grams protein/33 grams powder) were reliable.\n\n>tl;dr - darker = more protein, APW wells should be roughly as dark as ON wells, they aren't\n\n>* [HARK, A PICTURE OF LITERAL BRO SCIENCE](http://i.imgur.com/XNAa5.png)\n\n>Note: the first three wells in the \"Blanks/APW\" row - under the BSA wells - are blanks, then the next three - under the ON wells - are from another APW sample.\n\n>And yes, I can quantify the amount of protein in the APW samples from absorbance measurements I took from the plate. I think. Shit might be too dilute and out of range of the standard curve I'm making. We'll see.\n\n>The other assay type I ran is a standard method for protein determination: measure how much 280-nm UV light it absorbs. I tested blanks and each protein powder at 1 mg/mL, and though you can't tell just by eyeballing it here (they all look clear), I can tell you that the absorbance of the ON wells was 5-10+ times any of the APW wells, and all were at the same nominal concentration. I'm working within the dynamic range of the instrument, so absorbance correlates linearly to the amount of protein, meaning that 5x the absorbance means 5x as much protein.\n\n>I'm going to repeat the A280 assay tomorrow because it's quick, easy, and it works, but fuuuuuck. The only other explanation besides \"piece of shit product\" is that the bits of APW powder I grabbed were the non-protein bits, which could mean that their powder is horribly mixed - either that, or I'm a goddamned wizard of entropy, because what are the odds of me grabbing 50 milligrams of filler from four separate samples?\n\n>Also hi, if there are any other labcoats reading this and you have 10 minutes to run a quick-n-dirty A280 test on some APW powder to corroborate or contest my results, that would be super, thanks.\n\n**tl;dr: Your cheap powder is shady as fuck and you should feel bad.**\n\n**EDIT: THE PLOT THICKENS**\n\n[American Pure Whey has issued a rebuttal](http://www.americanpurewhey.com/Independent-Lab-COA.html).\n\n>Dear Customers\n\n>Thank you for your continued support to make us a success.\n\n>It has come to our attention that few customers on various message boards are claiming our products do not meet label claims.

I actually slowly weened myself into the diet plan unknowingly. I went from a standard American diet to something more gluten free (again unknowingly) and then all of a sudden I was on a Paleo-like diet, and then I basically eliminated milk and fructose (and root vegetables) from my diet and then I realized I was on a Keto diet. I highly recommend Keto if you are a lifter but at the same time incredibly fat and you require to shed a lot of body fat. You lose a LOT of strength on Keto so your ego will take a huge knock but if you stay true to your goal you will get there.\n\nKeto Macros Everyday \u2013 1843 calories (25c, 150p, 127g)\n\nJust before the holiday season I switched to intermittent fasting and have been on IF ever since. I made the switch because I was going back home and I had minimal control over what I could eat because that was all provided by my mother who cooks (who cooks really good really fat making foods to be honest). I decided to do IF because it would force me to only eat lunch and supper while at the same time never resorting to late night snack binges. So for IF these are my macros\n\nIF Macros Rest day - 1691 calories (223p, 50c, 66f)\n\nIF Macros Workout Day - 2174 (223p, 240c, 35f)\n\n\n**Supplements**\n\n* 5g Creatine Mono\n\n* Caffiene (usually in bulletproof format with coconut oil and grassfed butter)\n\n* 75mg L-Theanine to go with caffeine in my coffee\n\n* 5000mg Combined EPA/DHA (from Omega fish oil caps)\n\n* 5000IU of Vitamin D3 a day\n\nI do have protein powder incase I end up eating a protein deficient meal (when I am poor :D). My suppliments contain a mixture of what you would find in /r/nootropics and any bodybuilding forum. The omegas really do help with inflammation, if I forget to take them I get minor joint pain the next day. L-Theanine reduces the shakes and anxiety that I get from caffiene and it helps me focus.\n\n**Retrospective**\n\nWhat really helped me in my dieting was that I never thought of it as a diet, I always thought of it as a lifestyle change. I always felt like as an endomorph of sorts and to compliment my body type I need to keep my diet in check (don\u2019t really believe in somatotypes but w/e). \nIt\u2019s also almost mandatory to be patient. I pretty much believe that we as humans have a limited will power resource. Rather than trying to start a diet and working out on the same day why not make a habit out of dieting and then 1-2months later start working out? I find that if you get your routine down and it becomes a habit, then adding a new healthy habit to compliment the old one will more likely \u201cstick\u201d with you.\nAlso never say \u201cI will start my diet on Monday\u201d you have already failed.

I just stood there doing my workout and looking back and knowing that feels of being new and not being able to lift a lot. As the kid was struggling to pull off the plates, 2 huge guys approached him and told him to sit back into the machine. The 2 guys then started pep talking the kid and saying don't worry we got you just try your hardest. And with that motivation he pushed and the 2 guys helped and he started doing it!

To those of you this inspired who thanked me the real thanks goes out to you. To anyone who thinks I am lieing when it comes to steroid use, I'm sorry you feel that way. The only people I have anything to prove to is god and myself. I really hope my story works to inspire people to make a change even when all hope is lost. No matter what the circumstances may be. \n\n\nI'll start off by introducing myself. My names /u/not_your_pot_dealer and ten months ago I set out to change my life.\n\nNear my sophomore year of high school i developed a drug abuse problem which lead me to getting kicked off my varsity track and swim team. Not too long after that I gave up kickboxing. By my senior year my drug abuse had escalated severely in the types of substances I was abusing and I barely graduated by a public hair. In those two years I had gone from being a 156lb very athletic young man to around 125lbs.\n\n The next two years of my life completely spiraled out of control and I even found myself hanging on for dear life a few times. I lost all sense of sanity and the person I once was seized to exist. Life was a miserable curse and I was dammed to live through it until the one thing i wouldn't give up decided to kill me.\n\nOn December 4th 2014 id had enough. I checked myself into a detox facility at 121lbs and began turning my life around. I got out of treatment on January 24th 2015.\n\nToday I am 170 lbs (edit going to get a more recent bf assessment done and I'll update within the hour) and couldn't feel any better. The pursuit of physical health helped me save me from myself, and I've decided to devote my life to it.\n\nI work a split routine regimen that runs on bi weekly phases ranging from 1-5 rep ranges through 8-12 rep ranges 5 days a week.\n\nBefore\nhttp://imgur.com/Pz0WTqT\n\nAfter\nhttp://imgur.com/8mGRidw\nhttp://imgur.com/2XV6hAt\nhttp://imgur.com/TmSt6s6\n\nI've set back making this post for a long time but I really just want to do it in hopes it will influence someone to make a change. Cause no matter how hard something seems, it all boils down to a thought and decision. Anything is possible  if you put a little heart and soul into it.\n\nNo excuses.\n\nEdit1: Wow I really appreciate all the kind words, but a few people seem to think I was using PED's and I don't blame you. The asnwer is no. I had a phase where I took some pretty sketchy pre workouts that had some questionable simulants but that didn't even last long cause my addictive personality leaked into how much I would take and I was afraid I'd get mentally dependent on it. The thing is when you go from being basically anorexic for two years to eating an extreme amount you tend to gain alot of weight extremely quickly. In my first two months of being clean I hit 158lbs but was around 15% body fat. I began lifting twice a day for a total of two hours along with cardio in morning and at night. I hit around 167lbs in the next two months still around 12% bf. I started cutting weight and went back down to around 155lbs at 8.5% bf and plateued their for around 2 more months. The last four months have been an extremely careful bulk with the help of a friend who's an excercise physiologist and certified in nutrition. I count my macros at 50 gs of fat 312gs of carbs and 139gs of protein on days I workout and 39gs of fat and 165gs of carbs on rest days.\n \nEdit3: Just to put some math into the equation if I'm 170 lbs at 8.5% bf that means I'm 154lbs of lean body weight. Which is 33 lbs of lean body mass gained an averaged at 3.3 lbs a month. Just to put that in perspective. Whether you think that's natural or not is your decision.\nBesides I have bills to pay, I don't think I could even afford steroids.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Ten month progress.

That topic was deleted by mods. However, I thought I should at least share my findings and experience in case anyone else wanted to go down this route. \n\nFirstly, I'll stick up the before and after picture. \n[Me in speedos](http://i.imgur.com/uegIlmn.jpg)\n\nEdit: I'm 36 and my height is 5ft 9in.\n\n**Body Changes**\n\nStarting weight 92.2kg / 14st 7lbs / 203lbs  \nFinishing weight 81.1kg / 12st 11lbs / 179lbs  \n\n*So a weight loss of 11.1kg / 1st 10lbs / 24.5lbs*\n\nFat % was measured with calipers and calculated based on bicep / tricep / front hip / shoulder blade measurements. (probably not the technical terms but you get the idea).\n\nFat % went from 29% to 19.9% a drop of 9.1%  \nWaist 40.4in to 33.8in  \nArm Diameter 13.4in to 12.8in  \nLeg Diameter 23.4in to 22.4in  \n\n**The Plan**\n\nThe aim was to follow the plan set out by the people running this competition. This broke down into a diet plan to follow, exercise plans to follow, and classes you could attend. \n\nI had already been going to the gym myself, and kinda know what I'm doing. So I ignored their exercise plans and opted to just stick to the Diets they gave, and aimed to go to the gym and workout at least 5 times a week. If I missed the gym I'd go for a 3.8mile run (a route I have near my house that has very little incline)\n\n**Diet Plan**\n\n**Weeks 1 &amp; 2** Around 2170 calories / 168g protein  \n*Breakfast*: \nOats 80g | \nBanana | \nHoney | \nProtein Shake 1 scoop | \n\n*Lunch*: \nBrown Pitta Bread | \nJohn West Tuna Spring water 120g | \nMixed salad green 1 cup | \nMixed nuts 40g | \n\n*Dinner*: \nBroccoli and Cauliflower 80g | \nRump Steak 200g | \nBrown Rice 100g | \n\n*After Workout*: \nProtein shake 1 scoop | \napple | \n\n*Before Bed*: \nCottage cheese 250g | \nCucumber half cup | \nMixed Nuts 40g |   \n\nI opted to disregard the nuts out of this diet. I didn't feel that the high calorie content was worth it. I also didn't have the cotttage cheese. I felt better eating my evening meal, and then fasting until lunch the following day, where I would have my \"Breakfast\". Also 80g of porridge was way too much, so I had 40g.\n\n**Week 3 &amp; 4** Around 1600 Calories / 150g Protein  \n*Breakfast*: \nOats 40g | \nHoney | \nProtein Shake 1 scoop | \n\n*Lunch*: \nJohn West Tuna Spring water 120g | \nMixed salad green 1 cup | \nMixed nuts 40g | \n\n*Dinner*: \nBroccoli and Cauliflower 80g | \nRump Steak 200g | \n\n*After Workout*: \nProtein shake 1 scoop | \napple | \n\n*Before Bed*: \nCottage cheese 250g | \nCucumber half cup | \nMixed Nuts 40g |   \n\nAgain I ignored the nuts and the cottage cheese. \n\n**Week 5** Around 970 Calories  / 135g Protein  \n*Breakfast*: \nOats 40g | \nProtein Shake 1 scoop | \n\n*Lunch*: \nJohn West Tuna Spring water 120g | \nMixed salad green 1 cup | \n\n*Dinner*: \nBroccoli and Cauliflower 80g | \nRump Steak 200g | \n\n*After Workout*: \nProtein shake 1 scoop | \napple | \n\n*Before Bed*: \nCottage cheese 150g | \nCucumber half cup |   \n\nI ignored the cottage cheese and the vegetables. I wouldn't do this long term. I was aiming to knock my carbs out as much as possible this week with a view to my body falling back on fat reserves for fuel. So the only carbs I had were the oats for breakfast.\n\n**Exercise Plan**\n\nThere was no set routine. I just worked as heavy as I could with good form, for a minimum of 4 sets per exercise, and 10-12 reps. One day I would do legs and chest. The next I'd do shoulders and upper back. The next lower back and core. It would be mainly free weights, with some machines. Minimal rest between sets and aim for a 30-40 minute window of exercise to fit in my lunch hour.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI lost far more weight than I thought I could. I thought a stone in weight would be a good aim, but this beat it by far. \n\nI felt energised throughout weeks 1-4 and had no trouble with my workouts. I didn't find the lack of food a problem, as quite honestly there wasn't a lack of food it was just much better quality food than I was used to putting in my body. \n\nI was eating less than the plans dictated as I didn't feel like I needed that much food. \n\nI found week 5 harder, but not hard. I found I'd go to bed earlier and sleep sounder in the last week. I'd also have to take extra rest between sets at the gym to keep the same intensity going. So gym sessions stretched to an hour. If I crouched for a while and then stood up, I'd get dizzy. But that was the only \"bad\" side effect I experienced. \n\nMy mood, sleep patterns, drive, energy, skin condition all improved over the 5 weeks. I have slept better this last 5 weeks than I have anytime in the last 5 years. \n\n**Moving Forward**\n\nI'm increasing my diet by 100 calories each week, and getting back to a normal calorie level. The thinking here is I want to reintroduce high volumes of food slowly so I don't pile the weight back on, and I also still have some remaining fat to lose so this should kill two birds with one stone. \n\nAny questions, ask away :) \n\n[Edit: Formatting]\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "My 5 Week Weight Loss Achievement - Pic and Plan I Followed", "post_ups": 1602, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5y0f0e/my_5_week_weight_loss_achievement_pic_and_plan_i/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:22.277308", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "eood", "post_created_utc": 1421607796.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2suqd8", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 169, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1607, "post_selftext": "/r/eood is a safe place where you can discuss exercise and mental health without judgement, and is specifically made for anyone who may have suffered or suffering from mental health problems.\n\n\nWhether it be anxiety, depression, personality disorders, confidence issues, low self esteem...

It doesn't. \n\n##**I've deliberately left this almost completely unedited so you can see the full length of time it took to prep the meal.

It took me about 30 minutes to cook 7 lunches worth of good food. Once it's in the pot you literally have to pop back to stir it once every 15 minutes or so.... You can iron some clothes, sort your bag for the week, hoover the house, GET SOME SHIT DONE. Normally I'd open the tins whilst the beef was finishing browning but I split it up so it was easier to talk the video through. Ordinarily everything can be in the pot in **under 25 minutes**.\n\n\u00ad**2. But I can't cook!!! I don't know how to do X,Y or Z!!!!**\n\nWatch the video. I chop onions like a complete idiot.

It's too expensive!!!!!****\n\nI could only afford to pre-prep my lunches and it had to be as cheap as what I was eating when I was unfit (ham sandwhich, crisps, chocolate bar). Getting meat is even cheaper in the US. In the UK beef is the cheapest of the still relatively expensive meat.

It was mainly aimed at those serving in the army and government structures such as police but it gained a lot of popularity and in 1979 alone a whopping 11,8 million people passed the normatives. The program ended with the USSR, however as with many things, it has been re-established by Putin in 2014. According to some sources a high grade in this test counts towards the overall score for the University entrance exam, alhtough I'm not sure about this. Currently its a simple and effective way to judge someone's overall fitness.\n\n**Normatives:** There are different normatives for men and women of all ages and three levels that can be obtained for each exercise (bronze, silver and gold).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoys and girls:\n\n6-8yo - [https://imgur.com/a/ZHgSd3H](https://imgur.com/a/ZHgSd3H)\n\n9-10yo - [https://imgur.com/a/QaB9IKQ](https://imgur.com/a/QaB9IKQ)\n\n11-12yo - [https://imgur.com/a/ouEXgqn](https://imgur.com/a/ouEXgqn)\n\n13-15yo - [https://imgur.com/a/yKvES9A](https://imgur.com/a/yKvES9A)\n\n16-17yo - [https://imgur.com/a/pAcaCem](https://imgur.com/a/pAcaCem)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMen:\n\n18-29yo - [https://imgur.com/a/NzFhMaH](https://imgur.com/a/NzFhMaH)\n\n30-39yo - [https://imgur.com/a/6RdTQfu](https://imgur.com/a/6RdTQfu)\n\n40-49yo - [https://imgur.com/a/R9dGWJF](https://imgur.com/a/R9dGWJF) (ignore the incorrect headers, should be 40-45 and 46-49)\n\n50-59yo - [https://imgur.com/a/FGzj4Y9](https://imgur.com/a/FGzj4Y9) (ignore the incorrect headers, should be 50-55 and 56-59)\n\n60-69yo - [https://imgur.com/a/VFWkkd4](https://imgur.com/a/VFWkkd4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWomen:\n\n18-29yo - [https://imgur.com/a/fWzRinP](https://imgur.com/a/fWzRinP)\n\n30-39yo - [https://imgur.com/a/3YsRP9p](https://imgur.com/a/3YsRP9p)\n\n50-59yo - [https://imgur.com/a/7iShj0y](https://imgur.com/a/7iShj0y)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMen and women:\n\n70+yo - [https://imgur.com/a/rvfWm9f](https://imgur.com/a/rvfWm9f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: [https://gto.ru/norms#tab\\_men](https://gto.ru/norms#tab_men)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(I can add more women's normatives later if someone needs it I just don't have time now)\n\nAlso it took me a bit longer than expected, had other work, apologies.

Ya'll got it!\n\n\n5'7\" height, currently 28 years old. I normally lurk on this subreddit but I feel with the didactic portion of my DPT program about to end, it's a fitting time for me just to throw my progression report out there alongside everyone else's. \n\n\nI entered the program at 110 lb. At the time I didn't think anything of my weight because I had always thought that was normal; I was a long distance runner for both the XC and track teams during high school and continued to run throughout my undergraduate years, so I usually had always hovered around 110 lb if not lower. When I went to the beach with a couple of classmates, however, I was appalled - I was skin and bones and was basically the same weight as the smallest girl in the class (who stood at around 5'1\"). Even worse, there were labs for the shoulder early on in the program which required all of us to take our shirts off, and I was so ashamed and embarrassed over the way I looked. My roommates and I were all classmates, so we had already joined LA Fitness together. It wasn't really until January 2015 that we really started taking lifting more seriously than before. Prior to this, we would just go to the gym about 2-3 times a week and try to hit every major muscle group. We didn't follow any specific program, we just kind of did our own thing. Currently it looks something like this:\n\n\nDay 1:\nChest / Shoulders / Triceps\n\n\nDay 2:\nLegs / Triceps / Core\n\nDay 3:\nLats / Traps / Posterior delts. I try to throw in single leg stability work as well to target more of the hip abductors.\n\n\nChest: Bench press, up-ward incline bench press, then flies. For the bench press, if I have my roommate to spot me, then I do one final rep to failure by lowering it as slowly as humanly possible for the eccentric contraction, with him helping me get it back onto the rack.\n\n\nShoulders: Either OHP, or the machine, followed by middle delt pull using a cable and a rope, ending with scaption movements with dumbells. Scaption, meaning it's not completely shoulder abduction, my arm is slightly in front of me as well, say, 15-20 degrees from the frontal plane of my body, so the movement is in the same plane as my scapula.\n\n\nLegs: Alternate between either focusing on squats or deadlifts, but the day includes both at some point. Squats, deadlifts, Romanian deadlifts, front squats, leg press into heel raises after the presses, single leg ball tosses standing on an upside down bosu ball, single leg squats sitting down on a bench, scissor lunges. \n\n\nBack: Pullups, cable lat pulldowns while kneeling, T-bar rows, rhomboid / middle trap machine, T position while prone on an exercise bar with dumbells, posterior fly, sometimes I swap one of the rhomboid/middle traps with inverse rows using the bar of a Smith machine.\n\n\nBiceps: Hammer curls with dumbells, single arm using biceps machine, cable machine\n\n\n\nTriceps: Weighted dips (50 lb for 10 RM at the moment), cable pull-downs, skull-crushers. \n\n\nRinse and repeat those workouts. Sometimes I'd take an off-day and go run instead. I don't think I really have a rest day, usually even when my classmates go out I still manage to get in my workout before, as well as the next day slightly hungover. There was a period of time last year that I spent a lot more time running in addition to working out. I participated and finished in the Philly marathon with a time of about 4:49, which is a pretty shoddy pace, but considering I only managed to get up to 14 miles during training, I'll take it for now.\n\nStarting weight: 110 lb. Current weight: 152 lb.\nhttp://imgur.com/a/fKM5Q\n\nEdit: Okay, so I learned today that I have no idea how to take pictures of my back or legs. Mods, you might have to mark this as NSFW now since I am in my underwear. Sorry, I have zero clue how to do that. \n\nHere are the pictures of triceps, legs, and back. Sorry, quality kind of sucks. This was way harder than it turned out to be without any help available currently. Also that's not my room! :P I don't own as nice of clothes as those. \nhttp://imgur.com/a/Wi9wp\n\n\nBench: 6RM - 170 lb (started at 65 lb)\n\nOHP: 5RM - 95 lb (started at 45 lb). Definitely the hardest one for me. My pebbles still need to be molded into boulders.\n\nPullups: 20 lb weighted, 6 reps followed by a burnout to 9-10 reps after dropping the weight (started at 5 reps bodyweight)\n\nI don't do pendlay rows as of right now because the way I grip the bar irritates the nerves on my left hand; still trying to figure out a way to not piss them off. \n\nSquats: 5RM 225 lb (started at 65 lb)\n\nDeadlifts: 5RM 225 (started at 95 lb). I realize that this is also something I need to work on. My form is a bit off and my hamstrings need to be stretched out way more, since I basically start the movement with my back close to parallel to the ground, making my lower back the weak link. I am not willing to go heavier until I stretch out my hammies and fix my form to avoid rounding my back. \n\nMy diet consisted of Chipotle, Wawa, protein shakes, nuts, and chicken and rice whenever I got off my lazy ass to cook stuff. I never really counted calories. I just figured I'd try to eat as much as I can. As of right now I've been stagnant at my current weight for several months now. I kind of want to slowly increase it to 160~, but with summer incoming I guess I'll just do it starting in the fall. I also would like to abs to show a bit more, there's a little layer of fat around my stomach. However, I'm fine with it at the moment, it's a necessary evil when I bulked so much and ate so dirty.\n\nEdit:\nI just wanted to mention that body dysmorphia is a real thing. When I look at myself just using the mirror, it's hard to tell that I even made progress. In my mind, I still look weak and small. It's only when I compare myself to what I used to look like I can really appreciate the work that I have put in.\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "1.5~ years of lifting (August 2014 to present)", "post_ups": 1587, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4jhcf5/15_years_of_lifting_august_2014_to_present/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:22.277308", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "spankolol", "post_created_utc": 1468216029.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1471206665.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "4s9fxo", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 211, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1582, "post_selftext": "/!\\ UPDATE WITH DEXA SCAN RESULTS /!\\\n\nA lot of people commented that my Hydrostatic body fat test results were wrong and debated the accuracy of Hydrostatic, DEXA, etc. So I finally had a DEXA done yesterday. Below are the results along with a link to both the Hydrostatic and DEXA reports. \n\nI think this will be interesting since it comes up a lot on r/fitness and r/progresspics. I'd also just like to state that it wasn't my intention to prove anything. I'm the sort of person who couldn't sleep after exams in College because of the anxiety from not knowing how I did. When I did the Hydrostatic test I felt it was too good to be true and always sort of doubted it. Then when everyone on here started debating it made me even more anxious to know for sure.\n\n\nHYDROSTATIC - Done on 5/24/16\n\n* Weight: 166.5 lbs\n* BF%: 13%\n* Fat Body Mass: 21.64 lbs\n* Lean Body Mass: 144.86 lbs\n\nDEXA - Done on 8/13/2016\n\n* Weight: 162.1 lbs\n* BF%: 15.1%\n* Fat Body Mass: 24.5 lbs\n* Lean Body Tissue: 131.4 lbs\n\nReports: http://imgur.com/a/4KrZe\n\nSome interesting info:\n\n* The Hydrostatic guy said his test counts skin as lean body mass.\n* The DEXA lady said skin is counted as fat body mass.\n* I recently had a couple consultations with plastic surgeons and they both said I have 5-6 lbs of loose skin.\n\nOriginal post below.\n_______________________________\n\nTLDR:\n\nr/fitness was my gateway drug to the world of fitness and nutrition. In two years I went from 290lbs to 165. 45% bf to <13%. 48\" waist to 32. 2XL shirts to small. I do 25 miles of intense cardio a week in addition to lifting MWF at the gym.\n\nPics\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/RCwp4\n\nI'm really bad at taking pictures of myself and I don't have any good ones from before I lost weight. I wish and could go back in time and take some before pictures. Never thought I'd do what I've done. No front shirtless pics because I have a bit of lose skin. I need surgery but I don't want to pay for it and keep waffling on whether I want to do it or not. I have an amazing looking chest with saggy old man boobs below it.\n________________________________________________\n\nMy stats\n\n32/M/5'4\"\n\nJuly 2014: 290lbs / 45%ish body fat\n\nJuly 2016: 165lbs / <13% body fat\n________________________________________________\n\nA little bit about me\n\nI've been morbidly obese since Elementary School. The first time I weighed over 200 was in middle school and in High School I hit 250. I've never been into sports at all except pro wrestling (WWF) as a kid. I'm a huge nerd. The proudest moment of my life was making the front page of MMO-Champion with my WoW guild when we got a U.S. first Algalon kill in Wrath of the Lich King. I've always been a hardcore gamer and comic book nerd and that will never changed.\n________________________________________________\n\nIn July of 2014 at the age of 30 I decided it was time to lose weight. I went through a lot of shit in a relatively short amount of time and was super depressed. One Saturday I realized I felt so lazy and tired I couldn't even be bothered to get out of bed and play WoW. I just laid there all day feeling depressed and shitty. There were a lot of factors that motivated me to start exercising, but I don't want go over it all on reddit (yes I wanted to impress a woman). \n\n\nSo I signed up at 24hr Fitness and started exercising MWF after work. At the time I just wanted to lose 30-40 lbs.  When I started I didn't change my caloric intake at all. I just started exercising 3 days a week. The exercise was so hard at first I wanted to quit after 2 nights at the gym. I couldn't do anything without getting gassed. Tiny asian girls were lifting heavier than me and I would sweat gallons walking on the treadmill for a couple minutes. It was really embarrassing and I still can't believe I didn't give up.\n\nMy beginning routine was something like this:\n\n* 10-15 minutes Elliptical (this would nearly kill me, low resistance, could barely handle it)\n\n* 30-45 minutes weight lifting (more like flailing around with really low weight, bicep curls, bench press, overhead presses, leg press all with extremely awful form)\n\n* 5-10 minutes Treadmill or Elliptical (less than 5 miles per hour, low to zero resistance/incline)\n\n\nI discovered this subreddit shortly after. I think a friend linked me a post of a guy that lost a ton of weight and looked really similar to me. He could have passed for my twin brother. It wasn't that big a deal at the time but seeing this guy's story and his success was one of the little things that motivated me. Through r/fitness I found stronglifts, IIFYM, ICF, bodybuilding.com, and other similar sites. I would regularly check this subreddit and r/progresspics to see other peoples success stories. It helped me a lot to see normal people successfully lose weight and get jacked that aren't shilling supplements or diet programs.\n\n\n\n\nOver time the exercise became easier and easier. After a few weeks I started eating less. After a few months I started counting calories, tracking macros, and meal planning. Then I started meal prepping my lunch and dinner on Sunday nights for Monday-Friday. That made a massive difference. I iterated a lot on my meal plan over the last two years. I used IIFYM and the diet FAQ to guide my meal plan. This is what it looks like right now, http://i.imgur.com/hscRVtB.png\n\n\nKeep in mind its not a log. Its my basic plan. I usually eat 100-300 calories more than the total at the bottom. On the weekend I eat totally different stuff but keep my calories around 1800ish. Yes every once in a while I have a fat day. They are not planned, I don't do cheat days on purpose, but I also don't stress or worry about it when it happens. Always remember that your diet and weight loss/gain is slow thing that occurs over time. Think of calories like money. You budget them and spend them. You go over your balance you make it up later over time. Somebody brings you a cookie at work? Take 200 calories off your breakfast the next day (depending on the cookie, be honest with yourself) and deal with it. If I eat over my budget, I'll make it up over several days or even weeks. For example a tbsp of pb is 95 calories. If I need to make up 600 calories I'll eat 1 tbsp instead of 2 for 5-6 days. Or cut the lunch almonds for a day or two.\n\n\n\nAs far as workouts go, for most of the last two years I would basically do Stronglifts with cardio before (elliptical 10-15 minutes @ level 10-15, 1.5-2.25 miles) and after (treadmill (25-30 minutes @ 6-8mph, 3-3.5 miles). I never actually followed the SL program strictly, I just used that set of lifts and did 5x5. I would almost always add 1-2 other lifts/exercises as well. \n\n\nLast July I went to run outside for the first time and did like 4.5 miles which was huge for me. In High School I couldn't jog 2 minutes on the track. I remember the coach would make us do 2 laps (1/2 mile) before PE as a warmup. I'd get gassed in a minute jogging and walk the rest. I had straight As in High School but got Cs and even a D in PE because me and a friend would frequently skip class and go to the donut shop lol.\n\n\nI do 25 miles of cardio a week now and really enjoy it. When I did 4.5 miles that first time it made me feel really good. So I made it an every Sunday morning thing. After a few weeks it became 5 miles every sunday, then a month later 6, then 7, etc. I'm up to 11 miles every Sunday and I always maintain over a 6mph average. This is the graph on my Sunday runs from my phone app, http://i.imgur.com/jii11Vy.png. \n\n\nThere are gaps because I hurt my back deadlifting twice and had to stop exercising for 2-4 weeks each time. I was exercising for a year before I ever started working on or caring about form. I was doing shit completely wrong for the first 60-70 lbs I lost. I honestly think it just proves the point that calories in is what matters most and any kind of exercise is good as long as you don't hurt yourself. My first proper squat was probably like 6-7 months ago. That being said if I could do it all over I would have focused way more on form from the start and used a structured lifting program.\n\n\nIn May the manager of my gym approached me about entering a bodyfat contest. The person who lost the most relative bodyfat as a % over 6 weeks would win $1,000. I entered and destroyed it. I supercut down to 1200-1400 calories a day the whole time, without lowering the exercise I was doing. I won with 23% reduction in body fat. 2nd and 3rd place were both 9.5% each so I beat them both combined. At my weigh in I was at 158 lbs. I had lost 14 lbs in 6 weeks. I lost a ton of strength on all the major lifts. 10-20 lbs off every working set. \n\n\nI was so hungry and felt so shitty that I gorged for 4 days and gained 10 lbs afterwards. I ate like a man who was told he had 4 days to live. It was fucking amazing. I would eat a bowl of mini-oreos like cereal for breakfast (they get soggy really fast, it wasn't very good). Entire pizza for dinner. One day I went to a buffet then a bakery for dessert. I ate so much I was in physical pain. \n\n\nMy gym used one of those handheld things to test body fat and I know they are innaccurate so I made an appointment to do hydrostatic testing. I waited a few weeks after my 4 days of gluttony so I could undo some of the damage. The Hydrostatic test put me at 13% bf and 166 lbs. I still can't believe it! That was on May 24th. I plan on doing the test again. I want to get down to 160 lbs and 10% bodyfat. Its been really hard to keep losing though so I'm holding off. I cant seem to get lower than 165. I'll go down to 163 then up to 170. I've found it really difficult to keep cutting.\n\n\nI never really tracked my lifts and I really wish I had. Right now I'm doing a totally different lifting workout but my 5x5s are:\n\n* low bar squat 165 lbs (this is still my worst lift, my form is not great but its not awful either)\n\n* DL 1x5 225 lbs\n\n* Bench Press 175 lbs (before the bf contest I was doing 185 lbs 5x5 for about 3 weeks, I haven't been able to do this since)\n\n* SOHP 110 lbs\n\n* pendlay rows 125 lbs\n\nMy lifts aren't even very good. My bench seems good but its the only lift I've been doing since the beginning (july 2014). I would guess that if I started bulking I'd get a lot stronger quickly. I'm kind of afraid to bulk though. I need skin reduction surgery first.\n\n\nThis post ended up being way to long. If anyone has questions I'll answer them. If you take anything away from my story it should be that anyone can lose weight and change their life. If I can do it anyone can. The difference in how I feel is indescribable. Losing weight is hard but not complicated. Count your calories and be consistent. Also please don't waste your time or money on gimmicks or supplements. You don't need any of that shit to lose weight.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Lost 125~lbs over the last 2 years. 45+% bf to under 13%.

I am especially excited about this because my first child (a daughter!) is due tomorrow and she could come at any time, and I'm sure that it will interfere with my training for a while.\n\n\n\nI am 6'3\" 29M, 210 lbs. My last tested squat 1RM is 375 lbs but it is probably closer to 405 now. My bench is lagging with a ~245 lbs 1RM.\n\n\n\nIt took me 9 months of training to go from hitting 405x5 for the first time to hitting 500 lbs. After I hit 405 I went on a cut and lost some strength, but then in about August I started cultivating mass again and really set my sights on 500. I told myself that I would bulk for as long as it took to hit my goal, and as added motivation I made a friendly bet with my friends that I could hit before they hit their arbitrary fitness goals (a 3:43 marathon and a 5 minute mile, respectively). I am happy to say that I won!\n\n\n\nDuring my cut after hitting 405 I was running PHAT, and then at some point around when I switched to a bulk I began running PHUL. I didn't really like PHUL as much except that I liked 4 workouts a week much more than 5. So about 6 weeks ago I [developed my own program](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12qQ2OLEly_XAL2RJmkuUzpvn-QkYfLOQ1dwGrO-ahEU/edit#gid=609222124) which is essentially a 4 day body part split focusing on one compound lift per day. For deadlifts I would pull heavy triples for three weeks in a row and then attempt a 1RM. I hit 435, 465, 485 easily doing that, but I had more trouble getting over the hump to 500. That is likely due to me trying to rush it with the birth of my daughter being imminent - I attempted and failed 500 two weeks in a row before getting it yesterday.\n\n\n\nOh, and it felt so easy I hit a [505 deadlift right afterwards!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgqeCSq8wjk)\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about deadlift progression.

In around early march, I finally learnt about calorie counting, setting a reasonable deficit, training efficiently, and getting a gram of protein per pound of body weight.\n\n I dialled in my diet, eating around 1800-1900 calories a day, and training and I loved the results. I was so focused on the end goal, that I never had a cheat meal because I never felt the urge to. I thought i would be done my cut around may, with the end goal being 160 pounds (10 pounds lighter than last summer) but I found out that I needed to lose more.

There really isn't an easy answer, but I decided to create a guide to the best of my ability to help anyone who needs it.\n\nMy experience is lots of training over a lot of years, gains, losses, injuries and god damn do I wish I was training like I am now while I was younger rather than making mistakes and over training.\n\nMost people just want to know what exercises, how many reps and sets and how many times a week. I'll throw a workout down the bottom for anyone who wants that, but if you REALLY want to improve - read the whole thing and LEARN how to jump higher.\n\nIf you don't know what the exercises mentioned are, just google them or search on youtube. If needed I will add links to exercises at a later time.\n\nI'll break this in to a few categories - Your Weakness, Technique, Strength Training, Plyometric Training, Injuries and Over-training & Recovery.\n\n**YOUR WEAKNESS**\n\nIt is important to figure out any weaknesses you might have that will hold you back from achieving your goal. Some examples are:\n\n* Weak/underactive calves\n* Weak/underactive quads\n* Weak/underactive glutes\n* Weak/underactive core\n* Poor technique\n* Excess weight\n* Etc.\n\nIf you have identified a weakness, its important to fix this first. Work on that muscle group or issue for 2-4 weeks to help it catch up to the rest of your body.\n\nFor me, it was weak calves. I just couldn't feel them firing and helping my jump like I could my other leg muscles. To fix this, I changed my running technique to a forefoot/midfoot strike, and did calf raises every day until they were strong enough to match my thunder thighs.\n\n**TECHNIQUE**\n\nJumping technique is extremely important and a fix to a small part of your technique could mean an inch or more gain. First figure out your preferred method of jumping - are you a one foot jumper or two foot jumper? This will also be important for training later on.\n\nTypically a **one foot jumper** is someone who is taller, long limbs, bouncier and less muscular. They achieve a high jump by being explosive, having good spring in their muscles, momentum and technique.\n\nTypically a **two foot jumper** is someone who is shorter and/or more muscular. They achieve a high jump by explosiveness, muscular strength and power and technique.\n\n*Note: You can be both. Good jumpers often can jump equally well off one or two feet and I would encourage you to work on both variations - especially if you are playing basketball.*\n\nI can't give you a much better guide on technique than [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I2N7zp0F_w) youtube video so check it out (disclaimer: not my video)\n\n**STRENGTH TRAINING**\n\nMore strength = ability to generate more force = higher jump. Hopefully you have access to some weights, doing your usual lifts like back squats & deadlifts are a great start and potentially enough when combined with plyometrics to get you to your goal. For those who know how or enjoy doing it, power cleans, clean and jerks, snatches can be great for building that explosive strength. Where possible, always use free weights (barbell, trap bar, kettle bells, dumbbells) over machines. It will help build your core strength and balance at the same time as your strength.\n\nMY ROUTINE:\n\n*Train within your ability. Goal weights are to be built towards. start with what you can achieve and add on more weight as you improve to get to your goal weight*\n\n* Warmup\n\n* Deadlifts 3 sets of 5-8 reps. The goal weight should be 1.5-2 times your body weight. (Tip: A trap bar works great for deadlifts as the higher handles put your body within the range of motion you use for a jump)\n\n* Back squats 3 sets of 5-8 reps. The goal weight should be 1.5 times your body weight. Build up to it.\n\n* Standing Calf Raises 3 sets of 5-8 reps. The goal weight should be 1 times your body weight. Use kettle bells, trap bar or barbell for this rather than a calf raise machine, its ok for your knees to bend slightly but don't rely on the muscles above your knee to push out your reps - concentrate on activating and working those calves.\n\n* Farmers Carry 3 sets of 10-20 steps. The goal weight should be 0.5-1 times your body weight. Try to activate your calves to create plantar flexion throughout the steps.\n\n* Kettlebell Swings 3 sets of 5-8 reps. The goal weight should be 20-30kg or 45-60lbs. This is a great exercise for activating your glutes. Swing the kettlebell through your legs and lift to shoulder height.\n\nADVANCED\n\n* Power cleans OR Clean and Jerks 3 sets of 3-5 reps. Goal weight should be 1 times your body weight. This is an explosive exercise and the goal should be explosive strength and maximal effort/muscle activation.\n\n**PLYOMETRIC TRAINING**\n\nThis is the training that will improve your \"springy-ness\". I'll break this down in to two categories - **Power** and something I call **Rebound-Power**.\n\n**Power** is the ability to use the strength you have QUICKLY to generate a high leap.\n\n*Example: a standing vertical leap test. You stand in a stationary position, squat down, swing your arms through and drive through with the legs to jump high.*\n\nThe \"springy-ness\" you will want to feel for a good vertical leap comes from **Rebound-Power**. It's your ability to absorb impact and turn that in to potential energy through the elastic nature of your muscles/tendons before quickly applying your power through your fast twitch muscle fibres to create that explosive force needed to jump high. \n\n*Example: a running vertical leap test. With a run up, you must absorb the kinetic energy created from the approach, your muscles and tendons stretch as they absorb this energy, then contract as you initiate the leap to create even more power than was possible on your standing vertical leap. Note: a running vertical leap should always be higher than your standing vertical leap, if it is not you need to work on your technique and plyometrics.*\n\nTo get the MAXIMUM results from your plyometric training, you must do the exercises at MAXIMAL EFFORT. There are so many good plyometric exercises, I\u2019ve tried a lot of them and I believe the ones below give the best results - you might disagree and really enjoy a certain exercise. Feel free to add it in or replace one of my recommended exercises. Its important to not over-do it. A plyo workout should be at maximal effort, as such its probably not going to last much longer than 30 minutes. So pick 3-5 exercises and do them well. Try to include stationary jumps, running jumps as well as exercises that will work different muscle groups and one foot and two foot take offs.\n\n*Note: Landing gently is very important. Land with the intention of absorbing impact and not jarring your body.*\n\n*Note 2: There are so many great plyometric exercises that I haven't included in this particular routine. Examples are Depth Jumps, Seated Box Jumps, Bounding, Broad Jumps, or even Sprints and Skipping Rope. Feel free to replace my exercises with the exercises you like. Or even change the workout every couple of weeks by substituting a different plyometric exercise in. Just keep the workout around 30 minutes with 3-5 exercises that you train at maximal effort.*\n\nMy routine:\n\n* Warm up first with walking lunges, frankenstein walk, leg swings, power skipping (the 5 year old running/prancing kind of skipping), body weight squats & calf raises.\n\n* Split Jumps 2-3 sets of 10 jumps (5 each side) alternating legs as you jump. These can also be called lunge jumps. Jump as high as possible with every jump, and absorb the impact carefully ensuring the knee of your rear leg does not hit the ground.\n\n* Backboard Touches OR Rebound Jumps 2-3 sets of 5-10 jumps. How you do this is up to you and your preferred jump. Can be stationary if you want to work on power, or with a run up off one or two feet for Rebound-Power. Your goal is to touch as high up as possible, if you can\u2019t touch the backboard, just keep trying and jump and reach as high as possible. If stationary, you can do Rebound Jumps which is 2 Backboard Touches in a row. Jump and touch the backboard, land on the balls of your feet and try to not let your heels touch the ground, bend and explode back up for the 2nd touch. You can also do Rebound Jumps off one foot to strengthen your one foot jumps. Also also, you can do Rebound Jumps while holding a basketball and tapping it against the backboard.\n\n* Box Jumps/Stair Jumps 2-3 sets of 5-10 jumps. Find a box, a wall, a set of stairs, something you can jump on top of and jump up it from a stationary position. Something around waist height is usually about right and you can go higher when you get better. I like using stairs as you can count how many stairs you have cleared and try to get further.\n\n* Super Mario Jumps 2-3 sets of 5-10 jumps each leg. This is a great exercise for making you look like a crazy person at the gym or out in the park. Hard to explain so watch [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWlm8K1PqE) video to understand it better. The trick here is to use your hip flexors to drive that knee up towards your chest and your opposite arm punching upwards like Mario. Use your rebound-power and quickness to make sure your foot spends as little time as possible on the ground.\n\n* Max Effort Jumps 1 set of 5 jumps. This is the grand finale of your workout. With a run up, try to jump as high as possible off one or two feet (whatever your preference) - try to touch the backboard, the ring or anything up high. Be sure to rest up a bit after the above exercises and in between your max effort jumps so you can jump with maximal effort. 1-2 minutes between jumps helps replenish your ATP stores which are important for explosiveness. You might not get your personal best here as you just did a workout, but its good to tie it all together and do the exercise you\u2019re training for.\n\n\nADVANCED\n\n* Do the above routine while wearing a weighted vest at 10% of your body weight, if doing 3 sets of an exercise, remove the weighted vest for the last set feelsgoodman.jpg\n\nKeep in mind you will be heavier and landing softly and absorbing impact is VERY important.\n\n**INJURIES & OVER-TRAINING**\n\nDon\u2019t do too much. Training every day is not sustainable, you will end up with an overuse injury like jumpers knee or a worse injury like ligament/meniscal damage in your knee. These will require treatment and prolonged REST - I have been here, I went way too hard and was getting great gains on my leap before getting jumpers knee and all my gains were lost while dealing with it and recovering.\n\nLong training sessions and more and more exercises don\u2019t mean more gains. Vertical leap is an explosive, high intensity movement. Your workouts should be the same at roughly 30 minutes long. Train for too long and you\u2019ll be working slow twitch muscles instead of fast twitch or increase the risk of poor technique, fatigue and injury.\n\n3 training sessions a week is enough. Decide what your training needs and do a 2:1 ratio of Strength:Plyometrics or Plyometrics:Strength (e.g. 2 x strength training sessions, 1 x plyometric training session per week). A good way to decide on this is with a comparison of your standing vertical leap and running vertical leap. If your standing vertical leap sucks in comparison to your running vertical leap - do more strength training. If your running vertical leap sucks or is too similar to your standing vertical leap - do more ploy training. Keep in mind your running vertical leap SHOULD be higher than your standing vertical leap.\n\nOn your Off-Training days you can work on core strength, upper body strength and/or playing basketball.\n\n**RECOVERY**\n\nIf you want your body to do its best, you\u2019ve got to treat it nicely too. My favourite recovery techniques are foam rolling my legs and back after training sessions followed by a swim in a cool pool (I live in a hot climate). Other recovery techniques are hot/cold showers, general stretching, massage therapy or physical therapy such as physio/chiro/etc. I can\u2019t tell you what your body needs exactly, but do something that counts towards recovery.\n\nThat\u2019s it! Hope you enjoyed the wall of text. Feel free to critique or add in your say. If I\u2019ve gotten some terminology wrong let me know and I\u2019ll fix it up.\n\n\n**THE ENTIRE EASY TO READ WORKOUT**\n\n**STRENGTH TRAINING**\n\n*Train within your ability. Goal weights are to be built towards. start with what you can achieve and add on more weight as you improve to get to your goal weight*\n\n* Warmup\n\n* Deadlifts 3 sets of 5-8 reps. The goal weight should be 1.5-2 times your body weight.\n\n* Back squats 3 sets of 5-8 reps. The goal weight should be 1.5 times your body weight.\n\n* Standing Calf Raises 3 sets of 5-8 reps. The goal weight should be 1 times your body weight.\n\n* Farmers Carry 3 sets of 10-20 steps. The goal weight should be 0.5-1 times your body weight.\n\n* Kettlebell Swings 3 sets of 5-8 reps. The goal weight should be 20-30kg or 45-60lbs.\n\nADVANCED\n\n* Power cleans OR Clean and Jerks 3 sets of 3-5 reps. The goal weight should be 1 times your body weight.\n\n**PLYOMETRIC TRAINING**\n\n* Warm up first with walking lunges, frankenstein walk, leg swings, skipping (the 5 year old running/prancing kind of skipping), body weight squats & calf raises.\n\n* Split Jumps 2-3 sets of 10 jumps (5 each side) alternating legs as you jump.\n\n* Backboard Touches OR Rebound Jumps 2-3 sets of 5-10 jumps.\n\n* Box Jumps/Stair Jumps 2-3 sets of 5-10 jumps.\n\n* Super Mario Jumps 2-3 sets of 5-10 jumps each leg.\n\n* Max Effort Jumps 1 set of 5 jumps.\n\n\nADVANCED\n\n* Do the above routine while wearing a weighted vest at 10% of your body weight.\n\n**STRENGTH AND PLYOMETRIC TRAINING ARE TO BE COMPLETED ON SEPARATE DAYS**\n\n**DO 2 x STRENGTH TRAINING and 1 x PLYOMETRIC TRAINING PER WEEK (TOTAL 3 SESSIONS)** \n\nOR \n\n**DO 1 x STRENGTH TRAINING and 2 X PLYOMETRIC TRAINING PER WEEK (TOTAL 3 SESSIONS)**\n\n**WORK ON CORE AND UPPER BODY STRENGTH OR SHOOT SOME HOOPS ON THE OTHER DAYS**\n\nTL;DR: Do strength exercises, do plyometric exercises, practice jumping as high as possible.\n\n**EDIT: A lot of comments below suggested that 8-10 reps of the strength training exercises were excessive and that lower reps would be more beneficial for explosive strength. I have edited and dropped the reps to 5-8 reps. Please use the above as a guide and feel free to customize it to your needs - if you want to do 3-5 reps or even 1 rep max then go for it, make it your own and do what you enjoy! Thanks for the input so far everyone :)**\n\n**EDIT2: Some more good feedback and advice in the comments below! For anyone reading this far, check out what people have said below as it may apply to you or just simply sound good. I have added a note to the plyometric training section stating that you can substitute other plyo exercises for the ones I have mentioned if you prefer them. I encourage people to make their vertical jump training routine their own and tailor it to their needs.**", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Vertical Leap Training: The great wall of text that will hopefully get you jumping higher and higher!", "post_ups": 1568, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4wqqb6/vertical_leap_training_the_great_wall_of_text/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:22.277308", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "incognitoplant", "post_created_utc": 1456162540.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "471xd1", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 305, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1567, "post_selftext": "I've been staring at it for 30 minutes, three times a day, trying to engage it in conversation, and that doesn't seem to provide the results I'm looking for, so I think it's time to try another program. \n\nI'm 37, female, 138 lb, currently cutting.

When I started, I was 20 YO, 5'10, 125 lbs, and looked a lot like most leukemia patients. In my first two years I worked out with a buddy who told me to eat anything and everything in order to gain weight. As a result, I ate a lot of crap and bulked up to about 170, followed by a cut down to about 148, which can be seen here:\n\n\n[148 lbs](http://imgur.com/a/iNuGV)\n\n\nAt this point I was pretty happy with my progress and decided that I was going to try my hand at a clean bulk my second time around, which is where this post starts. At the title implies, I lived almost entirely off of egregious amounts of chicken, broccoli, and rice. The diet that I followed about 6 days a week was:\n\n\nBreakfast:\nSmoothie consisting of 5 strawberries, 1/2 cup of greek yogurt, 1/2 cup of oats, 2 cups of skim milk, 1/2 scoop of mass gainer: 885 calories.\nBlueberry Bagel with peanut butter: 315 calories\n\n\nLunch:\n3 cups of steamed white rice: 618 calories\n1/2 lb of cooked chicken breast: 220 calories\n1/2 crown of broccoli: 50ish? calories\nFuck ton of hot sauce: 0 calories. (I estimate that I've gone through about 2.5 gallons of hot sauce in this time frame.)\n\n\nDinner: Exact same thing as lunch: 838 calories.\n\n\nSnack: Protein shake: 280 calories\n\n\nExtras: Realizing my diet is not very diverse, I took a multivitamin daily. Also took 5g of creatine on *most* days.\n\n\nDaily total: 3,202 calories. 205g protein, 408g carbs, 33g fat.\n\n\nI would go out to eat once or twice a week, but made sure to log it and still hit my calorie goal. 3000-3200 calories/day was my goal based off of what MyFitnessPal told me was right to gain 1 lb/week.\n\n\nI followed PHUL for about 3 months until I started to plateau and just generally got sick of doing legs half the time I was in the gym. From there I switched to PHAT, liked that plan a lot better, and followed it for the remaining 5 months. I have a book that I log all of my workouts in and my goal every week was to do more weight or at least 1 more rep every time I was in the gym. I saw decent strength gains, but nothing to write home about. I never really max out, but at the beginning of the bulk I was about:\n\n\nBench:135 for 3x5\n\nDeadlift: 225 for 3x5\n\nDB OHP: 45's for 4x5\n\n\n\nEnd of Bulk:\n\n\nBench: 205 1RM\n\nDL: 315 1RM\n\nDB OHP: 55's for 3x8\n\n\nAt the same time, I also got really fat:\n\n\n[End of Bulk](http://imgur.com/a/fCdRH)\n\n\nI'm about 182 in this picture, and thought I had done a decent job of bulking, until I started cutting and realized I hadn't really gotten anywhere.\n\n\nFor the cut I followed a bro split of chest/tris, - back/bis - shoulders - legs - and 1 day of cardio. My goal every week was to go in and do the exact same weight and amount of reps I did the week before, while continue to lose weight. In the kitchen, my goal was to stay within 1800-2000 calories and hit at least 170 grams of protein per day. As long as I hit those 2 goals, I ate kind of whatever I wanted. The cut lasted about 4 months and I went from 182 to about 158, as seen here:\n\n\n[End of Cut](http://imgur.com/a/SgIX3)\n\n\nTechinally, I've gained 10 lbs in the last year, but that obviously isn't 10 lbs of muscle. My strength is just slightly above what it was a year ago, but my waist is also about 2 inches wider and I'm not nearly as vascular. Summer is ending soon and I'm gonna start bulking here in the coming weeks, and so I'm wondering what I can do to improve this time around.\n\n\nIt seems like every other bulking post on here is just \"I ate a fuck ton of food and got super strong, without counting macros!\" and they make 10x the progress (or lack thereof) that I've made in the last year.

If you are actually hungry and not just craving something, you will be satisfied eating anything. So if you're ever wanting food and thinking \"man, I'm hungry, my body needs energy so I should at least eat something,\" stop and ask yourself: could I go for some broccoli now, or do I just want pizza?

Yesterday I did a bench only competition and [managed to break a record](https://instagram.com/p/9xiqX2CT3k/) that's stood for three years.\n\nAge: 21\n\nHeight: 5\"5\n\nWeight 82.3 kg\n\n**General Background and Training**\n\nI started powerlifting in late June this year, and since then I've done two meets ([First Meet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNPldC6KdcU), [Second Meet](https://instagram.com/p/6gi5NqhUTJ/)).  I currently train six days a week squatting/deadlifting thrice a week and benching four times a week with accessories thrown in throughout.  If you want a more thorough explanation let me know in the comments.\n\n----\n\n**Meet Prep**\n\nThis meet was treated as a deload for my squats and deads, and an opportunity for me to redeem myself after missing 163 kg at Junior Nationals three months ago.  I peaked my bench for the six weeks leading up to this with the intention of hitting 170/172.5 on the third.  I cut water for the first time ever for this meet as I weighed 85 kg a week prior.  I don't feel it affected my performance at all, besides feeling a little burpy after rehydrating.\n\n\n----\n\n**The Meet**\n\nIt was disgustingly hot, I was losing about 1 kg of fluid per hour so I was drinking copious amounts of water and sports drink to counteract that.  It was nice doing a bench only as it meant I had more time to rehydrate and got to spectate and cheer throughout all the squats and deads.\n\n**The Lifts**\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/O51yCcPEPO0\n\nBefore I even had my first attempt I noticed that the referee giving the press call was a lot more strict than my previous meets and definitely more strict that what I do in training.\n\nBench: 155/163/170.5x\n\n* Attempt #1(make): 155 kg/341.7 lbs, This attempt felt a little bit off, not because it was difficult but because the warm up area didn't have any comp-spec racks.  I'm spoiled by my gym and really only bench on an Eleiko/ER rack so it felt extremely weird in my warm ups.  Looking back at the video it definitely moved faster than it felt.  I only got two whites as my butt came off the bench, I was lucky that only one of the refs caught that.\n\n\n* Attempt #2(make): 163 kg/359.3 lbs, The weight I missed at Nationals, I wasn't at all worried about completing the lift but moreso the issue of my butt coming up.  After completing this lift I honestly thought I would see two reds from the sides as I felt my hips rise, but again I was lucky enough to be granted a gift.  It moved extremely fast so I stuck with the plan for my third. This was a 0.5 kg comp PB at a lighter bodyweight (Previous best was 162.5 @ 87).\n\n* Attempt #3(No lift): 170.5 kg/375.9 lbs, This was over ambitious attempt selection, but I went for it anyway, it was simply too heavy for me.  Missing this let me know that I'm definitely over projecting based off my training numbers.\n\n----\n\n**Results**\n\nThe goal for this meet was simply to re-do my bench attempts from nationals, whilst I'm upset that I didn't hit my third bench I'm happy that I successfully got the record that I wasn't able to get in August.  The record had stood since 2012, before I had even started lifting.  I don't think I'm far off 170 so hopefully I'll be able to hit upwards of that in my next meet.\n\n**Conclusion and plans for the immediate future**\n\nIt was a really fun meet and I got to catch up with a bunch of people that I hadn't seen since I first competed.  In regards to the adjustments I'll make to my future training, I feel that the press calls in this meet were definitely longer than what I implement in training, as a result of this I'll probably start implementing longer pauses in future.  I now have five weeks to prepare for my finally meet of the year which will be a 3-lift where I intend on improving poverty squat and deadlift and hopefully manage a decent total.\n \n\n ----\n\n\nFeel free to offer advice on form or whatever or to ask questions :)\n\n**TLDR:**  \nThird powerlifting meet, first bench only, went 2/3 breaking the previous Powerlifting Australia 83 kg Jr. record by .5 kg.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/O51yCcPEPO0\n\nLink to the /r/powerlifting thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/3ryxkl/meet_report_bnb_barbell_bash_brisbane_australia/?ref=share&ref_source=link\n\n*Note: The reasoning behind the 0.5 was to improve my [touch n' go PB of 170 kg](https://instagram.com/p/60yoabCT8K/) which I hit earlier this year.*", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Yesterday I bench pressed 163 kg/359.3 lbs @ 82.1 kg/181.4 lbs breaking the Powerlifting Australia u83 kg Jr. Bench Press record.", "post_ups": 1563, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3ryyda/yesterday_i_bench_pressed_163_kg3593_lbs_821/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:22.278303", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "", "post_created_utc": 1446808641.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "3rr2fu", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 1289, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1554, "post_selftext": "I was wondering if lifting had any benefits other than just gaining muscle mass and strength.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "What benefits does lifting have other than the aesthetics and strength?", "post_ups": 1554, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3rr2fu/what_benefits_does_lifting_have_other_than_the/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:22.278303", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "thattendguy", "post_created_utc": 1367936869.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "1dv2kf", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 659, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1559, "post_selftext": "Jesus Christ ...Have you seen any place in the world with facilities like this?\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fquDTF09bk", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Bama weight room .... my brain just melted!!", "post_ups": 1559, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1dv2kf/bama_weight_room_my_brain_just_melted/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:22.278303", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "_sockinthemachine_", "post_created_utc": 1543947905.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 1, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "a33b65", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 171, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1556, "post_selftext": "The article from the New York Time is [here.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/well/move/even-a-little-weight-training-may-cut-the-risk-of-heart-attack-and-stroke.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur&fbclid=IwAR0CAEP81WPM0VoBeCW-L5uLlK-omATNOLOSSl3l6EAF7KrhR38US5c3TrY) In summary, drawing from a fairly large dataset, researchers concluded that even a fairly small about of weight training cuts the risk of heart attacks and stroke, independently of aerobic exercise being done.

But then another issue is discovered and before long the entire workout is nothing but deloads and corrective exercises.  The trap of chasing perfection snares another victim.  \n\nAdmittedly, this is mostly a rant post from Tony but it highlights an issue rampant in this field.

Spending evenings doing stretches and whatnot for my APT but it turned out the best thing I ever did for that was getting strong(er).

The first week I found myself crying into my chicken nuggets at a Wendy's. My first focus was on portion control and I invested in lean cuisines. I then transitioned away from processed foods and began cooking at home and eating whole foods. I changed my workout routine every few months but began with walking on my treadmill at home. After the first 20lbs I got a gym membership and began cycling and kickboxing classes then transitioned away from the gym and got myself outdoors. Now I jog and dance almost everyday, play soccer every week and swim. My future goals are lowering my bodyfat percentage through cardio and diet so that I can begin leangains. I know it's difficult for women to bulk but I would really like to put on as much muscle as I can and am patiently waiting for the fatloss period to end so that I may start my strength training journey.

[Full album](https://imgur.com/a/TwiJGGT).\n\nAround my heaviest I weighed **290 lbs** (I don't know exactly, I didn't like to weigh myself back then - but I know I broke 280 lbs from a doctor's visit several years ago). Currently I weigh **215 lbs**. And I'm 6' tall.*\n\n### Weight Loss\nI started reducing my food volume intake around January, 2017. My problem is volume. I love *lots* of everything. So, I simply started with smaller portions. Fast forward a few months and I went through an unexpected divorce and didn't feel like eating for the 5-6 months, which is where a lot of the weight loss occurred. Nothing special, just mild depression. I forced myself to take in 800-1000 kcals/day.\n\nLater on, when I start working out, I began eating a lot better. I didn't track calories initially, but I worked my ass of in the gym and tried to only eat whole foods -- nutrition dense, fresh, etc. I got into meal prepping I rarely ate out or drank. \n\nThis year I converted to CICO and weighing/tracking everything in myfitnesspal. I just completed a 12 week routine (more in a minute) while on a cut (1700 kcals/day -- I \"banked\" some calories each day for a cheat meal, [read more here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9h0gxt/weight_loss_and_gym_gains_over_15_years_for_30_yo/e68i2sn/)) and increased strength while losing weight. I did **IF** (first meal at 11 am, last at 9 pm) just to control *when* I was hungry. It's a lot harder to binge/cheat at work. This allowed meals to be more satisfying. I really do believe IF for self-control/discipline + CICO is a really good way to go. \n\nMacros: 35% proteins, 40% fats, 25% carbs.\n\nTypical day:\n\n*  lunch = chicken breast, avacado oil, veggies\n\n* pre-workout  = 2 scoops whey, creatine, idolized salt mixed in coffee; one Nuun tablet in water while working out \n\n* Dinner = fish (tilapia or salmon) spinach salad w/ shaved almonds, olive oil, smaller veggies (peas, carrots, corn, etc), and balsamic vinegar\n\n* Late snack  = yogurt parfait bowl w/ strawberries, blueberries, peanut butter, chia or flax seeds \n\nI try to rotate veggies regularly to not get too bored. Plain yellow mustard and Cholula are my go-to condiments.\n\n### Working out\n\nThen, August 1st 2017, I went to the gym. I originally just focused on building the habit. Get in, move some weights, get out. I don't recall exactly what I did, but I made sure to do 4-5 exercises hitting major parts of my body with dumbbells. After a month of going, I found this sub and the PPL in the wiki. I ran a modified version of it for roughly 7-8 months at a gym that did not allow deadlifts, so I supplemented with extra hamstring work. I switched to the YMCA and started proper deadlifts then.\n\nBy the end of my time doing the PPL, I was stalling on squats (my favorite lift) and someone recommended me [Brain Alsruhe's Breathing and Bracing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLHY2-nt-y4&t=2s). This and his other technique videos changed my perspective and approach to lifting. Ultimately, I bought one of his 12 week Strongman routines and I've just finished it up now.\n\n### What I learned\n\nI have a problem of wanting more, now. I wanted immediate returns. For that reason, I kept adding volume thinking it would get stronger. I hated days off, deloading, etc. But I entered into \"overwork\" and probably hurt some of my gains due to lack of recovery time. **It's not a sprint!** It's OK to take a day off to rest. It's OK to have a controlled refeed on a cut. It's a marathon; be consistent 80%+ of the time and you'll get there. Have a plan and stick to it, but build in some flexibility to allow yourself room to breathe.\n\nAlso... **DON'T** skip what you dislike. If it's hard, you probably need more of it. I skimped on bench press and OHP for the first 6 months or so and they're easily my weakest links now. I did OHP in a smith machine and only DB presses, telling myself that was 'good enough,' which didn't turn out the progress nearly like they have as actual compound lifts with a barbell. I wish I didn't let myself go easy on Press days in the beginning.\n\n**Conditioning won't kill your lifts**. Yes, marathon runners need to run more. Lifters need to lift more. But both groups can benefit from doing some of each. I run a 5k each week and sprint 1 mile 3x/week. Also the routine I just finished has a lot more conditioning built in. Don't skimp on heart health!\n\n### Lifts\n\n* **Deadlift**: 1RM 435 lbs (up from 375 lbs 12 weeks ago; 275 lbs in May)\n\n* **Squat**: 1RM 425 lbs (up from 375 lbs 12 weeks ago; 135 lbs August 2017)\n\n* **OHP**: 1RM 175 lbs (up from 135 lbs 12 weeks ago; 65 lbs August 2017)\n\n* **Bench**: 1RM 265 lbs (up from 225 lbs 12 weeks ago; 115 lbs August 2017)\n\n### What's next?\n\nI really enjoyed the PPL, it was fun cruising through #s initially, and I would like to run it again, but after Brian's routine I'll have a hard time going back to the PPL as I love his Strongman routine. So, for now, my plan is to cut again (I've had about 3 weeks at maintenance) and run Brian's Strongman routine again. \n\nI would like to get down to 200 lbs with a combined big 3 of 1,200 lbs (95 lbs increase) in the next six months.\n\n### Extra (edit2, thought of this later)\n\nThis is all extra and not called for in my routine:\n\nAbout a month ago I started doing 100 heel raises at my desk in the mornings (I've a sit/stand desk) without stopping; 1 second up, hold for 1 second, 1 second down. Repeat. Insane pump/burn. I also train calves my 4 lift days:\n\n* Standing smith machine calf raises on platform for full ROM; 300 lbs 5x10, superset with bodyweight heel raises 5x12 -- 60 seconds rest\n\n* Seated heel raises; 100 lbs 5x16, superset with bodyweigh heel raises 5x10 -- 30 seconds rest\n\n* Smith machine calf raises on platform for full ROM; 230 lbs 5x10, superset with bodyweight heel raises 5x10 -- 10 seconds rest (lighter weight, try to burn through)\n\n* Calf press & hold (leg press machine); 450 lbs 5x10 for 30 seconds, AMRAP heel raises x 5 -- 45 seconds rest \n\nGoing forward I may drop sets to 3-4 as I like where my calves are at now and as I run my next cut they should pop nicely with a reduction in my body fat %.\n\nLuckily my office has a gym, so 2x/day I go walk uphill 5.5% @ 4 mph for .75 mile and then do two sets of 8 pullups. I also try to get in 12-20 pullups in the evenings as I'm doing chores. Brian and a few other YouTubers recommended doing lots of pullups to get good at them, so I do. This is the most I can do without sweating much, so I don't have to change clothes. Doing this I went from a max of 4 strict pullups to 9 strict pullups.\n\nI recently started doing Yoga 1x/week, which has helped me feel great for deadlifts/squats. I may start doing it 2x/week when I begin the routine/cut again.\n\nE: added starting #s from August, 2017; E2: 'extra' info", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Weight loss and gym gains over 1.5 years for 30 YO male -- not there yet, but happy with how far I've come", "post_ups": 1542, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9h0gxt/weight_loss_and_gym_gains_over_15_years_for_30_yo/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:24.288007", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "J-Unleashed", "post_created_utc": 1465115325.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1465140688.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "4mmjtl", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 221, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1536, "post_selftext": "So, I've been browsing this sub for a long time now, and have posted a few times asking questions.\n\nWell, I finally listened to what some of you had to say. This sub stresses that you need to find something that you'll love to do when you're working out. For all the is holy in this sub, if there's one thing you can take for this, FIND A WORKOUT THAT IS FUN for you. Literally, you could stop reading here.\n\nSo, I will go with a backstory. I've worked out many times before, and would workout for 7-9 months, then I would get wrapped up in school. I live lifting, but apparently just living lifting isn't enough. I'm very dedicated to my studies, and I sometimes forget my body needs a workout too. My time in the Army taught me about working out and its importance but obviously their take on fitness never came as smart in terms of how they went about it. Working out the same muscles everyday, and it is such a mystery why I didn't bulk up as much as I could have. /s\n\nSo, at the end of April, I went to the doctor to get a check up. What was my weight? At  65 inches (~165 cm.), I weighed 163 lbs. (~74 kg.). The most I had weighed in my life before that: 153 lbs (~69 kg.). I saw that weight, and I had to take action.\n\nI went home, and started really reflecting on how I wanted to work out. I decided on parkour, found a gym 15 minutes away from me, and began training. I am about to turn 28, and decided that the purpose of this new work out regiment is to get my to try out for American Ninja Warrior. If I make it, I make it, if not, I tried. Fuck that, I want to make it onto American Ninja Warrior, and I will do what I have to (shy of cheating) to make it.\n\nI changed up a lot, and I changed it up quick. I will get to the specifics, but I wanted to post my first month numbers so that I make this a monthly thing. This monthly post will be my way to hold myself accountable.\n\nSo, here are my numbers from April 29th:\n\nWeight: 163 lbs. (according to two scales)\nBMI: 24.4\nBody Fat Percentage: 17.3%\nCalculated Weight in Fat: 36.6 lbs. (~16 kg.)\nCalculated Skeletal and Muscular Weight: 117.4 lbs.(~53 kg.)\n\nAs of May 31st, here are my one-month results:\nWeight: 147 lbs. (67 kg.)\nBMI: I seem to have not written it down, so I don't know.\nBody Fat Percentage: 11.9%\nCalculated Weight in Fat: 17.4 lbs. (~7.9 kg.)\nCalculated Skeletal and Muscular Weight: 129.2 lbs. (~58 kg.)\n\nSo, here is what I did this entire month.\n\nI started going to bed early. I'm in bed between 2100 or 2200 on the week days, and I'm awake by 0530. I take this time to take my dog for a run. I run with her for about 45 minutes to an hour. When I get home, I shower, eat breakfast, and clean up my apartment. If you want to talk about being triumphant, imagine having your housework done by 0730, and you're more than ready for the day.\n\nFrom about 0730 to 1100 or 1300 (depending on the day), I spend that time studying for my classes. I use this time to rewrite my notes (if I haven't already), watch videos, and do problems. After classes, I take my dog for walk #2, but this walk lasts about 30 minutes because she's pretty much over it by this time. I try to take her for evening walks before 1900.\n\nEveryday at 1600, I head to the gym. My gym has a small weight room and plenty of obstacles for me to climb on. I have utilized every free training session I was promised. I typically will lift weights for 45 or so minutes, then go run around on the obstacles. I was that kid who always played on the monkey bars and jungle gyms at school. So, this was just like that. And, I am not confined to a recess bell, so I can play around for a while if I want.\n\nIf there's a day I don't feel like driving to the gym (it only happened twice this month) I went for a run (at least 4 miles). After a 4-mile run, you'd be surprised at how little guilt you have after a good run. I have been working out 6 days per week, and using my rest day for hot tub time. I have two less tough days throughout the week at the gym (Tuesdays and Friday).\n\nMy diet has substantially changed. I first deduced that sodas had to go. So, I allowed myself 4 sodas for the month of April, and 4 sodas I did consume, and now that I think of it, I haven't even had my first soda for this month, and so let's see if I can last until my birthday (June 19th) without consuming a soda.\n\nI've been eating like crazy.\n\nMy breakfast typically entails any combination of cereal, eggs, oatmeal, and/or fruit. I don't drink coffee, so I drink chocolate milk with my breakfast, or orange juice.\n\nMy lunches comprise of sandwiches (tuna or turkey), some steamed broccoli and tuna.\n\nMy dinner is typically chicken or some ground turkey.\n\nSnacks are pretty bad, because I am not really the best with cooking. I'm always open to suggestions. I am always looking for snacks to eat. I currently much on trail mix or fruit. I need more protein to start stepping up.\n\nMy question and concerns:\n\n1.) What are some suggestions you have for food and meal preps? I've been trying to stick to poultry.\n\n2.) What protein shake recipe suggestions do you have?\n\n3.)  My numbers come off as weird, so I'm curious as to whether I've been lied to, and if I have been, do I really want to know?\n\n4.) Snack suggestions?\n\n5.) Others who are doing parkour, what guidance do you have for me? I'm here to learn. Teach me. I want to do a competitive even within a year, and I will do it.\n\nHere are my fitness goals for the month of June:\n\nBench 185 lbs. (I can bench 135)\nSquats 205 lbs. (I can squat 155)\nPull ups: 15 consecutive \nBackflip: fine tune (I can stick one, but I want to get the technique down).\nI will time a one-time run to see what my mile time looks like.\n\nWell, this does it for my first progress post. I look forward to reading your advice and critiques. Don't pull punches. I've never wanted to do something like this before, and I want to succeed. Thank you.\n\nEDIT: I appreciate everyone helping me sort out my numbers.  If my numbers are tough to wrap your head around, tell me. I'd rather hear the hard truth that my numbers are bullshit and why they're inaccurate, as opposed to living in a delusion that I can burn that much off.\n\nSecond EDIT: a couple of redditors think ive made some mistakes in my post. So, they are helping me figure out exactly how much weight in fat that I lost, as well as what exactly did I lose. /u/_DrFeltersnatch has pointed out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4mmjtl/i_caught_myself_slipping_into_obesity_as_a_result/d3wvhy9).

In his book *Strength And How To Obtain It*, Sandow lists photos and routines of some of his students and their progress after his coaching. \n\n- The bench press (and by virtue, dumbbell press on a bench) was not invented and popularised until the mid 1930s, meaning any floor pressing with barbell or dumbbell was triceps-dominant. This is why the only chest exercises Sandow has are: push ups, banded push ups, and standing dumbbell flys. Regardless of Sandow's claim that he wanted to emulate statues, or the theory that big chests were perceived as feminine, it begs the questions of if they would have even been able to build a [modern chest](https://i.imgur.com/Ue07rI5.jpg) (Steve Reeves, late 1940s-early 1950s) with the limited equipment and knowledge they possessed in 1890s/1900-20s \n\n- Many of his depicted exercises are now or can be replicated with cable machines, such as: lateral bicep curls, standing chest flys, deltoid raises, \n\n- His contraptions for weighted push ups or his leg workouts included tightening mechanisms to increase the tension of the cables. \n\n- There are a lot of shoulder-dominant movements: front and lateral deltoid raises, shoulder presses (OHP, bent oblique press), weighted deltoid holds, weighted swings, dumbbell lunge punches, barbell raises.

Some people say that is good as it makes the muscles look comparatively bigger but that hasn't been the case so far. \n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the replies everyone! This has definitely inspired me. I have never managed to go to the gym for more than 6 weeks in a row but now I see that progress is slow (compared to my naive expectations) but it definitely seems to be worth it! I'll keep it up and try to eat twice as much as I do at the moment!

In my experience as a personal trainer I just wanna go over a few things that really bothered me with regards to how gym members, and personal training clients in particular, are treated and deceived by major corporate gyms.  I\u2019ll list my qualifications in the following paragraph, and then get into my grievances.\n\nI graduated from UCSB in Ca where I studied accounting and sports and exercise science.  The following year I got my NASM personal training certification and worked as a personal trainer while I studied for my CPA accounting exams.  For a year and a half I worked at a major national gym, as well as my own training business.  As far as I know, most of the large corporate gyms are more or less the same as far as how they treat clients.  Obviously, there are some differences and some are worse than others.  I have also taught group classes, coached high school basketball/volleyball, and was briefly the athletic trainer for a professional basketball team in Bangkok.  I had a great rapport with all my clients, dealt with them honestly, and after I became aware of unscrupulous activity no longer accepted clients from the sales team.  Since then I will never train for one of these corporate gyms, nor will I allow them to earn any revenue from any of my actions, directly or indirectly.\n\nThe Sales Process: \n\nIn most situations the sales team and the personal training personnel are two completely different departments in the gym.  Sales persons feed the training staff new clients and are paid commission as long as they hit their target quota, if the quota isn\u2019t met they are paid minimum wage.  Sales can be quite lucrative, however if the target isn\u2019t hit, they are essentially working 12 hour days 6 days a week for about 8 bucks an hour.  With that being said the Sales team is under ridiculous pressure to sell training sessions, and often time shady practices are undertaken.  Additionally, and even more unsettling; they are in no way required to be certified, and are seldom qualified to give any sort of health related advice.  Yet, with no clinical information they will tell you, you are in imminent danger of heart disease.  They will be hyper critical of your weight and ask you how much weight you want to lose before you are comfortable with yourself.  They will say just about anything to make you feel like you need training.  Most gyms will offer a \u201cfree consultation from a personal trainer\u201d in order to rope you into a contract.  9 times out of 10 the person leading this \u201cconsultation\u201d was not a personal trainer, nor was the interaction a real consultation.  In general, They would start off with an arbitrary method of body fat measurement: BMI index, tape measure or bioelectrical impedance (the cheap little body fat machine you hold in your hand);  all three methods being the least accurate in terms of giving an accurate reading.  Usually the one that gives the most advantageous (whichever makes you fattest) reading is used.  They were instructed by management to tell potential clients they need to reach unhealthy and unrealistic goals; for example, a good target goal for a woman of 27% body fat is 8% (whereby 27% is average and can be healthy, and 8% is anorexic and dangerous).  After the consultation they move on to a training session, which at my gym jovially referred to as \u201chazing\u201d.  This being a horribly unsafe means of pushing a potential client to their limits (again with no reference to their prior medical history) in order to show them that they cannot exercise on their own and they are grossly out of shape.  It also was not uncommon for the sales person to flat out lie about the terms and rates of a training contract; Really, you need to be on your guard because in general, the sales person is under a ton of pressure to sell, and there are institutional problems that encourage unethical behavior.  \n\nPersonal Training:\n\nThe minimum qualification for a personal trainer to work at many of these major corporate gyms is a personal training certification.  Depending on the gym this can range from a cert. that can be obtained online in under two weeks, to a certification that takes 3-6 months to prepare for.  I personally have a NASM certification, and is regarded as one of the best.  However, this is not at all sufficient in terms of assessing one\u2019s knowledge.  The major problem with this particular certification is that NASM has a profit motive, meaning they make more money by selling more tests.  There is an economic advantage to having people fail; a lower pass rate implies a more prestigious cert. and obviously people pay to retake the exam.  Personally, found that the exam focused way too much on semantics rather than assessing knowledge of the body and training.  Ideally, I\u2019d like to see a governing body without a profit motive certifying personal trainers.  The fact is, training is can be a very dangerous business.  If your trainer is unqualified or under qualified, there is way too much potential to make existing health problems worse or develop new ones or create new or exacerbate existing muscle imbalances.  Far too often I saw my colleagues guiding their clients through exercises incorrectly or having them do things that were extremely compromising to the body structurally.  \n\nNutrition:\n\nPersonal Trainers, are, in general, not qualified to give nutritional or supplement advice.  We are not nutritionists and should not be advising (outside of basic nutritional knowledge) unless we have some sort of history in nutrition.  We do not have access to your medical history, and even if we did there\u2019s no guarantee that we\u2019d give you proper advice.  This fact is especially disturbing when giving supplement advice (some trainers at gyms are required to sell supplements and have monthly quotas).  This is extremely frightening given many supplements can affect heart functioning and have very little government oversight in terms of safety.  \n\nContractual issues pertaining to my gym:\n\nFar too often, clients are overcharged.  My gym only offered 30 minute sessions, and depending on the sale or promotion the price ranged from $20-60/session.  Which means clients were paying 40-120 dollars an hour for often times, under qualified training.  I personally charged 30-40 for my private clients, which was an average rate for my area.  From each session the trainer would take $8; and are effectively making 15 dollars an hour taxed.  Unfortunately, when many of my colleagues became aware of this discrepancy (at times the gym could net 112 vs. the trainers\u2019 8 per session) they\u2019d become disgruntled and take it out on their clients either with attitude or providing terrible service.  Canceling memberships or training was always a ridiculous hassle.  In order to cancel, clients were required to physically mail notification to the corporate office and the vast majority of the time, the notice would get \u201clost\u201d ensuring another months of sessions/membership.  If there was no notification, they would continue to charge members\u2019 credit cards, even after the contract period.  And of course, the contract rarely agreed with what the sales person promised.  \n\nOther problems:\n\nThere were also a number of instances where a few \u201cbad apple\u201d trainers/sales persons would steal, overcharge or participate in some sort of illegal activity against clients/members.  I understand that these are actions taken on the part of individuals, but the gym  could have tightened their internal controls or taken other measures to prevent these things from happening.  The problem is, unethical and dishonest behavior is indirectly encouraged from the top down within the corporation and in my experience is far too prevalent in the industry.\n\nThings to do to protect yourself:\n\n1.\tAlways ask your trainer/sales person their background.  It\u2019s not rude at all.  It is your body they are working with and your health at risk, you have every right to know their qualifications.\n2.\tTry to pay with cash whenever you can.  This prevents them from charging you past the contract period, and from overcharging you.  If a gym says you cannot, chances are they are being dishonest and I\u2019d call their bluff.\n3.\tIf possible ask a trainer if they\u2019ll train you independent of a gym contract, you\u2019ll pay less money and they\u2019ll earn more.\n4.\tAlways ask for a copy of your contract and read it.  Generally there\u2019s a buyer\u2019s remorse period and you can get out with very little penalty.  It\u2019s generally company policy to not give you a copy unless you ask, something about it being better for the environment to go paperless.  \n5.\tIf you have questions r/fitness, and even more so r/askscience are great resources,  both are smart communities and it\u2019s always a great idea to have people crosschecking each other.  \n6.\tDon\u2019t take any shit from sales people, if they are willing to bully you chances are they don\u2019t know what they are talking about, the gym is no place for bullying; if anything you should be encouraged.  \n\nI\u2019ll be around for a while, and am open and happy to answer any questions or clarify anything\n\nTL;DR\n1.\tSales people are dishonest and not qualified to tell you what you need\n2.\tOften times trainers are under qualified \n3.\tSuggestions to help you from getting screwed.\n4.

Last time I managed to weigh myself, in May, I was 175, but I've lost a few more inches since then, so it's likely I've lost a bit more weight too. My starting measurements were 46-36-46, and now I'm down to 37-29-39, so I've basically lost at least 7 inches in my circumference this year! (My dress size dropped from a size 16/18 to a size 8/10, and I've even fit into some size 6s, albeit less flatteringly.)\n\n[me holding the measuring tape where it used to be](http://i.imgur.com/zjCO0.png)\n\nI started lurking on fittit/loseit last June, and seeing normal people achieving extraordinary things really kick-started my journey. I decided to make exercise and my fitness a priority, and committed to doing it AT LEAST every 2 days, often more. I had to start slow, because, well, as my pictures would suggest I was extremely sedentary and obese. \n\nI use the TRX (www.trxtraining.com), which uses your body weight for strength training. I use it at home, which means no excuses not to do it, which was one of my biggest issues; working out from home helped me keep up my routine long-term. However, it is an expensive system for what it is. I had been previously introduced to it through my old kickboxing gym and got it on sale (they generally offer 25% around Christmastime), but there's a LOT of suspension trainer DIY tutorials online that you should check out if suspension training interests you. In terms of cardio exercise, I walk a lot more (and enjoy spending hours going on walks), take the stairs (and walk up escalators), bike a lot in the summer. I'm much more into building muscle (I get really excited to show people I haven't seen for awhile my new biceps, for example!). \n\nI took the advice \"eat less, move more\" to heart, and while I don't count calories, I do eat significantly smaller portions, and less junk food overall. I buy a lot more fruits and veggies, but I don't deprive myself of the things I'm craving. \n\nI've still got a bit more to lose, probably around 10-15 pounds, but these are more vanity pounds off my stomach and thighs than anything. I'm basically at a healthy BMI (1-2 pounds over last time I checked my weight in May), and I'm starting to feel good about my body and fitness. I'm currently stalling with my weight loss (but am still losing inches very slowly, so I can't reaaally call it a plateau). I'm considering intermittent fasting to take my diet to the next level and lose these last pounds.

I started to run and eat right during the week. The weight started shedding off and I kept true to my regiment no matter what. I was in great shape before I even knew it.

Today I'd like to share how far I've come in the year that I've been on Reddit. I'd like to preface this with the fact that I am mostly a lurker on this sub, but I've been here and certainly appreciate every last bit of the advice given out here. I have learned a **ton.**\n\nWithout further ado, [here is my progress](https://imgur.com/gallery/U7f5i)\n\n#General Info\n\nIn my before photos, I am of the following stats\n\nHeight: 5'7.5\" (171.45 cm)\n\nWeight: 121 pounds (54.88 kg)\n\nBench max: 75 pounds (34.02 kg)\n\nThat's all I know for lifts, I was too embarrassed to properly benchmark myself. I can tell you they were very very weak.\n\nAfter, I am of the following\n\nHeight: 5'8\" (172.72 cm)\n\nWeight: 146 pounds (66.22 kg)\n\nBench max: 185 pounds\n\nSquat 5RM\\*: 200 pounds\n\nDeadlift 5RM\\*: 185 pounds\n\nI have asterisks there because they're untrained. I'll get to why that is when talking about training, and what a perfect segue..\n\n#Training\n\nHere is one of the biggest things I've ever learned. Don't start using the machines in a fitness room. Don't try and make your own program. Just get in the weightroom and follow a proven lifting regiment. My squat and DL are low because I was a frequent hiker/climber and figured lower body would be fine. Here's what I started out doing.\n\n10 push ups, 10 sit ups, ten curls, one minute plank, repeat that four times with a 2 minute rest halfway through. After that I would do whatever I wanted on the machines in the fitness room. It's better than being on the couch, but I should've just gone to the weightroom. I always thought people would just judge me. That is NOT the case.\n\nNow, I've been in the actual weightroom since January, and following [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/OZeif) program. Things that are not marked are accessories, I will finish this and do whatever I feel I should work on even further. Every time, this includes tricep extensions, as well as more pull ups or dips or forearm exercises for grip strength when I'm climbing. Just whatever else.\n\nFor core, which is also not marked, I'll do up to four sets of 24 situps, 1 minute plank, and 12 v-sits. Then I'll head over to the pull up bar and do 3x10 leg raises. Core progression is certainly something I need to work on in the future.\n\nHere's my workout weights\n\nBench: 3x10@135 or 5x5@155\n\nSquat: 3x10@185\n\nDead Lift: 3x10@185 (note for both Squat and Dead Lift I haven't maxed because I don't feel they're trained enough yet to bother. Once they get stronger, I will.)\n\nOHP: 3x10@75 definitely needs work.\n\nBar Rows: 3x10@115 or 5x5@135\n\nGoblet Squat: 3x10@100 pound dumbell. Holy shit these get my breathing rate up. Love these.\n\n#Diet\n\nI do not watch my calories. I eat when I'm hungry, and I don't eat when I'm not. I have an unidentified digestive disease and as a result, have to stay away from all fast food, and severely limit things considered junk food like ice cream and candy. Because of all that, my diet is what I would consider pretty clean. The only time it is not clean is in the summer. I work at a summer camp, so for ten weeks my diet consists of whatever bargain bin grub the chefs budget can afford. Really kills it for me, and I feel like hell, but it's only ten weeks.\n\nDay to day, I eat a lot of chicken, eggs, peanut butter, milk, almonds, Mini Wheats, fruit, stuff like that. Like I said, I don't bother with bulking or cutting, just eat when I want to.\n\nAfter I lift I mix a protein shake with that peanut butter cup Body Fortress stuff. God damn, it's good. That's the only supplement I take.\n\n#Goals\n\nI'm nearing my first weight goal of 150 pounds, and I'm hoping to be at 160 by January. Ultimately, I'd like to hit 170 and see what I want to do from there. I'd like to hit a two plate bench by year's end, and just continue to improve my general fitness!\n\n#Summary!\n\nSince I've started lifting, I'm SO much more confident and happy with myself than I ever thought I could be. I always told myself I'd never be good enough, strong enough, or amount to much. Now, I feel so much more strong and confident. I should have started in the weightroom much earlier than I did.\n\nIf there's somebody there who wants to start, do it! Nobody in the weightroom will judge you, and you're going to be beating everyone on the couch! Don't wait until tomorrow, don't wait until Monday. (Even though it's currently Monday, you know what I mean.)\n\nI'm really happy with where I am now and ecstatic to continue, but if you look like me in the before picture, you can do better than I did! Follow a regiment right away and by the end of one year, you can be even further! Start! Go! Blow my results out of the water!\n\nI'm rooting for every single one of you guys, you're all excellent people and I believe in every last one of you.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "One year, 25 pounds greater, and lessons I've learned", "post_ups": 1533, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/67cpub/one_year_25_pounds_greater_and_lessons_ive_learned/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:24.288007", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "daudnighthawk", "post_created_utc": 1446154584.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1446243096.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "3qrch8", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 409, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1539, "post_selftext": "[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUEJsVNCW8)\n\nFinally hit 225lbs!

I weighed in at 130.2lbs after this lift.\n\nI just got into powerlifting also.

I was about halfway through my second rep when someone tapped on my shoulder. It was the gym supervisor - an older gentleman. In rapid Spanish (which I barely understood, but I got the gist of it) he explained that my form was off and helped to correct me. \n\nI mentioned to him that it was often difficult for me to get the form totally correct because I had trouble balancing on my heels and that I tended to put most of my weight on the outside of my feet, even when I walk. He immediately grabbed some equipment and showed me a few exercises to help me balance my weight better, and ended up spending about half an hour making sure I understood the exercises and giving me pointers.\n\nWhile I was working on his suggested exercises on my own, I noticed that a lot of the students in the gym approached him - he was constantly talking to people and giving them pointers on a variety of things. Everyone seemed receptive and thankful for the help, and I could tell that it was a pretty normal deal for him to spend his time working with them instead of just sitting at his desk, scanning student ID's.\n\nEven though I only understand Spanish passably well - which he recognized - he took the time and effort to help me correct my form and balance. I realized how much I appreciated that gesture. He wanted to help out because he enjoyed it and wanted us to get the most out of our workouts.

The 1000 lb club!\n\n\n**EDIT**\n\nYou can find most of my answers to questions in the comments below, but I just wanted to add a FAQ to answer some common questions that were posted in the comments. \n\n* How much did it all cost?\n\nSome of the equipment (the treadmill, elliptical, and bench) were bought years ago. If memory serves the treadmill was ~$1500 and the elliptical was ~$800. The bench is just a cheap one that I bought last year for $200, I will be replacing it with a Body-solid Incline/decline bench soon. The power rack with the lat attachment and 210 lb weight stack was $1200, the dip/leg lift station was $330, the ab board was $260. The Bowflex SelectTech 1090s were $600 + $130 for the stand. The Olympic bar, weight tree, and 350 lbs of olympic weights was around $700. The PC was ~$500, the corner PC desk was $100, and the 5.1 receiver (wt. speakers included) was $350. The TV was \"borrowed\" from another room in the house :) On to the room itself, the flooring was ~$700, it's a quality laminate (I wanted laminate instead of hardwood as it's much easier to lay and it's much more durable). I have all my receipts for the room materials, etc, but I can't really get into the detailed breakdown of the room costs because it would take too long but overall it cost around $12K to complete the room from start to finish with all equipment and furnishings.\n\n* How are you going to Deadlift without breaking the floor?\n\nThe floor sits on a concrete slab, so I don't have to worry about the weight. I will do as many suggested and pick up a few heavy rubber mats, and double or even triple them up to protect the floor.\n\n* How do you learn a skill like this/are you a contractor?\n\nIt came fairly naturally to me. I just always loved working with wood and I'm rather methodical so it's right up my alley. In the past I've built many rooms (bedrooms, offices, etc.), a playground for my kids, an elaborate deck off my house in my back yard, etc. I'm not a contractor, I just really enjoy this kind of stuff.\n\n* Why no mirrors?\n\nIn time. Just haven't had the chance to get any yet.\n\n* How do you manage overhead press, push presses, etc. with such low ceilings?\n\nI don't :( Unfortunately I am somewhat limited in what I can do with this space as it's only 7'9\" tall. So I have to settle with seated military/overhead presses instead of standing. Also, while pull-ups can be done on the rack, I have a separate pull-up bar in an adjacent room that has no drywall so it gives me a bit more clearance.\n\n\nThat's all for now. If any other questions arise I will add those. Thank you all for your kind words, it is *really* appreciated, and I hope this inspires some of you to build a dream gym of your own.\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Built a home Gym!", "post_ups": 1532, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1jl66i/built_a_home_gym/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:24.288007", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "GreenLump", "post_created_utc": 1479042483.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1479045153.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "5cpv0t", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 719, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1532, "post_selftext": "Don't have specific goals other than staying fit, healthy and keeping my anxiety at bay.

This, in my opinion, is irresponsible on Coca-Cola's part, and if you read the article, you'll see that their ties and relationship with this research runs deep. It may not be a stretch to use the word \"corruption\" here.\n\nJust to be clear...\n\n- I do believe that exercise is important to a healthy lifestyle\n- I do believe that exercise can help combat obesity\n- I do believe that scientific studies which look at the relationship between exercise and obesity are valuable\n- No I do not think that you must avoid all sugary filled soda to enjoy a healthy lifestyle\n\nUltimately the problem here is Coca-Cola actively funding and promoting a seemingly large initiative to convince others that the solution to obesity is exercise, not diet.\n\n> Coca-Cola, the world\u2019s largest producer of sugary beverages, is backing a new \u201cscience-based\u201d solution to the obesity crisis: To maintain a healthy weight, get more exercise and worry less about cutting calories.\n\n> ...\n\n> weight-conscious Americans are overly fixated on how much they eat and drink while not paying enough attention to exercise.\n\n> ...\n\n> \u201cMost of the focus in the popular media and in the scientific press is, \u2018Oh they\u2019re eating too much, eating too much, eating too much\u2019 \u2014 blaming fast food, blaming sugary drinks and so on,\u201d the group\u2019s vice president, Steven N. Blair, an exercise scientist, says in a recent video announcing the new organization. \u201cAnd there\u2019s really virtually no compelling evidence that that, in fact, is the cause.\u201d\n\nA quote from [Global Energy Balance Network](https://gebn.org), the research group that is largely funded by Coca-Cola (with the domain itself registered to Coca-Cola).\n\n> Energy balance is not yet fully understood, but there is strong evidence that it is easier to sustain at a moderate to high level of physical activity (maintaining an active lifestyle and eating more calories). Not many people can sustain energy balance at a low level of physical activity (maintaining a sedentary lifestyle and eating fewer calories), as attempts to restrict calorie intake over the long term are likely to be ineffective.\n\nThe second half of the article does a good job at setting the record straight, with quotes from other doctors/scientists and studies which focus on diet to combat obesity, not exercise.\n\n---------------\n\nUPDATE: Global Energy Balance Network has [backpedaled a little bit](https://gebn.org/news/home/item/64-james-hill-statement?utm_content=bufferd6d7f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)\n\n> **James O. Hill, Ph.D., President, Global Energy Balance Network:**\n\n> Recent media reports suggesting that the work of my colleagues and me promotes the idea that exercise is more important than diet in addressing obesity vastly oversimplifies this complex issue. As a researcher on weight control and obesity for more than 25 years, the author of two books on the subject and co-founder of the National Weight Control Registry, I can say unequivocally that diet is a critical component of weight control, as are exercise, stress management, sleep, and environmental and other factors.

Slice the lemons, put some slices of lemon in the chicken. Cut and dice the mushrooms and onion. Leave the green herbs whole on the stick, crush the garlic gloves.\n\nTake some tinfoil, fold it a couple of times till reasonable thick sheet, make a sorta enveloppe from it. (fold over, fold in sides, close the last one when everything is in).\nPut the chicken in here, (one breast per enveloppe), put some more lemon slices on top of it. Put the herbs, some garlic and the onion/ mushroom mixture on top. Pour some white whine in (ad some lemon juice for more tangy flavor if you want). Close the enveloppe. Don;t worry the white whine is only there for flavor and steaming, alcohol will be gone after the cooking.\n\nPut in the oven, and let is sit for 35/45 minutes on medium heat (cooking time depends on oven and thickness of chicken.)\n\n**Chicken in Red**\n\n* Chicken breasts\n* tomatoes\n* onion\n* sambal\n* Ketjap manis\n* canned or self made tomato puree\n* garlic\n* Laos, Ketoembar, Djahe\n\nCut the onions, let them shimmer in some coconut oil on medium heat till light brown.

Add the diced tomato, and mix this well. When this is done, add a small squirt of ketjap manis, stir well. Now you should have a sticky, good smelling boemboe (herb paste). Add the (diced) chicken, and stir so all the paste covers the chicken. Turn heat up a bit. Bake for a couple of minutes, add the rest of the diced tomatoes, some water, and the tomato puree.  Leaf heat on to before boiling, then turn down and let it shimmer. The longer you let it shimmer, the more juice and tasty it will become. Don't feel like staying this long in the kitchen?

It is dead cheap, made from ordinary wheat.100 gram of seitan will provide you whit 120 kcal,  24,8 grams of protein and 0.2 grams of fat. You can buy it premade, but I would suggest getting a big bag of seitan fix, and making it yourself. Just add water, kneed to a dough, form balls, and boil in some bouillon for 20 minutes. \nThen you can cut it to pieces and add it to any stir fry, stew etc.\nI like to make mine, then stir fry ti with sugar peas, some lentils, mushrooms and add some salty soy sauce and hoi sin for taste.\n\n*For bulk*\n\n**Chicken and Turkey Roll**\n\n* Turkey breast\n* ketjap manis\n* chicken or cow grinded meat\n* mushrooms\n* lilly flowers\n* pickels\n* onions\n* sambal\n* ketjap manis\n* shrimps\n* toatjo (black bean paste [link](http://www.tokoasiaonline.nl/mee-chun-taotjo-bean-sauce-250gr.html)\n* leak\n*bacon\n\nDice the leak and onion, very very finely.

You'll make excuses all day and it will be hanging over your head that you aren't going to lift.\n\nThese are just my thoughts, and why I changed from after work lifts to before work.

You definitely want to be lifting as big as posssible without gaining any fat.  Most people will set a goal in the 20-30lbs of muscle gained and aim for about 6% body fat over the first semester. \n\nHere's the program:\n\n**Workout drink**:\nMuscle milk in a shaker bottle.  \n\n**Warm up**:\nCardio machine for 20 mins. Middle row machine or behind the best yoga pants.  Don't sweat too much in case you see some ladies to talk to.\n\n**Lifts / Reps / Weight**:\n\n* **Smith Machine Squats** / 2x20 / just the bar (don't want the legs to get too big so you can get that V taper!)\n* **Squat Rack Curls** / 4 sets to failure / heaviest weight you can get. (Gotta build those guns)\n* **Barbell Bench Press** / 3 sets at 1RM / get your max on the bar so people dont make fun of you. its a psychological thing.\n* **\"Skinny Indian Guy\" Psychokinetic Chest Press** / 4 mins / No weight. You do this exercise by putting your body weight in plates on the hammer tech machine (about 120 lbs) and then staring at it while slouching. Don't worry, you will figure out how it works eventually. In the meantime you can psych yourself up.\n* **Dumbell Rack Dumbell Curls** / 2 sets to fail / Find a weight you can do 12 reps with then add 15 lbs to that. Make sure to get as close to the rack as possible. Gotta be alpha and claim your spot in the gym, while u build those guns bro!\n* **Conversation Curls** / 1 min or 3 sentences / Find the biggest dude in the gym and try to talk to him while he's deadlifting. For the advanced version ask him how long until he's done when he's in the middle of his set.\n* **Cable Machine** / 3 sets 12 reps / find any cable machine and pull on it for a little while. Make sure to get some protein in.\n* **Arched Back Deadlift** / 2 sets 5 reps or to injury / Add an extra plate onto the bar so you can get big quicker. Don't worry about form, just make sure it gets off the ground\n* **Standing Dumbbell Bicep Curls** / 2 sets 10 reps / use one size smaller than u did for Rack Dumbbell Curls since this is for hypertrophy. Arms are the first thing a woman sees.\n* **Crunches** / Do about 50 on the exercise ball next to the cardio machines so you can be seen.\n\n**Diet:**\n\nU will see a lot of diet advice on the internet but just ignore it because 1. u don't wanna get too fat and 2. you gotta be able to account for the Natty Light at the house parties. What u wanna do is get almost entirely protein. So buy two tubs of muscle milk when the loan check arrives and then supplement with casein. Don't use creatine cause it will make you bloated! Your fat will come from pizza and just assume that your carbs will come from any alcohol calories. \n\n**Gym etiquette**:\n\n1. Never take your sunglasses off. You have to keep from being distracted and the women won't know you're staring\n2. If someone takes more than 30 seconds after a set they're probably done with that equipment so you can go ahead and move their stuff.\n3. Unused incline benches are the perfect place to sit and talk to your friends.\n4. ENJOY THE MIRIN BITCHES AND GETTING HUGE!! \n\n**Resources**:\nPretty much anything on Bodybuilding.com supplements section is going to be a good choice. Just make sure to always keep that body fat below 6%. ALWAYS CUT BEFORE YOU BULK! This is pragmatic because the best parties are in the fall so you don't have time to turn into a fat fuck if you are going to get laid.\n\n###**EDIT: If this sounds like you then welcome to r/fitness where we will help you abandon the broscience.

Arguably I may have looked even fatter at around 120kg @ 5'8''-5'9'' => http://i.imgur.com/UKZX9Aa.jpg . Either way it was bad and the fact I was spending around 98% of my free time playing World of Warcraft was not helping at all. After ~5 years of grinding my life away online I kinda lost interest in the game and decided that it's time to make a change - I was out of breath after going up a few flights of stairs or if I walked at anything above very slow pace.\n\nIt was about the 2nd week of June 2011 when I decided to be stubborn and to start dieting - now when I look back I see A LOT of BIG mistakes I made when I approached this issue - so, until the end of that month (2 and a half weeks, give or take a few days) I ate ONLY cucumbers and curd. Yes. Only cucumbers and curd.. When I think about it, before that point I must've been consuming around 3000 kcal/day easily - a lot of fizzy drinks, sweets, and foods that contain a lot of fat - especially fast foods.So, that being said after I started my improvised diet, I cut my daily caloric intake to about 1000 kcal. That created a rough deficite of about 2k calories less than what my body was used to. \n\nIn the start of July I started consuming carbs (beans, lentils, quinoa, buckwheat, sweet potatoes, rice and brown pasta - those were all of the carbs I ate at that time) and lean meat (chicken breast mostly). -- It should be duly noted that back then I had no idea what macros were and I did not count calories. -- I was limiting my carb intake to 1 meal per day ( lunch ) and I did not consume any food after 18:00 h. I also started doing cardio - at first I was aiming to walk about 7-10 kilometers (4 - 6 miles) a day and after maybe 3 weeks I started using the elliptical trainer I have at home. **I forgot to include that I was drinking 4-5 L of water a day since the few first days of starting dieting - this continued until October**. So, I continued like that until the second week of September - at that point I already lost about 85 pounds - I was weighing in @ 189 lbs (86 kg) : http://imgur.com/a/gL8nd - The photo was taken on the 12th of October 2011, but my weight remained the same till then.\n\nA few days after this shot I decided that it's time to start going to the gym, so I began working out 4 times/week, doing circuit training for the first month and a half and after that I switched it up to : Monday - Chest/biceps ; Wednesday - Back/triceps ; Friday - Shoulders ; Sunday - Legs. When I think about it now, I was basically wasting my time - I wasn't counting calories, my protein/carb/fat intake was extremely low and I did about 95% of all exercises completely wrong, but still I did put on a few pounds of muscle.. I was pretty much slacking off for a year and a half, thinking I was doing something.. This is the only picture I have from that period - it's taken on the 8th of March 2013 - http://imgur.com/a/jCKSS - I'm weighing in @ about 200 lbs (90 kg). A month after that picture was taken I stopped going to the gym altogether due to university entry-exams and kinda being lazy.\nFor the rest of 2013 and the majority of 2014 i worked out very sporadically - one week I went to the gym 2-3 times, the other I didn't go at all.. \n\nAt the end of 2014 ( maybe in November ) I decided to dedicate myself to getting in the best shape possible so I decided to take a few pictures the day before I started working out consistently - http://imgur.com/a/38TzE - it's taken in the middle of November 2014.\nFor the first month I was doing circuit training 4 times a week. My lifts were pretty miserable - \nBench press 1RM = 165 lbs (75 kg)\nDeadlift 1RM = 154 lbs (70 kg)\nSquat 1RM = 132 lbs (60 kg)\nBent-over BB rows 1RM = 154 lbs (70 kg)\netc.\n\nI couldn't do a single pull-up/dip, more than 5 push-ups. It was pretty demotivating.\nAfter the 1st month of circuit training, I started going 5 times/week in which I trained every muscle group once - Chest/Back/Arms/Shoulders/Legs. I was doing this for about 5 months.\n\nIn the middle of 2015 I started doing my current routine ( with which I'm extremely happy with) :\n\n**-Monday** : Pulling motions. In this day I do 6 exercises for back, 2 for biceps and 2 for traps with weights corresponding to 85-95% of my 1RM : \n\n*BACK* Bent-over BB rows - 5x5 @ 330 lbs (150 kg), \n            5x10 Wide-grip lat pulldown @ 242 lbs (110 kg), \n            4x8 T-bar row with handle @ 200 lbs (95 kg), \n            4x10-12 Seated cable rows @ 225 lbs (100 kg), \n            5x10 Straight-arm pulldown @ 25 lbs (100 kg), \n            4x8 Full range of motion cable lat pulldown @ 176 lbs (80 kgs); \n\n*BICEPS* 5x5 EZ-bar curl @ 160 lb (72.5-75 kg), \n               5x8 Incline DB hammer curls @ 60 lbs (25 kgs); \n\n*TRAPS* Calf-machine shoulder shrugs and DB shrugs.\n\n**-Tuesday**: Pushing motions. In this day I do 6 exercises for chest, 2 for triceps and 1 for legs and 1 for shoulders if I have the time :\n\n*Chest* BB bench press 3x5 @ 245 lbs (110 kg) + 7x3 @ 265 lbs (120 kg) (*My 1 RM on bench press is currently 310 lb (140 kg)), \n            Incline DB bench press 4x8 @ 80 lbs (35 kg) OR 5x5 @ 90 lb (40 kg), \n            SUPERSET Weighted dips 5x8 @ 60 lbs (25 kg) + DB Pullover 5x8 @ 90 lb (40 kg), \n            SUPERSET DB flyes 5x10 @ 60 lbs (25 kg) + Low cable crossover 5x10 @ 60 lbs (25 kg), \n            + If I feel I have the strenght I do a few supersets of pec-deck + max push-ups.; \n\n*TRICEPS* 5x5 Decline EZ-Bar extention @ 160 lb (72.5-75 kg), \n                 5x12 Triceps push-down w/ the V-bar @ 210 lbs (95 kg) \n\n*LEGS* 5x5 Squats with 85% of 1RM \n\n*SHOULDERS* Smith-machine shoulder press 5x5\n\n**Wednesday**: Arms & Shoulders & Traps\n\n**Thursday**: Back\n\n**Friday**: Chest\n\n**Saturday**: Arms & Shoulders & Traps ( As they are lacking for me the most)\n\n**Sunday** : Legs\n\n**NOTE : I do a variety of exercises Wednesday to Sunday as I try to change it up every week. If there is anyone interested I will be more than happy to write an in-depth spreadsheet or something along those lines describing my routines. Generally I try to aim for at least 12 reps and 4 sets on every exercise.**\n\nAbout the nutrition : I'm currently sitting on 230-240 grams of protein / 80 grams of fats / 325 grams of carbs as I'm starting a three-month bulk. I'll be increasing carbs by 25 grams every 2-3 days until I reach 600-650 grams / day. My goal is to reach 245 lbs (110 kgs) until March with as little fat gains as possible after which I will start to cut slowly so I can save the most muscle mass I can until i reach 10-8% (optimistically thinking) BF.\n\n**If you guys have any questions at all or are in need of help in starting your transformation journey I will be more than happy to help anyone with what I can - either it be training or nutrition. If there are people who are interested I can write a lot about nutrition as well - which foods I avoid, how I get my metabolism to work the way I want to, etc.**\n\nA few more before - after pictures ( All of the after pics are of my current form ) :\nhttp://imgur.com/a/IKttf\n\n*Edit - formatting*\n\n**As a lot of people asked me for more info on workouts and nutrition, I'll keep adding to this post, starting with my training routines :**\n\n**Shoulders :**\n\n*Standing OHP w/ a BB\n\n*Seated OHP w/ a BB or DBs \n\n*Seated OHP on a smith-machine\n\n*Arnold press\n\n*Choose 1 of these. I found the standing OHP w/ BB to be the best option for me as it puts the most tension on my shoulders*\n\n*One-arm side laterals w/ DB\n\n*One-arm side laterals on cable (Personally I prefer this for side laterals)\n\n*Seated side lateral raise\n\n*Choose 1 of these.*\n\n*Front raise w/ a plate (While leaning on a wall)\n\n*Front raise on cable\n\n*Front raise w/ DBs\n\n*Front raise w/ a BB or an EZ-bar\n\n*Choose 1 of these*\n\n*Reverse flyes\n\n*DB rear delt row\n\n*Cable rope rear delt rows\n\n*BB rear delt row\n\n*Face pull\n\n*Choose 1 of these*\n\n*Car drivers\n\n*Upright rows w/ a BB\n\n*Upright rows on cable\n\n*Choose 1 of these*\n\n\nOn the days that I train shoulders (aside from the Push-motion day) I typically aim to do 5 excercises (1 of each section I listed ). If I feel like racking up more weight I typically go 5x8 on all exercises. If I feel I want to get in more reps, I decrease the load to something I\u2019d be comfortable with doing about 12-14 reps and I do 4 sets of each.\n\n\nOn alternating weeks, or if I\u2019m in a rush I do a circuit-type of superset - for example I do 1 set of OHP on the smith-machine after which I immediately do 1 set of one-arm side laterals on cable > 1 set of front raises > 1 set of face pulls > 1 set ot upright rows. I aim to do around 12 reps on each set. After a each superset I take 2.5-3 minutes of rest and I go at it again. I do 5 supersets in total. You will feel like your shoulders are going to spontaneously combust after this.\n\n**Arms :**\n\n\nA lot of variety here. Who doesn\u2019t love working out arms.\n \n**Biceps :**\n\nI always start with something really strenuous like :\n\n-EZ-bar curls with the right weight to really make me break a sweat, which I do the following way : 12 reps - rest 12 seconds, 10 reps - rest 10 seconds, 8 reps - rest 8 seconds, 6 reps - rest 6 seconds, 4 reps - rest 4 seconds, 2 reps - done. The weight remains the same through all of the reps. I love this exercise.\n\n\n-Hammer curls, which I do the following way - 1 rep with 1RM, after which I immediately move to the next DBs on the rack in decreasing order and I do 2 reps with them > repeat with the next DBs (while still decreasing their weight) and do 3 reps. Continiue to 12 reps without resting.\n\n\nAfter doing 1 of these exercises I do the same for triceps (I\u2019ll write \u2018em down in the triceps section). After I do 1 exercise for triceps, I continue my workout with supersets of biceps and triceps.\n\n*To Be Continued\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "5 year & going transformation - 23M", "post_ups": 1507, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5h76mi/5_year_going_transformation_23m/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:24.288007", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "jedrekk", "post_created_utc": 1327028531.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1327032131.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "ooat5", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 577, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1510, "post_selftext": "[This image](http://imgur.com/ERxmt).\n\nCross sections of the upper legs of a a triathlete in his 40s, a sedentary man in his 70s and a triathlete in his 70s. \n\n*update* Y'all do realize that this is an MRI, not a cut away.

Bulked up really hard last summer, beginning June 2015, simply because I wanted strength and didn't really care about gaining fat. Late August 2015 I was 185lbs from 165lbs and substantially increased all my lifts. Did this bulk very very dirty, just made sure I had 3k+ calories a day with enough protein, however never tracked my weight or calorie count. Through the semester I didn't watch what I ate at all and ended up retaining my strength while moderately going to the gym. My physique fell off, I still felt strong but just looked flat. Towards end of April 2016 I decided to cut down a little bit while retaining my strength throughout the summer. April-June I eased into my cut with just cutting back on alcohol and sweets while consciously making healthier decisions of what I ate. Beginning early July 2016 I tracked every gram of food that went into my body, as well as my weight each morning. I was eating very healthy, ground turkey, egg weights, veggies, fruits, tuna. No processed foods. The story unfolds today, with the last picture being taken just this Friday at work. My big lifts slowly increased, squat and over head press increased the most. For the most part as of today my strength has stagnated. \n\n**Stats:** \n\n21M, 5'8, 16.9% BF START. 12-13% BF END. Measured starting BF with an actual instrument. End BF is a conservative estimate. \n\n\n\n**Lifts:**\n\n* Bench - 190lbs 1x9\n\n* OVHP - 115lbs 1x8\n\n* Squat - 245lbs 1x8\n \n* Deadlift - 265lbs 1x8 (Just did 285 lbs 1x3) (See my RPT modified method below in comments, this DL stat was just me testing out if I could jump my rep range, obviously didn't)\n\n* Row - 140lbs 1x6\n\n* EDIT: Weighted Chins 35lbs 1x6\n\n\n**Routine:**\n\nFollowed a leangains approach. RPT lifting method, focusing on the 5 big compound lifts above. \n\nFasted 16 hours, 8 hour feeding window. Fast began around 8:00pm, ended at 12:00pm the following day\n\nBroke my fast with a lean lunch, usually beans, chicken, tuna and some veggies. Ate a small meal after work around 6pm, usually eggs, bowl of granola and/or a banana. Played around with the timing of my meals a lot over the course of this. Ended up enjoying splitting the calories evenly before and after the workout. Didn't need the energy pre workout but towards the end of my cut all I could think about was food while working out. \n\n* Monday: Bench, Squat, 2-4 accessory chest exercises (weighted dips, incline DB press, pushups, cable flys)\n\n* Wednesday: OVHP, Deadlift, 3-5 accessory shoulder exercises (lat raises, facepulls, upright rows, Arnold press)\n\n* Friday: Rows, Weighted Chin-ups, 3-5 accessory back exercises (lat pull downs, seated rows, pullups)\n\n* Saturday: Intense fasted cardio, 10g BCAA before exercise + 200mg caffeine pill. Usually ran 4-6 miles at a decent pace. \n\n* Sunday: Light intensity cardio ( 60 mins walking ) with occasional light arms day/traps. \n\n\n**Diet:**\n\n[Weight Loss Graph/Stats](http://i.imgur.com/Iq9bu3l.png)\n\n700cal/day deficit for 35 days. (Only recorded data I have, I was in a deficit for about 3 months though) \nAveraged 1.6 lbs loss/week\n\n* Calories  -1,722 cals/day (averaged over 35 days) TDEE was estimated before cut at around 2200 cals/day.

Start somewhere, don't get caught up in the best routine or exactly what your TDEE is, just freaking get out there and start doing it. Track your data and be disciplined. \n\n**Going Forward:**\n\nSchool will be starting in less than a week. It's gonna be back to pizza and beer soon. But I'm going to see how my course load is, and if I'll be able to keep up my gym/meal prep time. I'm either going to maintain or try to slow bulk until next Spring..but we'll see how this semester goes. \n\n\n\n**tldr:** Summer 2015 Bulked to 185lbs from 165lbs.

[Here is the before and after photo.](http://i.imgur.com/lHJC7mU.jpg).  There are a lot of one year transformations on here but it's amazing what you can do in two months with the right diet and training.  I'm 33, 5'10 and no longer rock the dirty 'stache.  Here's how I did it.  \n\nI started my diet with two and a half weeks of keto (under 20g of carbs) and moderate cardio and not really counting calories or protein intake.  I was probably eating about at around 600-700 cal deficit. Got really serious about the diet and training after three weeks by using MyFitnessPal daily.  Weekly calorie deficit has been roughly 3500-4000, about 500-600 daily.  Protein intake at 1g/lb of body weight, 100-150 grams of carbs from grains, beans, and fruits.  The rest of my calories are from healthy fats like avacado, olive oil and animal fats.  It's loosely paleo, but I still eat oats, beans, and rice.  Breakfast is usually a protein shake and a banana, lunch is chicken/pork/beef/fish with a lot of veggies, and a dinner is similar but in a stew.    \n\nMy real workouts really started about two and a half weeks in.  Joined a kickboxing gym and started training four days a week.  Classes are 90 minutes with about 20 minutes of stretching, 40 minutes of HIIT conditioning, and 30 minutes of technique.  Did this for about two weeks and then started adding on weight training the last three weeks.  I do a modified hypertrophy workout of chest/tri, back/bi, legs/abs.  There is no set routine since I travel a lot for work and just use whatever gym is available at the hotel.  I just try to lift as heavy as possible to get 10-12 reps, and if I can't make it, I go a lower weight and finish the set.  Weight training is roughly an hour and I try to burn out all whatever I'm working by the end.  I honestly don't know what my lifts are.     \n\nThe way I approached it was diet first, then training.  I still have a cheat day once a week where I eat/drink roughly 2500 calories, but I'm usually eating 1900 calories daily.  I plan on shredding for another two weeks and then starting lean gains or a recomp to add more muscle mass.

Here\u2019s my fourth update. I\u2019m a 37-year-old, 5'11\", 232lb dude. I don't compete in any strength sports. I started lifting in May 2016. I hit my 1st year\u2019s goals in May 2017 and I established new goals at that time for May 2018. My goals were to hit these numbers for my 37th birthday (this month): 585 squat, 455 bench, 605 dead, 275 OHP. I ended up coming in a bit short of those for squat and OHP, but I got them for dead and bench:\n\n* [565 Squat](https://vimeo.com/271924877)\n* [465 Bench](https://vimeo.com/272030646)\n* [635 Deadlift](https://vimeo.com/271927079)\n* [265 OHP](https://vimeo.com/258440774)\n\n###PROGRESS\n\nProgress has been slowing down a lot. Here\u2019s a summary of my lifts/updates, so far:\n\n* [PR Graph](https://i.imgur.com/tCf2xmS.png)\n* Starting - No idea about 1RMs. I just started with 10x10 at 135 for SBD. \n* 7 months \u2013 PPL \u2013 1125 total - 405/315/405/205 \u2013 215 BW - [Post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5mdku9/silly_newbie_trying_to_get_to_a_1225_total/)\n* 1 year \u2013 nSuns 531LP \u2013 1310 total - 425/385/500/225 \u2013 225 BW - [Post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/67xh8q/finally_hit_my_goal_after_11_months_1300_total/)\n* 1.5 years \u2013 nSuns 531LP \u2013 1515 total \u2013 525/425/565/255 \u2013 230 BW - [Post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/76q20i/murder_dungeon_gym_presents_15_year_update_1515/)\n* 2 years \u2013 AtS and some BS \u2013 1665 total \u2013 565/465/635/265 \u2013 232 BW\n\n###TRAINING\n\nI had been running a modification of AtS ([Average to Savage](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/training-toolkit/) from /u/gnuckols) and then it slowly morphed into something unrecognizable. It\u2019s essentially and upper/lower split with a wave periodization running from 12s, 8s, 5s, and 2s/3s. It\u2019s pretty straightforward. Here are some other aspects:\n\n* No scheduled rest days. I just run 5 basic days, continuously. \n* No formal deloads (although I will go pretty light on the 12s weeks and then repeat with heavier weight if I want). \n* Lift all day. I lift and work at home, so I\u2019ll start around 6am and usually finish up by 8pm. \n* Focus on volume. I\u2019m a volume whore. I pay a lot of attention to fatigue and try to stay fairly close to my recovery limit. \n* I sleep 9-10 hours/night.\n* Back work every day.\n* Not getting caught up in details \u2013 I think 90% of the discussions online are about the last 10% that matters. To me, the most important part of training is simply putting in a lot of work every week.\n* Doing all the rows\n\n###WHAT\u2019S CHANGED?\n\nFor a long time I fell into a the trap of, \"if some volume/frequency/specificity is good, more must always be better!\". Well, it's kind of stopped working that way. Especially for deads. Lowering the frequency for conventional, off-the-floor deads and doing other things has helped a ton. RDLS, frame deadlift, ROM progression, TnG reps for most things, sumo, etc. They have all helped. Not deadlifting has helped my deadlift a lot. :)\n\n###WHAT\u2019S NEXT?\n\nI\u2019m going to stop chasing SBDO numbers for a while. I haven\u2019t sorted it all out yet, but my next goals will involve conditioning, grip, lowering body fat, cardio. I'll probably come back to chasing lifts in a year or so. :)\n\n\nWhy? I've bulked continuously for 2 years. I get heartburn all the time. I make weird noises when I try to get up off the floor. I can barely touch my shoulder with my finger. I'm just less happy weighing this much. I need to reset and do some base-building. A big part of the base-building will be conditioning. I think I have pretty good work-capacity. That is a very different thing that conditioning. I can get a ton done in a day and recover well, but I can't get shit done in 20 mins. :) I use to think, \"my goals are all singles for max weight... why would I need conditioning?\". That was dumb. Conditioning and being in generally good shape might not be super important for performing that single rep. But, to get to that point there's 10,000 other reps that need to be performed. :)\n\nAnyway, now I'm just rambling. I want to get in better shape, build some more general strength (less specialized), and lose some body fat. Then I'll make a run at a 500lb bench. :)\n\nCheers!\n\nEdit - Pics for those that have requested. I've never really had any physique goals. I have some pics from the Weakpoint Wednesdays on Weightroom. That's the best I can do. \n\n* [Chest](https://i.imgur.com/QBkWG0x.jpg)\n* [Back](https://i.imgur.com/ffluKN6.png)\n* [Traps](https://i.imgur.com/yu52Tcs.png)\n\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "2 Year Update - 565 Squat, 465 Bench, 635 Dead, 265 OHP", "post_ups": 1499, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8mv3xa/2_year_update_565_squat_465_bench_635_dead_265_ohp/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:24.288007", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "EternalOptimist829", "post_created_utc": 1454410871.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1454486154.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "43tr7b", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 876, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1501, "post_selftext": "I don't get it cause my friends say they feel great after working out and like they have tons of energy but I feel completely beaten down like I have nothing left after I work out.

Compound exercises count as well, it doesn't have to be isolation\n\n- Training only once a week is inferior to twice a week. Schoenfeld doesn't yet know if training more frequently than twice a week is superior\n\n- No rep ranges seems to be superior for gains\n\n- No repetition duration seems to be superior for gains (but durations longer than 10s are bad)\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n##Longer inter-set rest periods enhance muscle strength and hypertrophy in resistance-trained men [(Schoenfeld et al., 2015)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284711582_Longer_inter-set_rest_periods_enhance_muscle_strength_and_hypertrophy_in_resistance-trained_men)\n\n> Maximal strength was significantly greater for both 1RM squat and bench press for [long rests of 3 minutes] compared to [short rests of 1 minute]. Muscle thickness was significantly greater for LONG compared to SHORT in the anterior thigh and a trend for greater increases was noted in the triceps brachii,(p = 0.06) as well. Both groups saw significant increases in local upper body muscle endurance with no significant differences noted between groups. The present study provides evidence that longer rest periods promote greater increases in muscle strength and hypertrophy in young resistance-trained men.\n\n##Dose-response relationship between weekly resistance training volume and increases in muscle mass: A systematic review and meta-analysis [(Schoenfeld et al., 2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305455324_Dose-response_relationship_between_weekly_resistance_training_volume_and_increases_in_muscle_mass_A_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis)\n\n> ###Abstract\n\n> The purpose of this paper was to systematically review the current literature and elucidate the effects of total weekly resistance training (RT) volume on changes in measures of muscle mass via meta-regression. The final analysis comprised 34 treatment groups from 15 studies. Outcomes for weekly sets as a continuous variable showed a significant effect of volume on changes in muscle size (P = 0.002). **Each additional set was associated with an increase in effect size (ES) of 0.023 corresponding to an increase in the percentage gain by 0.37%**. Outcomes for weekly sets categorised as lower or higher within each study showed a significant effect of volume on changes in muscle size (P = 0.03); the ES difference between higher and lower volumes was 0.241, which equated to a percentage gain difference of 3.9%. Outcomes for weekly sets as a three-level categorical variable (<5, 5\u20139 and 10+ per muscle) showed a trend for an effect of weekly sets (P = 0.074). The findings indicate a graded dose-response relationship whereby increases in RT volume produce greater gains in muscle hypertrophy.\n\n> ###Practical applications\n\n> The current body of evidence indicates a graded dose- response relationship between RT volume and muscle growth. **Clearly, substantial hypertrophic gains can be made using low- volume protocols ( \u2264 4 weekly sets per muscle group). Such an approach therefore represents a viable muscle-building option for those who are pressed for time** or those to which the conservation of energy is an ongoing concern (i.e., frail elderly). However, the present analysis shows that HV proto- cols produce significantly greater increases in muscle growth than LV. **Based on our findings, it would appear that performance of at least 10 weekly sets per muscle group is necessary to maximise increases in muscle mass**. **Although there is certainly a threshold for volume beyond which hypertrophic adaptations plateau and perhaps even regress due to overtraining**, current research is insufficient to determine the upper limits of this dose-response relationship. It is clear that **the optimal RT dose will ultimately vary between individuals, and these differences may have a genetic component**. For example, research shows that the variances in the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) genotype affects the strength-related response to single- versus multiple-set rou- tines (Colakoglu et al., 2005 ). Although the ACE gene does not appear  to  mediate  the  hypertrophic  response  to  RT (Charbonneau et al., 2008 ), it remains possible that other genes may well influence volume-related muscular gains. Consistent with an evidence-based approach, **practitioners should carefully monitor client progression and adjust training dosages based on the individual \u2019 s response**.\n\n\n##Effects of Resistance Training Frequency on Measures of Muscle Hypertrophy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis [(Schoenfeld et al., 2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301578131_Effects_of_Resistance_Training_Frequency_on_Measures_of_Muscle_Hypertrophy_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis)\n\n> When comparing studies that investigated training muscle groups between 1 to 3 days per week on a volume-equated basis, the current body of evidence indicates that frequencies of training twice a week promote superior hypertrophic outcomes to once a week. It can therefore be inferred that the major muscle groups should be trained at least twice a week to maximize muscle growth; whether training a muscle group three times per week is superior to a twice-per-week protocol remains to be determined.\n\n##Effects of Varied Versus Constant Loading Zones on Muscular Adaptations In Well-Trained Men [(Schoenfeld et al., 2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292437154_Effects_of_Varied_Versus_Constant_Loading_Zones_on_Muscular_Adaptations_In_Well-Trained_Men)\n\n> Training with a variety of repetition ranges has been theorized to provide an optimal hypertrophic stimulus to both type I and II  fibers, and  possibly  augment  the  hypertrophic  response  as compared to training in fixed repetition ranges in isolation [26] The present results suggest that comparable hypertrophic, strength, and endurance adaptations occur when a varied training protocol is compared against a fixed loading program at 8\u201312 RM; however, trends suggest that improved muscular endurance may occur in protocols that employ high repetition ranges.\n\n## Effect of Repetition Duration During Resistance Training on Muscle Hypertrophy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis [(Schoenfeld et al., 2015)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271533635_Effect_of_Repetition_Duration_During_Resistance_Training_on_Muscle_Hypertrophy_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis)\n\n> Results indicate that hypertrophic outcomes are similar when training with repetition durations ranging from 0.5 to 8 s. From a practical standpoint it would seem that a fairly wide range of repetition durations can be employed if the primary goal is to maximize muscle growth. Findings suggest that training at volitionally very slow durations (>10s per repetition) is inferior from a hypertrophy standpoint, although a lack of controlled studies on the topic makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Evidence-based recommendations for rest periods, volume, frequency, repetition number and duration (collection of studies, reviews, and meta-analyses from Schoenfeld)", "post_ups": 1493, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4v625o/evidencebased_recommendations_for_rest_periods/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:24.288007", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "IngiPall", "post_created_utc": 1417800754.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1424973413.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2odp10", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 254, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1500, "post_selftext": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djIdZC6Fitk \n\nHappy holidays everyone.\n\nEdit: Here are his other two songs if you're interested:\n\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD79miUXZXc&list=UU-SIsj-anbv_CzRxbb5K6IQ - Pump\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZvpDCP_BZ4&list=UU-SIsj-anbv_CzRxbb5K6IQ - Louder", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Icelandic bodybuilder parodies 'Last Christmas'.

Not only will you feel full for longer, and you will gain less fat.\n\nBut isn't all of this related to the glycemic index? So it's not actually sugar, but foods with a high glycemic index? \n\nShouldn't foods like white rice and potatoes also be a problem then? \n\nWhy is it always the sugar getting all the blame?

It was a 2 day split set up by my high school for the weight training class. After that I took a year and a half off while I was putting my life together out of high school restarted lifting with Starting Strength in October 2013. I had a back injury in December which kept me from squatting and deads for ~2 months, I did smolov jr. for bench during this time. Restarted SS again once my back was better and got my lifts back to where they were, then started my own routine around April.\n\nBench: 65 (initial Fall 2011) -> 110 (Spring 2012 ) -> 100 (November 2013) -> 135 (current)\n\nDL: Unknown (initial Fall 2011) -> unknown (Spring 2012 ) -> 250 (November 2013) -> 315 (current)\n\nSquat: 135 (initial Fall 2011) -> 235 with questionable depth (Spring 2012 ) -> 155 (October 2013) -> 235 below parallel (current)\n\n* Diet and weight- IIFYM. mainly just trying to eat as much as I can though, as I have trouble eating enough. Between November 2013 to April 2014 I gained around 9 lbs (117 to 126). May I lost 5 lbs (121 lbs) though due to Finals week and getting sick, I also had to take almost 2 weeks off working out then. When I came back 2 weeks ago my working sets had all gone down 15-20 lbs. As of now my weight is still around 121 lbs and I am struggling to eat enough for my activity level, although my squat and bench have gone back up to being only 5 lbs less than what they were, and my deadlift has exceeded what it was.\n* Current routine- A bit scattered  at the moment, things havent been normal since finals. Generally I do chest 2x a week, legs 2x a week, and back 2x a week. I always do legs and chest on separate days and i usually pair back with legs, but not always. \n\n    Chest day 1: flat bench 3x5, incline 3x5, weighted dips 3x5\n\n    Chest day 2: flat bench 3x8, incline 3x8, weighted dips 3x8\n\n    Legs days: Squat 3x5, Bulgarian split squat 3x5\n\n    Back days: Choose 1 or 2 of the three. Weighted pull-ups starting with max weight I can do for 5 and dropping weight after that throughout the set till I reach failure at body weight, bent over rows 3x5, deadlift 1x5 or 2x5\n\n\n**EDIT:** Wow this is getting big! For the people asking is I will compete, I honestly wasnt planning on doing much more than the unofficial competition at my University, though after finding out my lift is large enough to break a mother fucking record that has changed my mind a bit! If I want to break this record though I will need to do so fast, as my birthday is in September and I have no qualifiers yet even under my belt to even compete in national events. The other thing is my back injury in December was from pulling my back trying to touch my toes, and not lifting related :/\n\n\n**EDIT 2:** Guys please remember this day I pulled fucking 45 more pounds than I have EVER pulled before. This is a HUGE PR and my form will obviously not be prefect. Form break down happens at a true 1rm.\n\n\n**EDIT 3:** Made it to the front page you guys!!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n**UPDATE:** Alright, I registered with USPA and have signed up to do a Raw full-lift meet in Maryland on July 12, 2014.

I'm a female, 26, 4'11, 130lbs, runner, climber, soccer player, and occasional hiker. I just can't get my weight down. I used to fluctuate between 120-125 (which I didn't love) but for the last two years, I've been fluctuating between 125-130 and usually I'm closer to 130.\n\nI do have a sugar problem that I'm actively trying to control but I have a really hard time eating at a deficit because I'm just so freaking hungry if I try to keep it to 1200 calories/day. I usually end up eating somewhere between 1400-1600 and I either gain or maintain. The only time I lose any weight, and still not to my desired range, is when I exercise more - which I simply can't do all the time as I've already got a fairly steady gym 3 days/week schedule (2-3 hours/session). My current schedule is the max I can fit in with working full time/grad school part time.\n\nI'm healthy and relatively muscular, I'm probably 25% body fat, definitely not overweight despite BMI saying I'm borderline obese. My BMR is probably around 1300.\n\nI've been wanting to go down to 115-120lbs for a very long time so I can climb harder but I've been unable to eat at a deficit for any decent period of time.\n\nBreakfast is usually fiber one toast with butter or plain greek yogurt and fruit, lunch is some kind of salad with minimal dressing, I snack on fruit, and dinner is either salad or meat with veggies. I try not to keep sugary things (my one indulgence is cool whip and frozen fruit) at home but if someone brings cookies to work, I'm gonna eat some.\n\nShort people - how do you do it? Any meal suggestions?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone for taking the time to provide me with your advice and insight. I definitely have some homework to do! Hopefully the next time I post, it will be a progress update on how I actually followed through on the advice people gave and am seeing results :p\n\nEdit 2: My \"gym\" sessions are climbing sessions at the rock gym. I'm not lifting weights for 9 hours/week, just lifting my body. I don't spend 2-3 hours straight climbing, I take turns belaying my partner so there are rests built in. If it's relevant to anyone on here - I lead 5.10-5.11-, TR 5.10-5.12-, and boulder v4-v7. I also do treadwall sessions once a week at maximum incline for 10 minutes. I usually run an average of 9 miles/week outdoors (sometimes much more, sometimes a bit less) but if the weather sucks, then some of my time in the gym is spent running. I play soccer 1X/week.\n\nEdit 3: For all the people confused about how I believe I'm not overweight despite my BMI being in the overweight/obese range - I can post photos later but my measurements are chest: 28, waist: 26, hips: 37. I wear size 0-2 in dresses and size 2 in pants. Muscle weighs more then fat, I'm very muscular. I also have some fat I'd like to get rid of, which is why I posted in the first place. I have no way of measuring body fat, I'm just estimating I'm at around 25%. I look better at 130 now then I did 6 months ago at 130. Weight is not my primary concern, bf% is but since I'm unable measure bf%  weight is all I have to go off of.  I need to change what/how I eat. Most of y'all have been immensely helpful in providing suggestions how to change what/how I eat so once again - thanks!\n\nEdit 4: Here are some photos so y'all can see that although I weigh a lot for someone so short, I am not overweight. It is possible for people to have high BMIs and not be overweight. [https://imgur.com/a/T0HBY2O](https://imgur.com/a/T0HBY2O) I'm sure y'all can also see from these photos why I came here asking for tips on how to eat at a deficit.

I'm far from done yet, but I have come a long way.\n\n[2.5 year progress](http://www.jasonhfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/April-2014-progress-jhf-2.jpg)\n\n\nStats:\n\nHeight: 6'4\n\nStarting Weight: 170lbs\n\nCurrent Weight: 212 lbs\n\n\n\nBulking calories 4000 +-\n\nCutting Calories 3200 +-\n\n\n\n\nI am not sure of my one rep maxes.

They are a big muscle and can take a lot of abuse. 2. They are stubborn to grow. 3. Training bigger muscle groups like legs actually releases more hormones that help rebuild the muscles throughout my body. 4. Squatting is fun\n\n[Here is a sample of my training schedule](http://www.jasonhfitness.com/?page_id=40)\n\nI officially started my training journey 2.5 years ago. The kick off was joining Reddit's second BTFC \"Body Transformation Challenge\" at the end of August, 2011. I decided if I can stick with it for 3 months maybe I have a chance. At the end of the three month challenge I came in second place. It turns out if you actually apply what you learn you see results!\n\nOver the last couple years I have continued to learn and improve my physique. I found that I absolutely love helping people. So much so I started a blog to help address some of the many common questions I see and inspire others. Check it out here at:\n\nwww.jasonhfitness.com \n\nThere is so much bullshit out there that getting in great shape seems over complicated (it was for me in the beginning). I've applied my own knowledge and learned \"the truth\" so to speak. It's simple so don't let anyone fool you: Eat right and train hard. Be consistent and never look for shortcuts. Put in the work and be honest with yourself. Real progress takes months. Embrace the grind and love the hard work. It doesn't matter so much what program you follow, especially as a beginner. It matters that you actually FOLLOW THROUGH and train consistently.\n\nI recommend anyone interested in working out to scour youtube, google workout questions and read books on fitness and nutrition. Become hungry for information. That is what I've done for over 6 years now and continue to do daily. It doesn't have to be complicated, but there is always more to learn.\n\nIf you are interested I upload my [personal workouts](http://www.jasonhfitness.com/) each week to my blog for subscribers. My hope is to demonstrate what has been very successful for me so that you maximize your time making progress and spend less time spinning your wheels. By design my workouts include explanations and are a great place to learn about training and ultimately developing your own training style. /end sales pitch. A good free place to start is google or websites like simplyshredded. There are some great programs there and motivation. \n\nIt is my dream to start making a difference and show that vegetarians can pack on muscle too. Any support would be greatly appreciated!\n\nFeel free to AMA about diet, training or anything else. \n\nYou can also follow me on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/jasonhfitness) which is a great place to ask questions as well. \n\n\n\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU FOR ALL THE GREAT QUESTIONS! \n\nFor all the great support I want to give away a free month to my workout planner.

My whole family was tall (Swedish/Northern European ancestry) and my dad is 6\u20193\u201d, my brother is 6\u20193\u201d and my uncle is 6\u20198\u201d. I graduated high school at 5\u201910\u201d and thought I didn\u2019t get the height gene. When I was 19 I grew 6 inches in a year, which resulted in a lot of back problems. By the time I grew to my peak height I was 6\u20195\u201d and a whopping 166 pounds at 20 years old. My doctor told me that I needed to strengthen my back in order to accommodate my newfound height. \nI did P90x and P90x2 in 2007 and 2008 which I actually really enjoyed at the time. They showed me the dedication it takes to workout everyday and it was simple enough.\nBy the end of 2008 I was about 182 pounds and had a nice 6 pack which surprised all my friends from high school.    \nFor the next 7 years I messed around in the gym but not very seriously. The true definition of \u201cfuckarounditis\u201d but I was happy enough with my physique not to make any serious changes. I just thought I was tall and skinny with a \u201csmall frame.\u201d\n\nIn 2016 I quit my job and joined the Peace Corps to teach English in Ukraine. During our training months someone told a story about how they were finishing up their service (27 months) and all of the skills they learned in their downtime; learned to play guitar from scratch, learned to embroider etc. For me, I knew I wanted to reinvent my body. I was tired of being the \u201ctall guy\u201d and wanted to be the \u201cbig guy.\u201d\n\nSo I went r/fitness and read the wiki , then searched for posts about tall people. I remember one poster noting they were short and would do anything to be tall like me and that I have the potential to be a \u201cmonster.\u201d Then I saw this photo with Hafthors transformation https://imgur.com/a/rXeNz and I knew I was just making excuses for my \u201cbody type\u201d. (Yes I know he\u2019s on PEDs)  \n\n**Diet** When I arrived in Ukraine I weighed a skinny fat 207lbs. 3 Months into training and I was down to 188lbs. This was due to the fact that I lived with a Ukrainian grandma who ate like a bird, so therefore so did I. Everything that follows is from June 2016 to current.    Food wise I eat just about anything I can get my hands on. Food is very seasonal here in Ukraine so we have very distinct seasons that make it difficult to plan meals. \n\nAt 188lbs my TDEE I calculated was 3100cal/day accounting for daily lifting. I am also on my feet all day teaching. So at that time I shot for 3600/day.\nMy daily meal routine would be something like this (June 2016 to December 2016)     \n\n* Breakfast: 5 Eggs Scrambled, 2 cups oatmeal with a full apple and cinnamon.    \n\n* AM snack: Donut and cappuccino    \n\n* Lunch: Breaded fried chicken breast, mashed potatoes, carrot salad, and bread.    \n\n* PM snack: Yogurt and salted peanuts\n\n* Dinner: Cabbage salad, potatoes of some kind, liver or chicken (depended on what my host family was cooking) \n\nI was making good progress with this, and 6 \nmonths my progress went like this. \n   \nDATE | GOAL WEIGHT | ACTUAL WEIGHT\n:--|:--:|--:\n06/10 | 199 | 201\n07/10 | 203 | 205\n08/09 | 207 | 207\n09/09 | 211 | 212\n10/10 | 215 | 215\n11/14 | 229 | 218\n12/12 | 223 | 223    \n\nIn December 2016 I moved out and finally had control over my diet. I bought a food scale, a blender, and some creatine powder (protein powder is too expensive for me here).    \n\nMy usual diet from December 2016 to current\n\n* Breakfast \u2013 4 eggs scrambled, big breakfast shake (cottage cheese, milk, glob of peanut butter, cup of blended oats, a full banana, cinnamon for taste, olive oil)    \n\n* Lunch: Breaded fried chicken breast, mashed potatoes, carrot salad, and bread (bigger portion than before)\n\n* Post-workout snack: Shake (same as before minus the oats)\n\n* Dinner: Pizza from scratch with lots of chicken or turkey breast, or pasta with salad and a big grilled chicken breast.\n\n* Dessert: Ice cream\n\nFrom December 2016 to Current here were my monthly weigh-ins:\n\nDATE | GOAL WEIGHT | ACTUAL WEIGHT\n:--|:--:|--:\n01/09 | 227 | 227\n02/06 | 231 | 229\n03/06 | 235 | 231\n04/03 | 239 | 234\n05/01 | 243 | 237\n06/03 | 247 | 238\n07/04 | 251 | 236\n08/03 | 255 | 232\n09/03 | 259 | 236\n10/03 | 263 | 240!\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that I actually lost some weight this summer. I was on vacation for about 2 months and was not able to gym or eat as much as I would have liked. It was worth it though.\n\n**Lifting Routine**\nPhase 1: For the first 5 months I ran SL5x5. I started with the bar as recommended and made it up to these lifts (all for 3 reps)\n\nPhase 2: After the great advice from u/mystic_moos3 and u/LukeatanPeninsula I switched to the 6 day Reddit PPL. They correctly noted that SL5x5 just didn\u2019t have enough volume in general, especially for our big frames.\n\nOver that year I ended up modifying the PPL quite a bit. Too much actually. My body was exhausted, my wife hated me because my sex drive fell off a cliff, and I wasn\u2019t stretching enough.\n\nPhase 3: For the last 2 months I have been running NSUNS 5 day. I have added my own accessories of course. \nCurrent lifts (set of 3)\n\nLifts | Squat | Bench | Dead | OHP\n- | - |  - | - | -\n5x5 | 175 | 145 | 215 | 110\nPPL | 260 | 215 | 345 | 145\nNSUNS | 290 | 255 | 405 | 175\n\n**Whats next**: Well, its winter in Ukraine, so there\u2019s not much else to do but bulk some more. The plan is to bulk until 250 by March, then maybe go on a 10lb cut before I head back home to the states in May.\n\n**Lessons Learned**:\n\n+ When you stop gaining, recalculate TDEE and weigh your food again for the next week.\n\n+ Stop worrying about losing your 6 pack, it will hold you back!\n\n+ Stop blaming your lack of progress on your \u201cbody type.\u201d I did this until I was 28 and now I\u2019m almost 30 and have wasted my 20\u2019s making excuses\n\n+ You don\u2019t need supplements at all, but if I could afford it I would definitely get some protein powder to make some better shakes\n\n+ Many of the people I used to look up to on social media were on the sauce/juice/gear, which skewed my expectations for what is achievable naturally.\n\n+ Take progress pics! Even when you are not satisfied with your current physique. Your future self will thank you.\n\n**Interesting drawbacks of more mass**:\n\n* I can't sleep on my side anymore or I wake up with a lot of shoulder pain on that side.\n\n* I'm HOT all the time. Even in the winter I'm sweating (could be due to hair/beard too)\n\n**TLDR**: Was skinny but athletic, decided to get bigger. Now my goal is to get into the WALL OF GAINS :)\n\nIMGUR ALBUM \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/JHy4Z\n\nMy Xpost from r/beards\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/RvORC\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "My 16 Months Peace Corps Progress (188 to 240) M29", "post_ups": 1486, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/76wxtm/my_16_months_peace_corps_progress_188_to_240_m29/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:24.288007", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "Gooberchev", "post_created_utc": 1497402312.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1509317945.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "6h48oi", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 252, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1487, "post_selftext": "**I UPDATED THIS POST ON 9/10**\n\nI posted here a couple months ago with the results I achieved using moderate HIIT workouts in combination with lifting.

I am more than happy to answer any questions. I think this is the best routine I have made for myself yet and I am very happy with the results. \n\n\nI started lifting after a long break around 3/1/2017 - https://imgur.com/ktRr4Jr this photo was taken on 4/13.\n\n\nI took a 4 week break from 6/16 to 7/10 while I traveled in Thailand. During that time I ate very little protein and lost muscle and gained fat. \n\n\n**Before Leaving for Thailand:** https://imgur.com/Kg59LLO\n\n\n**After Returning:** https://imgur.com/6lEm99R\n\n\n\nSince returning I have changed up my routine a bit and my diet a lot. \n\n\n**Lifting Routine:** I have a very simple workout routine. 3 days on and then one day off and then 3 days on again. My main 3 days consist of the same 3-4 core workouts and then I add in about 4 other accessory lifts. I will list out my main lifts. \n\n\nDay 1 (Back): Deadlift, rows, pullups and supermans, bicep curls\n\nDay 2 (Chest): Bench (incline and regular), pec-deck machine, skull crushers and overhead press\n\nDay 3 (Legs): Squat, front squat leg press, lunges, calf raises\n\nOff day: Rest\n\n\n**NOTE:** I switch up the rep and set number group of 3 days. This week I have been doing pyramid sets (10 reps at 50%, 8 reps at 60%, 6 reps at 70%... up to 90% and then back down). Next week I will do 5 sets of 5 and the next I will do higher volume like 3x12. \n\n\n**HIIT:** \nThis is something I am doing completely different from before leaving for Thailand. I am now doing **Plyometric Insanity** 3 times a week at minimum. The day of week I do the plyo circuit changes depending on my workout schedule. I never do the circuit on the same day as leg day. I have found this has done wonders in losing fat. I also cycle to and from class and the gym but I do not push myself super hard while cycling. \n\n\n**Meals:** I eat heavier than I used to now that I am doing insanity. I find that my previous diet leaves me starving. \n\n*Breakfast:*\n\n1 large bowl of cereal. Usually some type of calorie dense cereal and a protein shake. This next week I will be shifting to protein shake and soylent. \n\n\n*Lunch:*\n\n\n\n\nPeanut butter & Honey sandwich\n\nString cheese or something snacky\n\nApple\n\n\n*Dinner:*\n\nI have been eating a very basic dinner for the past month and I love it. \n\n4 eggs\n\n1 cup of rice (uncooked)\n\n1 tbsp soy sauce\n\n1 tbsp sesame oil\n\n1.5 cups of Kimchi\n\n\n*Snacks:* I try not to snack at all. If anything, I will drink a protein shake to fill me up\n\n\n**Lifestyle:** I am a graduate student so I am at school for 7-9 hours a day. Other than that I lift, do insanity, and sleep. I make sure to always get 8 hours of sleep at night. \n\n\n**Imgur Album w/ after pictures:** https://imgur.com/a/7T7TU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Bench:** 245 lbs (205 @ 6/7)\n\n\n**Deadlift:** 455 lbs (425 @ 6/7)\n\n\n**Squat:** 330 lbs (315 @ 6/7)\n", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "Managed to pull off a *clean* bulk. 15 lbs gained in 3.5 months doing HIIT and heavy lifting.

I would occasionally go and mess around in the gym. Would usually stick to the treadmill or lift with very bad form as I had no idea how to do anything. \n\n[Here ](https://imgur.com/gallery/CZUBx0x) is a before and after pic. First pic is from May 1st, the other two are from November 30th. \n\nI currently have no idea where my 1rm is nor do I really care right now. But here are some numbers last time I checked in late August/early September, just before I got injured: \n\n1RM:\n********************\nBack squat: 185lbs\nFront squat: 165lbs\nDeadlift: 245lbs\nBench: 115lbs\n\nTraining \n********************\nStarted out with 3h a week of CrossFit (1 hour x 3 days a week) and slowly increased that to 2.5-3h x 5 days a week in August. At this point I had just started candito 6 week strength training program. Would do 1h at lunch and the rest after work. \n\nFor those of you that are curious, the classes are usually divided into 3 parts. Warmup, main lift/strength training, and then the workout of the day or \u201cthe WOD\u201d. \n\nUnfortunately due to over exercising, not getting enough sleep, not eating well, and stress from work, I inevitably injured my back. Apparently your body needs rest. Lol. So, I ended up taking all of September and some of October off to rest and recover. \n\nWhen I began training again in October, almost all of my workouts were modified in one way or another to accommodate for my injury. Which was fine, at least I was back at the gym, being responsible about the workouts, and seeing my physiotherapist to make sure everything was working the way it was supposed to. \n\nI\u2019m just starting candito again and finally almost back to where I was in August although I\u2019m still super vary of lifts such as snatching, overhead squats, and back squats. \n\nDiet\n********************\nPretty much just eating whenever I\u2019m hungry. I think I\u2019ve been eating around 2-2.5k calories a day in the past month or so. :) \n\nSupplements\n********************\nI never really took anything until ~2weeks ago. Right now I take is fish oil in the am, 2 scoops of beta alanine in my water bottle to drink through out the day, 1 scoop of pwo just before the gym and 1 scoop of creatine afterwards with my dinner. \n\nThoughts on crossfit \n********************\nHonestly? It\u2019s been great. I have suffered (and still am in a way) from depression in the past. A year ago today, there was no way I could\u2019ve motivated or pushed myself  hard enough to walk into a gym and workout. I would make up every excuse in the book to just not do anything. I was just in a very dark place. School wasn\u2019t going well, I had no idea if I liked my major, most nights I\u2019d be crying myself to sleep, I\u2019d binge eat a lot more than I do right now and all that other fun stuff. \n\nAfter the past 7 months, my life finally has routine and some order to it. I no longer need to be motivated/inspired to gym, work, study, and perform other daily tasks anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s all a matter of discipline for me now. It takes me a week or two to do it but I can now easily focus on developing a new habit but just disciplining myself to do it for a short while.\n\nI couldn\u2019t be happier with my improvement if I tried. As corny as it sounds, I have finally started to believe in myself enough to know that I\u2019m in complete power of achieving what I want if I work hard and discipline myself through it.\n\nI owe this all to those brutal \u201cwods\u201d, \u201cemoms\u201d and \u201camraps\u201d that everyone always makes fun of on social media. :)\n\nGoals\n********************\nI would like to do another month of CrossFit and then start powerlifting in January for 8-12 months before switching back to CrossFit. I\u2019m hoping that if I cycle between the two I will be able to progress a lot faster and become a lot stronger. \n\nLong term goal would be to compete in either one by the time I\u2019m 25-26.\n\nShort term goal would be to get my eating habits under control. I tend to binge eat a lot and it\u2019d be nice to not do that. \n\nThanks for reading! \n\nTl;dr: lifting makes me happy :)", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "21/F/5'4\" SW: 130lbs CW:135lbs -7 months- turns out CrossFit does get you some gains", "post_ups": 1482, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/a2pro5/21f54_sw_130lbs_cw135lbs_7_months_turns_out/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:24.288007", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "N8dogg86", "post_created_utc": 1450022185.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": false, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "3wnpvt", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 1863, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1488, "post_selftext": "For me it's definitely the rows.

There's a whole lot of information, so you may disagree with some of it, but that's okay. I'll definitely be experimenting with some of the ideas he shared.\n\n\nHe goes over a lot of topics, but here's what stood out to me:\n\n1. It's easier to gain muscle when you're lean.\n\n2. Don't be too restrictive in your diet - it won't work. Allow yourself some freedoms so you can stick to it.\n\n3. Have a healthy relationship with food - don't rush your goals at this expense. He goes as far to say that, \"If you don't have the healthiest relationship with food, it's imperative to work on that BEFORE you start a diet.\"\n4. Muscles have different 'MRV's, or Maximum Recoverable Volume. This is the recommended number of sets you should do for each muscle each week. Knowing how they vary can help you plan your training. For example, in the article, Dr. Israetel says side delts can handle around 25 working sets per week. (I don't do nearly that much, do you?)\n5.  He recommends starting with the Minimum Effective Dose (MED) for growth, progressing up to the MRV, then once progression is no longer sustainable without excessive fatigue, deloading. \n6. The minimum hypertrophy threshold is around 60% of your 1RM. Increasing too far above this level of intensity will cause a disproportionate amount of fatigue (bad, if your only goal is muscle).\n7. Some lifts have limiting factors that need to be brought up for them to improve, such as the Deadlift. Other lifts may have limiting factors, but do not require you to specialize on a specific weak muscle (Bench Press).\n8. Varying your training is important for muscle growth, as your body gets used to the stimulus it's given. This isn't on the scale of weeks, but rather several months.\n9. You cannot train all of your muscles to their MRV at once due to the limitations of your body's overall recovery. He recommends focusing on several muscle groups at once while maintaining others to deal with this.\n10. Going to failure will produce slightly more stimulus, but MUCH more fatigue. Use failure sparingly.\n11. As you progress, you will likely have to reduce your volume / frequency to allow adequate recovery. Just one reason to not blindly follow someone else's program.\n12. Cardio burns more calories for an equal amount of stress - if weight loss is your only goal, don't wreck yourself lifting or you won't be able to recover from cardio. His opinion is that anyone who ignores either cardio or reducing food intake is doing themselves a disservice.\n13. Flat and Incline Barbell Bench are the best for chest hypertrophy. Learn to arch! He recommends 15-25 sets per week, for chest.\n14. Because dumbbells require more stability, they should be used for volume, not intensity.\n15. Compound movements for chest take care of most of your front delt training. Additional work should be only 6-10 sets per week, after your chest training.\n16. Side delts should be hit with variations of upright rows and lateral raises (not for your lats). Your technique is especially critical for your side delts to make sure you hit the muscle directly and reduce injury risk. They recover quickly, so MRV of 20-30 sets per week.\n17. Rear delts are hit mostly through rowing, but if improving your rear delts is a big goal, train them very frequently (like every workout).\n18. Arms -> High frequency. Especially your triceps.\n19. Dr. Israetel says he never does cheat curls, but rather sticks to strict technique. Make sure you're not just feeding your ego. Do you want to look like you're lifting a lot, or do you want to look like you lift?\n20. For biceps, somewhere around 15-30 sets is your MRV, bets spread out over many sessions (remember, high frequency).\n21. For triceps, Overhead Triceps Extensions, Skull Crushers, Dips, and Close Grip Bench. MRV of 15-20 sets.\n22. Most of your grip training will be done through your other movements, like pulling. If you choose to train your forearms, though, your MRV is around 10-15 sets a week.\n23. Quads can take 15-25 sets a week. The stronger you are, the lower this will be. He recommends having heavy days and light days, due to how fatiguing quad training can be. Oh and heavy leg extensions suck.\n24. Proper technique and form are crucial. He mentions how he does 445lbs for leg press despite having huge quads. Heavy is for compound movements, not isolation moves. We've all heard going lighter and focusing on working the muscle, but how many of us actually do it? \n25. Compounds > Isolation, but isolation moves have their place.\n26. Squat.\n27. Hit hamstrings with both hip extension movements and knee flexion movements. (he says Leg Curls specifically, but those aren't the only knee flexion movements that will suffice). Hamstrings can take longer to recover than other muscles.\n28. Calf exercises should include a deep stretch to maximize muscle damage. If your calves don't feel sore, you should train them.\n29. For back exercises, stick to 15 to 30 sets per week, depending on your MRV. Stick to strict form, full ROM, and the basic exercises, like rows and pull ups. Also, be patient. If you want a big back, you gotta train for years.\n30. Most trap training comes from other bodypart training, so MRV for direct trap work is around 10-15 sets. Start from full scapular depression and hold at the top.\n31. For glutes, do glute bridges, lunges, glute-ham raise, sumo squats, sumo deadlifts, glute pull-throughs, and glute machine kickbacks. For compound movements like squats, the lower the better, but for isolation exercises, squeeze at the peak contraction.\n32. Different forms of deadlifting have different effects on your muscle growth. If you aren't sure what they are, then seriously, read the article. Also, keep frequency low.\n\nI left out a LOT of quality information - these are just a few of the key takeaways from his notes. If you read through my list but haven't read the article yet, then just trust me, his notes are way better than mine.  Dr. Israetel is both highly educated and very experienced.

I just finished my first year lifting. My goals were to get stronger and hopefully hit the 1/2/3/4 plates on the lifts. \n\n    Stats:\n    44 years old, 187cm, 103kg\n    Days lifted in 1st year: 243\n\n    My PRs for the major lifts are:\n    Overhead Press: 77.5kg\n    Bench Press: 102.5kg\n    Low bar squat: 160kg\n    Deadlift (conventional): 200kg\n    Deadlift (sumo): 182.5kg\n\nI started off with Stronglifts, because I found some information through a Google search. I had no idea how to do the lifts, so I followed the information Stronglifts had, and I went on Youtube and found information from Alan Thrall and the Starting Strength people.\n\nWhen I started, my starting weights were:\n\n    Overhead Press: 20kg\n    Bench: 40kg\n    Squat: 60kg\n    Deadlift (conventional): 40kg\n\nStronglifts lasted 6 days, because I read [this post by lvysaur.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4uijsl/a_detailed_look_at_why_stronglifts_starting/) I switched to a modified version of his program. (I avoided chin-ups and added more volume on some of the lifts)\n\nI continued to lift 3 days a week and after 2.5 months, I was exposed to the idea of Heavy, Light, Medium way of training. I kind of did my own version of lvysaur/Ogus 7-5-3. I know the advice is always follow a proven program, but I kind of like figuring out stuff on my own, and I thought, since the weight keeps going up and I'm doing a lot of volume, it will work out in the end. This type of training continued 3 days a week until August 2017. I went 3 days a week from the end of May 2017 to the end of August 2017.\n\nIn September 2017, I started increasing the frequency, going to the gym 5-6 days a week, following Wendler-like program, doing two main barbell movements and accessory work, but with a lot more volume. I continued, the weights, more or less, kept going up weekly, and then a couple times a month.\n\nAlong the way, I stalled out on the deadlift around 140kg and my back was hurting sometimes. Something just didn't feel right, but I wanted to continue. I backed down to 100kg, tried pulling sumo, and love it. I basically abandoned conventional deadlifts and pulled sumo 4+ months. I switched back after sumo deadlift test day and [I pulled conventional, with more weight, without training the lift](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/803n9j/victory_sunday/dusrp09/).\n\nI've kind of rolled into the last part of my 1 year lifting anniversary. I hurt my knee playing soccer with friends, and it was sore. I thought I might of hyperextended my knee, but I was wrong. I continued to lift, skipped squats for 3 weeks, but continued to deadlift, and played soccer again. I hurt my knee again. I've been limping for  a week, went to the doctor, he checked it and did some x-rays, and he said I have osteoarthritis of the knee. His advice was to avoid squatting and overhead press (anything with heavy weight above my head) for a while, take some anti-inflammatory medicine, when I feel better, strengthen the area around my knee and stop getting older. I'm starting to walk better and should be back to normal this week. I'm at the point where I'm going to see if I can continue to lift as usual and really consider giving up soccer.\n\n**What I think I did right:**\n\nI was consistent. I made a program with a lot of volume, enough frequency hitting the major lifts twice a week and kept increasing the weight. Someone asked me to explain the kind of programming I did, and here's an example of an [upper/lower split](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8fqhfy/victory_sunday/dy5ym6o/). I used Youtube and learned how to perform the lifts by watching Alan Thrall and the Starting Strength people. I used an app to track my progress and I bought a fantastic powerlifting belt.\n\n**What I think I did wrong:**\n\nI should have taken progress pictures, especially early on. I was part embarrassed, part lazy. I should have started pull-ups and dips a lot earlier. I didn't start them until 9 or 10 months into lifting. I got addicted to just using the barbell followed by accessories, mainly dumbbells and cable machines. I probably should have just ran a program, as written and not program hop/my own custom programming, according to the last thing I read or something that sounded interesting.\n\n**What I want to do for my 2nd year of lifting:**\n\nI want my knee to recover completely so I can continue squatting and deadlifting. I want to improve my bench press.\n\nMy goals are to hit the 2/3/4/5 plate benchmarks. I think I have a 4 plate squat and 5 plate deadlift in me. I also think the 2 plate OHP isn't out of the question. However, my bench press sucks. I've done a lot of reading and experimenting on how to improve your bench press, but it's a lift I have trouble with. I just have to get stronger. Honestly, I don't think I'll be able to improve to a 3 plate bench this year, but hopefully I can be able to go 5x5 at 100kg. \n\nLastly, here are some of my Victory Sunday posts I was proud of.\n\n* [I accidently gained 50kg on my deadlift.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/81ww2s/victory_sunday/dv5stm0/)\n\n* [9 months to reach the 1/2/3/4 plate club.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/803n9j/victory_sunday/dusrp09/)\n\n* [312 days to reach the 1000lb club.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/88publ/victory_sunday/dwnplau/)\n\n* [200kg deadlift day.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8fqhfy/victory_sunday/dy5obt8/)\n\n\n\nComments, questions and suggestions, especially how other people who had problems with their bench press improved, are most welcome.\n\nEDIT: spelling and added a few details.\n\nEDIT #2B: Thanks almost everyone! While most of the comments are positive and constructive but some weren't. The mod asked me to remove \"references to the app from your post.\" I have done so, along with reference to the powerlifitng belt.

I'm fine now; Now, I just want to look good.\n\n# How\n\n## Exercise\n\nI was working out of state during Summer 2017 so I only had access to a hotel gym. But as Fall 2017 came around, I had access to my university gym (yay barbells). I workout 6-7 days a week and take a break whenever my body feels battered. It may seem like a lot but it works for me and I love being in the gym so that helps.\n\n1st month: [Frankoman's Dumbbell only split](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/frankoman-dumbbell-only-split.html)\n\n2nd-5th month: [Coolcicada's PPL (Deadlift variant)](https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=149807833)\n\n6th-7th month: [nSun's 6-day (Deadlift version)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nSuns/)\n\n8th-9th month: [Metallicadpa's PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/)\n\n### Before:\n\nSquat: 385 lbs\n\nBench: 235 lbs\n\nDeadlift: 415 lbs\n\n### After:\n\nSquat: ~315 lbs (haven't checked in a while)\n\nBench: 225 lbs\n\nDeadlift: 405 lbs x 3\n\nI did cardio during the summer (around 1-3 miles running a day) but as I got into university, I walked to get to class more and simply didn't have the time. I play the occasional basketball game right now, but no planned cardio.\n\n## Diet\n\nI started out the first 2-3 months only tracking calories and eating only 1600 calories. Then, as I did more research, I realized I needed to track my protein and fat, so now I still eat around 1600 calories (still) but I make sure I get at least 100g protein and 70g fat, which is where I don't feel like shit cutting.\n\nI started out with 3 meals a day but realized I wasn't satisfied eating those tiny meals, so I gradually cut down to 2 meals a day (skipping breakfast), and now I'm doing one meal a day on a 23/1 intermittent fasting schedule.\n\nSince I'm in college, I do drink alcohol on occasion but make sure I stay within my calorie limits. This seems really unhealthy but I do this 1-2 times a week, if at all.\n\nSupplements: Creatine, Multivitamin (Costco), BCAAs (only when intermittent fasting)\n\n## Takeaways\n\n- **Make sure the food your eating is enjoyable for you.** If it is, you'll stick to it. I ate a lot of Halo Top, beef jerky, fruit, potatoes, whatever. I just made sure it was within my macro goals. No food was \"off the table\" for me.\n- **Forgive yourself if you fuck up.** I mentally beat myself many many days when I'd go overboard or go out drinking but one day can't ruin your body, much like how one day can't give you a greek god physique.\n- **Weigh your food.** I started out not weighing my food and my friend got a scale and for the hell of it I weight some of my stuff and the amount of discrepancies is absurd. If you're like me and you like being in control of all calories and macros, get a scale for peace of mind and accuracy.\n\nThanks for reading!", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "M/21/5'10 245 to 184 lbs (progress pics inside) (xpost from r/loseit)", "post_ups": 1465, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7zhpl4/m21510_245_to_184_lbs_progress_pics_inside_xpost/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:24.288007", "post_archived": false, "author_name": "blitzball", "post_created_utc": 1543075208.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1543075669.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "9zzk32", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 472, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1474, "post_selftext": "I read a lot on r/fitness on how your diet should be, macro splits, workout routines, number of reps/sets, etc., but almost anybody I talk to in real life doesn't know about any of those finer details.

I really didn't do it for appearance or recognition, only to change a lifestyle that I know was killing me.\nAt the end of 2011, I was at the lowest of my low, with a stressful job, failing relationships (family and friends), I was really a mess and my body looked like it.\n\nMy dad had passed away recently due to health problems (i.e. cancer) and I really was at high risk for a multitude of diseases. I had to change, mentally I was exhausted and physically I was self-destructing.\nA friend and colleague who I really did not know as well (but to this day I am forever grateful) gave me a birthday present...the book \"4 Hour Body\" by Timothy Ferriss (author of \"4 Hour Workweek\"). This book basically did change my life, after reading it I was skeptical, but after taking a leap of faith and changing my lifestyle, all I can say is it worked! (FYI: I'm not plugging this book nor am I sponsored by it or the author)\n\nSince changing my lifestyle I began embracing other goals which involved career and fitness (as well as repairing my relationships with Friends and Family). With my life seemingly in order I entered into a new phase of my fitness journey (running and triathlons). This August, after years of wanting to do the Triple Crown of Half Marathons in San Diego, I was able to complete the three races (Carlsbad, La Jolla, and AFC). After finishing those races (and PR'ing and each of them) I knew I could conquer any goal I dreamed...now with my sights on IronMan I will strive harder and work determined to achieve.\n\nMy life mission is to inspire others and share my journey, but to do that I needed to inspire myself and have my own discipline. This is my first REDDIT post and I really am doing this because a buddy of mine wanted me to share my journey (I was always content on leaving it private for myself)\n\nSo here it is my journey: http://imgur.com/a/xxE8A\n\nYou can follow me (but I barely use it) on twitter @MykaelNguyen\n\nEDIT: Here are my statistics - [M/33/6'1\"] BodyFat before = 28% after 9.8%", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "My Fitness Journey (From 285lbs -> 170lbs [Lost 115lbs])", "post_ups": 1462, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1pkq2y/my_fitness_journey_from_285lbs_170lbs_lost_115lbs/"}, {"captured_on_utc": "2019-02-27 20:41:24.288007", "post_archived": true, "author_name": "koulnis", "post_created_utc": 1411414450.0, "post_distinguished": null, "post_downs": 0, "post_edited": 1411432274.0, "post_gilded": 0, "post_gilded_silver": 0, "post_gilded_gold": 0, "post_gilded_platinum": 0, "post_id": "2h5m3o", "post_is_original_content": false, "post_is_video": false, "post_likes": null, "post_media": null, "post_num_comments": 527, "post_num_crossposts": 0, "post_num_reports": null, "post_over_18": false, "post_pinned": false, "post_score": 1466, "post_selftext": "I think he took it that way because I asked the question and I am 6'7\" and 255 lbs.

I've seen some pretty trim guys who can use those weights.\n\nedit: I do go to my own gym, but being able to give more flexibility in knocking out at least some workouts at work would be awesome. Additionally, if fit people have incentive to work out at the gym, it may further encourage those who aren't to try it out-- there were plenty of people coming through and checking it out with their fit teammate or friend.", "subreddit": "Fitness", "subreddit_subscribers": 6982518, "post_title": "The site coordinator for the new company campus said he omitted 50-100 lb dumbbells from the exercise room because he wanted to promote \"wellness, not bigness.\"", "post_ups": 1466, "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2h5m3o/the_site_coordinator_for_the_new_company_campus/"}]
